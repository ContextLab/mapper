Hello grammarians, today we're gonna talk about two sets of frequently confused words. Here and here and except versus except. These words are pronounced very similarly to one another but they have very different meanings. And so what I'm gonna try and do is define these words for you and then come up with mnemonic devices, memory aids to help you keep them straight. So the word here, H-E-A-R, is a verb. And it means to listen, to sense something with your ears. The word H-E-R-E, here, is an adverb. And it signals that something is close by. So an example for the verb here is to say, I hear, I don't know, birdsong, I hear birdsong. Oh, so lovely. There's our beautiful bird, there's its beautiful song, and we're hearing it. Now in order to remember that H-E-A-R involves listening, I like to point out that it actually contains the word ear, the very device that we use to hear things in the first place. That's a human ear, all right, there's your earlobe, your tragus, your scaphoid fossa, parts of the ear. So just remember that here contains the word ear. Here, the adverb, however, let's use this in an example. The secret treasure should be right here. And in order to keep this one straight, I like to remember that here rhymes with near, which is what it means, right? When something is here, it's directly next to you or near you. So for here with an A, there's an ear in it too, but with here with an E, it's its nearness to you. Next, the words accept and accept. These are pronounced very slightly differently. So accept here is a verb and it means to go along with or to receive. As in, I accept this gift in the name of Spain. And accept, on the other hand, is a conjunction and a preposition, which can kind of be used the same way that but is used. Sort of in an everything but way. So for example, I like every vegetable except zucchini, which isn't true, I like zucchini a great deal. But you can see how it's being used like but. It's kind of exclusionary, which is how we're going to tell the difference between these two words. This gives us the basis for our mnemonic. So remember that accept is spelled E-X-C-E-P-T, which is also the first three letters of a similar word. Exclude, so accept excludes stuff. And accept is spelled A-C-C-E-P-T. So we're going to say that's very similar to access. So accept with an A, bring something in. And accept with an E, keep something out. You can learn anything, David out.
