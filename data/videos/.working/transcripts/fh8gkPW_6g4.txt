Round 423,275 to the nearest thousand. So let me rewrite it. 423,275. And so the thousands place is the three right here. And so if we were to round it up to the nearest thousand, we would go to 420. So we just focus on the three. We would go up to 424,000 if we wanted to round up 424,000. And if we wanted to round down, we would go to 423,000. We would get rid of the 275,423,000. So this is our choice. Round up to 424,000 or round down to 423,000. And to figure it out, we just look at the digit one place to the right of the three. So we look at the two right there. If that digit is five or greater, you round up. So this is five. So if this is greater than or equal to five, five or greater, you round up. If it's less than five, you round down. Two is definitely less than five. So we just round down. So it is 423,000. Now, just to visualize what this means, the nearest thousand, if I were to do a number line, you don't have to do this. We've gotten the answer. But just to have a little bit better visualization of it, if I were to increment by thousands, you might have 422,423,000. And then maybe over here, you have 425,000. And you could keep going. Now, 423,275 is going to be someplace right around here. And so when we round to the nearest thousand, we see it is much closer to 423,000 than to 424,000. So we round it right there. We just use the rules we just came up with. And we round it down to 423,000.
