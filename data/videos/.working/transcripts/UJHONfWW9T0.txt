Given the triangle below, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the missing side x. And the missing side x here, you see, is the side opposite the 90 degree angle. This is the longest side of this right triangle, which is also called the hypotenuse. And the Pythagorean theorem tells us that the sum of the squares of the shorter sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. So in this case, it would be 8 squared plus 15 squared. The sum of the squares of the shorter sides, I should say, is going to be equal to the hypotenuse squared. And so 8 squared is 64. 15 squared is 225. That needs to be equal to x squared. And then 64 plus 225 is what? That's 289 is equal to x squared. Or x is equal to the principal square root of 289. And you may or may not already know this, but this is 17 times 17, or 17 squared. So x is equal to 17. And we are done. And maybe the hardest part is recognizing that 289 is a perfect square. It is 17 times 17. But if you didn't realize that, you could try out some numbers, or worst case, have to use the calculator. But it's a good one to recognize.
