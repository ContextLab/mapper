So we're told that the first four terms of a geometric sequence are given, so they give us the first four terms, and they say, what is the fifth term in the sequence? And like always, pause the video and see if you can come up with the fifth term. Well, all we have to remind ourselves is for a geometric sequence, each successive term is the previous term multiplied by some number, that number we call the common ratio. So let's think about it. To go from negative 1, 32nd, that's the first term, to 1 eighth, what do we have to multiply by? What do we have to multiply by? Let's see. We're gonna multiply, it's gonna be multiplied by a negative since we went from a negative to a positive. So we're gonna multiply by negative, and then it's gonna be a one over, let's see, to go from a 32 to an eight, actually it's not gonna be a one over, it's going to be, this is four times as large as that. It's gonna be negative four. Negative 1, 32 times negative four is positive 1 eighth. Just to make that clear, negative 1, 32nd times negative four, that's the same thing as times negative four over one, it's going to be positive, negative times the negatives are positive, positive four over 32, which is equal to 1 eighth. Now let's see if that holds up. So to go from 1 eighth to negative 1 half, we once again would multiply by negative four. Negative four times 1 eighth is negative 4 eighths, which is negative 1 half. And so then we multiply by negative four again. So let me make it clear we're multiplying by negative four each time. You multiply by negative four again, you get to positive two, because negative four over negative two, you can view it that way, is positive two. And so to get the fifth term in the sequence, we would multiply by negative four again. And so two times negative four is negative eight. Negative four is the common ratio for this geometric sequence. But just to answer the question, what is the fifth term? It is going to be negative eight.
