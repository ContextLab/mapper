Most of the sediment and nutrients of the Mississippi River no longer reach the coastal wetlands, a phenomenon that has adversely affected the region's ecological balance. This feels pretty good. I'm kind of in the mood for no error, but let me just double check it. So most of the sediment and nutrients of the Mississippi River, so that's the subject right over here, no longer reach. So yeah, and this isn't even up for debate. They don't even underline this, but we have subject-verb agreement where we're talking about a plural, sediment and nutrients, and they reach. So that makes, and we can say no longer reach, well that makes sense, the coastal wetlands, a phenomenon that has adversely affected the region's ecological balance. Yeah, this feels really good. I would throw in this as a no error.
