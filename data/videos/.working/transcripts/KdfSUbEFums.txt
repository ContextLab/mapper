Now let's think a little bit about expressions with more than one variable. So let's say I had the expression a plus b, and I were to ask you, what is this expression equal to when a is equal to five and b is equal to seven? Well, in this situation, this expression would be, instead of an a, we would have a five, and it would be five plus instead of a b, we would have a seven. So it would be five plus seven is equal to 12. Now let's try another expression. Let's say we had the expression 10 times x, 10 times x minus three times, three times, I'll do a blue y, minus three times y. And let's think about what would this expression evaluate to when x is equal to negative one, and when y, y is equal to five. Well, let's just evaluate it. We'd have 10 times, 10 times instead of an x, we now know that x is equal to negative one. It'd be 10 times negative one, 10 times negative one, minus three times five. So three times instead of a y, we're gonna put a five there, minus three times five. And so 10 times negative one, that is negative 10. And we're gonna subtract from that three times five. You wanna do the multiplication first by order of operations, that's the convention. Three times five is 15. Three times five is 15, so it's negative 10 minus 15, which is equal to negative 25. And now you have the next exercise to practice some of these a little bit more.
