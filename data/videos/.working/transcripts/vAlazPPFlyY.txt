We're asked to name an angle adjacent to angle B-G-D. So angle B-G-D. Let's see if we can pick it out. So here is B, here is G, and here is D right over here. So angle B-G-D is this entire angle right over here. So when we talk about adjacent angles, we're talking about an angle that has one of its rays in common. So for example, angle A-G-B has one of the rays in common. It has G-B in common with angle B-G-D. So we could say angle A-G-B, A-G-B, which could obviously also be called angle B-G-A. B-G-A and A-G-B are both this angle right over here. You could also go with angle F-G-B, because that also has G-B in common. So you could go angle F-G-B, which could also be written as angle B-G-F. Or you could go over here. Angle E-G-D shares ray G-D in common. So you could do this angle right over here. Angle E-G-D. Or you could go all the way out here angle F-G-D. These last two sharing ray G-D in common. So any one of these responses would satisfy the question of just naming an angle, just naming one. Let's do this next one. Name an angle vertical to angle E-G-A. So this is this angle. This is this angle right over here. And the way you think about vertical angles is imagine two lines crossing. So imagine two lines crossing just like this. And they could literally be lines. And they're intersecting at a point. This is forming four angles. Or you could imagine it's forming two sets of vertical angles. So if this is the angle that you care about, its vertical angle is the one on the opposite side of the intersection. It's one of these angles that it is not adjacent to. So it would be this angle right over here. So going back to the question, a vertical angle to angle E-G-A. Well, if you imagine the intersection of line E-B and line D-A, then the non-adjacent angle formed to angle E-GA is angle D-G-B, actually what we already highlighted in magenta right over here. So this is angle D-G-B, which could also be called angle B-G-D. These are obviously both referring to this angle up here. Name an angle that forms a linear pair with angle D-F-G. So let me just add a new color. Angle D-F-G. D-F. Sorry, D-G-F. You all of these should have G in the middle. D-G-F. So a linear pair with angle D-G-F. So that's this angle right over here. So an angle that forms a linear pair will be an angle that is adjacent, where the two outer rays combined will form a line. So for example, if you combine angle D-G-F, which is this angle, and angle D-G-C, then their two outer rays form this entire line right over here. So we could say angle D-G-C. Or if you look at angle D-F-G, you could form a line this way. If you take angle A-G-F, so if you take this one, then the outer rays will form this line. So angle A-G-F would also work. Angle A-G-F. Let's do one more. Name a vertical angle to angle F-G-B. F-G-B. So this is F-G-B right over here. You could imagine this angle is one of the four angles formed when C-F. Let me highlight this. When C, that's hard to see. When C-F, this is the last one, so I can make a mess out of this. That angle is formed when C-F and E-B intersect with each other. And four angles are formed. The one in question, F-G-B. These two angles that are adjacent to it, it shares a common ray. And then the vertical angle, the one that sits on the opposite side. So this angle right over here, which is angle E-G-C. Or you could also call it angle C-G-E. So angle C-G-E.
