Khan Academy Financial Literacy Theater presents the menu of opportunities. In a town not unlike your town, there is a coffee shop. And in that coffee shop, there is a barista. But this barista doesn't just sell drinks. No, this coffee shop careers are on the menu. Order up. It's your future. Hey, good morning. Good morning. What can I get started for you today? Can I get a... Yeah, can I get long-term job stability and a high rate of pay? Do you want to max out salary? Yeah, I think so. Just a heads up, the hours are rough. And it's expensive. Probably the most expensive item on the menu. That's okay. I'll give it a try. Okay. Do you want doctor, lawyer, or engineer? You know what? Surprise me. Love it. Can I get a name for that order? Professional degree. Okay. That'll be one very large amount of money, please. I'll pay that off slowly if that's okay with you. You got it. I'll call you when it's ready. Next customer, please. Good morning. Hey, good to see you. What's it gonna be today? Yeah, let me get a... What are the best paying jobs you have that don't require a four-year degree? We got all sorts. Do you want to work in the trades? Ooh. Maybe. What's in that? Electricians, plumbers, machinists, carpenters, technicians, basically. Oh, that sounds great. Is that expensive? It's actually the cheapest thing on the menu. Some roles let you do paid-on-the-job training. For others, you have to go to vocational school. But that's still less than a four-year degree. Amazing. I like a 16-ounce HVAC technician certificate with... almond milk. Coming right up. Name for that order. Trades worker, please. You got it, trades. Next up, please. Hi. Good morning, sunshine. What can I get you? I want to invest in my education, but I don't want to be a mechanic or a lawyer. I might want to be a teacher or a civil servant or a journalist or a software engineer. That's why we have such a big menu. Lots of options and all of them are good. It just depends on what you want. I think I want a bachelor's degree. Great. Good choice. Everyone loves a classic. But I'm not made of money. No shame in that. So you're looking to get a four-year degree without the price tag of a traditional four-year degree? Oh, yeah. Do you have, like, a loyalty card or an app or something? Nah. But we do have two years at community college followed by a transfer to a four-year institution. How does that work? You fulfill your general education requirements at a lower-cost community college, then you transfer, then you do the remaining two years at a university or liberal arts college. Sounds complicated. Yeah, it was a lot easier when my mom was in school in the 70s, when four-year tuition at a public university cost, like, 500 bucks a year. Must have been nice. Yeah. The entire University of California system was 100% free for in-state students until 1970. Okay. That couldn't have lasted long, though. About a century, actually. What a bummer. Why'd you all end that? Hey, I just work here. Yeah, sorry. Got a name for that order, hun. Liberal arts degree. That's L-I-B. Yep. Got it. Call you when it's ready. Order for trades, worker. That was fast. Thank you. Knock them dead, babe. Enjoy. Good morning. Need a second to look at the menu? Yeah, I... Do I need to keep going to school at all? Not necessarily. But investing in your education after high school, whatever shape it takes, can increase your potential earnings down the line pretty significantly. Generally, the more educated you are, the more money you're likely to make. That's not a guarantee, though. Nothing is, unfortunately. You're not guaranteed to make a ton of money with a degree. But that also means you're not guaranteed to make a ton of money playing sports, making music, or gaming. Some people have become very wealthy that way, but not a lot of them. Better to do those things because you love them. Not because they're a path to instant riches. That goes triple for trading crypto. How'd you become a barista? I like helping people. Speaking of... Professional degree? Order up? Thank you. Sorry it took a while. Hey, it's a complicated drink. I appreciate it. You're a star. Have a good one, PD. Cheers. Sorry, you were asking me how I became a barista. Yeah, did you go to school for it? Some people go to hospitality school to learn how to run a food business. But no, I just had a couple of weeks of training when I started at the coffee shop. Do you want to do this forever? I'm not sure. Got a 12-ounce CC changeover for liberal arts? Thank you. Go get them, Tiger. You were saying you're not sure? Yeah, the job doesn't have a lot of benefits. I don't have dental insurance, and my feet are going to be killing me by 2 p.m. But I do like getting to see so many people. I didn't get to talk to folks a lot at my previous job. What would you do before? I was a mortician. We're going to end on that joke? No, I'll do a voiceover recap. It'll help, but... Not much. Not much now. There are so many ways to have the kind of life you want. Investing in yourself is valuable and important. Not just because it can increase your earning potential, but because it can give you life skills like framing a house, or writing an article, or teaching a class, or inserting an IV drip. A professional degree, a trade, a liberal arts education all have their benefits and their drawbacks. Not every path costs the same, and not every choice is a guarantee for success. But it's never a mistake to invest in yourself, and it's never too late to learn something new. You can learn more in Khan Academy's Financial Literacy course, available online, for free, forever.
