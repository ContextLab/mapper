    "correct_answer": "Because copyists reproduce a finished composition directly, leaving few or no pentimenti, whereas original artists typically alter positions, poses, or elements during creation.",
    "distractors": [
      "Because copyists use cheaper pigments that remain opaque over centuries, leaving few or no pentimenti, whereas original artists used lead-based paints that become transparent.",
