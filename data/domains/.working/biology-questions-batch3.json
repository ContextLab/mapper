    "correct_answer": "It is a symplesiomorphy (shared ancestral trait), not unique to the smaller clade, so it cannot distinguish that group from the broader ancestral lineage.",

    "correct_answer": "Per capita growth rate reaches zero because the factor $(1 - N/K)$ equals zero, so births equal deaths and the population stops growing.",
