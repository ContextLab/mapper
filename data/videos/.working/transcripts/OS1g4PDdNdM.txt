Let's see if we can write 0.36 as a fraction. There are several ways of doing it. The way I like to do it is to say, well, 0.36, this is the same thing as 36 hundredths. Or one way to think about it is, this is in the hundredths place, this is in the tens place, or you could view this as 30 hundredths. You could view this as 3 tenths or 30 hundredths. So we could say that this is the same thing as 36 hundredths, or this is equal to 36 over 100. And we've already expressed it as a fraction, but now we can actually simplify it, because both 36 and 100 have some common factors. They are both divisible by, well, it looks like they're both divisible by 4. So if we could divide the numerator by 4 and the denominator by 4, we get, we're doing the same thing to both, so we're not changing the value of the fraction. 36 divided by 4 is 9, and then 100 divided by 4 is 25. And now these two characters don't seem to share any other common factors, and so we've written it in simplified form. And we're done.
