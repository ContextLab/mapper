We will now continue on with our instruction or our lectures on third grade Singapore math. And what I really like about this whole Singapore math way of teaching is that they start with fairly simple concepts, but they really make sure that you have a deep, deep, deep understanding of what the concept is and all the different ways to think about it. So for example, today I'm going to start talking about addition and subtraction. You might say, well, I already know how to add and subtract, and you probably do. And maybe you'll find this easy. But I think you'll find that if as we go through all of the lectures, you might discover some new insights or some new ways of looking at something that you thought was really, really, really easy. So let's say that I wanted to know, well, first of all, you know about addition and subtraction, right? If I say I wanted to add 1 and 2, you would say, well, that's just 1 plus 2. That equals 3. And I'm going to introduce you to what could be a new word, or actually two new words. And that's sum and difference. So the sum is essentially when you say to find the sum of two numbers, you're essentially adding them. And when you say the difference, you're essentially saying, how different are the two numbers? And I'll give you a bunch of examples. So let's say I have, in the Singapore math book, I'm actually on page 18, and I'm just using their problems. I'm doing a few adaptations. This is the 3A Primary Mathematics book. But I'll do some adaptations. For the most part, I'm just doing their problems with a little bit of my commentary. So let's say I had four, they draw flowers, but let's say I just have four circles. And I have seven circles right below it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And our question is, what is the sum of four and seven? Well, I just said, taking the sum of two numbers is just like adding the two numbers. So taking the sum of four and seven is the same thing as taking the sum of seven and four. And of course, if we're just going to add the two numbers, we just have to know what four plus seven is. You should hopefully know that offhand. If you don't, you can count these circles up here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. The sum is essentially, how much do we have when we combine the two numbers, or the sum? Now what if I were to ask you, what is the difference between, between? And that's kind of an important word, between four and seven. So as I said, a difference tells you, when someone's asking what's the difference, they want to know how different are the two numbers. So how different are four? This is four up here. This is seven. How different are four and seven? Well, there's four would be seven if it had three more. If we drew three, if four was three larger, it would be the same thing as seven. So when someone is saying, what is the difference between four and seven, they're literally asking you, how much do you have to increase the smaller number to get the bigger number, or how much you could also say, well, to get from seven to four, I have to take three out of seven. But either way you look at it, the difference between the two is three. And how do you calculate it? Well, you subtract the smaller number from the larger number. So you say seven minus four is equal to three. And that three is the difference between the two. You could view it as, how much do you have to increase the smaller number to get the bigger number, or how much do you have to decrease the bigger number to get the smaller number, or just how big is the, I don't want to use the same word, but how different are they? I don't want to beat a dead horse, as they say. So let me draw some cubes, Singapore mat style. So they draw eight cubes. Let's see, I'm going to try to approximate. I'll do it in a slightly different color. You only use two colors throughout the whole book. Let me see. Well, that's not what I wanted to do, but good enough. Let's see, they want to do eight. So let me divide it in two first. Let me see, that's about the middle. And then if I divide it in two again here and here, that'll be four. And then I have to divide each of these in two to get eight. That's because I wanted them to be relatively. So that's eight. And then they have five. And so five, I'll use a different color for five. Let's see, but I want it to be match up. So that's one, two, three, four, five. And let me split it up. One, two, three, four. And so they tell us, well, eight plus five is equal to, and they say blank. Well, we're just adding the two numbers. You might not know it already. But you should visualize it. Well, it's eight plus five. It's like if you took these and you put them at this end right here, what would be the total length of the longer bar? Or what is the combined length of the two bars? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. And you probably find that really, really, really easy. But the reason why they're doing that is so that you realize how the sum is different from the difference. So for example, we could have rewritten this statement as the sum of eight and five is 13. What my phone's ringing. I'm not going to answer it. I think that's someone getting me to either donate money or buy dish networks or whatever. So now let's do it. This is the sum. That's the easy part. Now what would you say if I asked you, what is the difference? What is the difference between 8 and 13? And I could have said it either way. And that's where writing it as the difference as opposed to subtracting is different. I could have said what is the difference between 13 and 8? Either way, it doesn't matter. We just want to know how far. Oh, no, sorry. Not between 8 and 13. Actually, although that's an interesting question to answer as well. But what is the difference between 8 and 5? What is the difference between 8 and 5? So how far apart are they essentially? Well, if we look here, if we have this blue 5, if we added three more cubes, we would get 8. Or if we took these three cubes off of the 8, we would have gotten 5. So either way, you would have to change one of the numbers by 3 to get the other one. So the difference between 8 and 5 is the same thing as 8 minus 5, which is equal to 3. Hopefully, you're getting the hang of it. And actually, even more important than just being able to do the problem, because I think you find this type of problem to be extremely easier, this type of problem to be extremely easy, I want you to understand kind of on a deeper level what it's really saying. It's saying how far apart are these numbers. It doesn't want you to say, oh, well, I've already memorized what 8 and 5 are, what 8 minus 5 is. We really want you to think about. Boy, it's just saying how different are the two numbers. You literally can just read the sentence literally. That's all it means. So let's say that I had two bars. I'm not going to break them up anymore. Let's say that the length of this bar is, I don't know, it's 90. Maybe it's 90 millimeters. Maybe it's 90 miles. Who knows? The length of that bar is 90. Let's say that I have another bar right here. Let me turn my phone ringer back on. I had it off the other day when I was recording these videos, and my wife called, and she couldn't get me. And she questioned whether I cared about her anymore. So it's very important when loved ones call that you pick up the phone. Anyway, back to the math problem. What was I doing? So I had another bar right here. And let's say the length of that bar is 54. So I will ask you the same questions that we've been asking this entire video. What is the sum of 90 and 54? And I'm also going to ask you, what is the difference? The hardest part of these problems is probably reading my handwriting. What is the difference between 90 and 54? Well, once again, the sum, they're saying, well, what happens when you combine these two blocks? If I put this block here, and I could do that. Let me see. If I put that block here, it would add on over here, roughly about that long. So you want the sum, you want the length of the entire thing. And hopefully you know how to add two numbers, but if you don't, we can work it out. It's 54 plus 90, so let's do 90 plus 54. 0 plus 4 is 4. 5 plus 9 is 14. 144, which also is 12 times 12. But anyway, I'm getting off topic. Anyway, the sum of 90 and 54 is 90 plus 54, which is 144. And then what is the difference between 90 and 54? Now, this is, I think, where it gets a little bit more conceptually interesting. When you think about difference, you want to know how far apart are the two numbers, or what would I have to add to 54 to get 90, or what would I have to take to subtract from 90 to get to 54? Either of those is the difference. And so we could just say 90 minus 54. The way to calculate the difference is to subtract the smaller from the larger number. We could say 90 minus 54. And this might be a little bit of a review from second grade, but actually, it's not a bad idea to memorize it. I'll give you a way to think about it. What's the difference between 60 and 54? 54 is 6 away from 60, right? And what's the difference between 90 and 60? The difference, let me say it this way. I'm running out of space. 90 minus 60 is equal to 30, right? And 60 minus 54 is equal to 6. So 90 minus 54 is actually 36. That's how I do it in my head. That's a little bit off the Singapore math curriculum, but maybe you'll find something like that interesting. But the other way to do it, and we'll go into more detail in terms of how does borrowing or regrouping work. But you could say 90 minus 54. And this is just classic borrowing. We could say, well, let me borrow 1 from the tens place. And that becomes 10 in the ones place, right? Just going back to our place value. So we essentially cashed in a $10 chip and got 10 $1 chips. And then we take that 10 minus the 4 is 6, and then 8 minus 5 is 36. So either way, the difference between 90 and 54 is 36. And now this is interesting. What is the difference between 90 and 36? So what would you have to add to 36 to get 90, or what would you have to subtract from 90 to get 36? Well, let me give you a hint. We know the difference between 90 and 54 is 36. If I drew a block here of exactly length 36, it would look something like this. Right? That is of, not in my drawing, but in the idea, that is of length 36. So there's a couple of ways we can think about it. The difference between 54 and 90 is 36. That's how much one would have to grow or one would have to shrink. Or the difference between 90 and 54 is 36. The sum of 54 and 36 is 90. Right? And also, the difference between 90 and 36 is 54. And why is that? Because imagine if this wasn't here, and we just had that question, what is the difference between 90 and 36? Well, we could say, well, we could increase 36 by 54 to the left to get 90, or we could decrease 90 by 54 to the right to get 36. Well, anyway, hopefully you found this vaguely insightful, and I did not either bore or confuse you. And I will see you in the next video. See you soon.
