Identify each number in the left column with its opposite in the right column. When they talk about opposites, these are all integers, they're really just talking about the negative of that number, the counterpart of that number that's on the other side of the number line. It's an equal distance away from zero. So for example, when we're looking at three, it's opposite in this context. So we have zeros here, three is three to the right of zero, three to the left of zero is negative three. So we could say three, and let's look for a negative three. So those two guys are opposites. I'll just do them in the same color, it'll get messy if I draw lines. Now let's do a hundred. Well we just have to look for the negative of a hundred. So we have a hundred, and then we have negative one hundred right over here, and we have twelve, let me do this in orange, we should take the negative of it, which is going to be negative twelve, sitting right over there. Then we have negative fifty-five. Well the opposite, or the negative of negative fifty-five, is going to be positive fifty-five. It's its counterpart, so it is positive fifty-five. Then the opposite of negative three, or its counterpart, this is the negative counterpart, so we look for the positive counterpart, or the negative of negative three. We could think of it that way. The negative of negative three is positive three. Almost done, running out of colors. I'll use this blue color. Opposite of negative five, it's positive counterparts, since this guy is negative, it's going to be positive five. Positive five, and then twenty-one. Negative twenty-one is right over here. That's its counterpart. Then home stretch, negative twelve. That's hard to read, that yellow. Let me do it in. Let me do it. I'm running out of dark colors. We have this negative twelve right here. We have to look for its positive counterparts, since this is negative, and that's going to be positive twelve. We're done. .
