In the figure above, CDE is an equilateral triangle. So that means this side is equal to that side is equal to that side. AB and ABCE is a square with an area of one. So this is a square with an area of one. What is the perimeter of polygon ABCDE? ABCDE. Well, since we know this is a square with area one, we know that this is equivalent to that right over there. And the product of this number is going to be one. So it has to be one. This times this is one. They're the same thing. So that is one and that is one. Well, it's a square. So that side's also going to be one. And this side is also going to be one. Now, we were just told that this is an equilateral triangle. The length of CDE is the same as DE is the same as the length of CE. Well, CE has length one. So that has length one and that has length one. So what's the perimeter of the whole polygon? Well, if we start at A, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's a five-sided polygon. All of the sides have the same length. They're all exactly have a length of one. So the perimeter is equal to 5.
