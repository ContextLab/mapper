We're asked to determine a function of the form y equals a sine of bx or y is equal to a cosine bx represented by the graph below. So we need to figure out maybe what the a's are, what the b's are, and whether this is a sine or a cosine function. So let's see what clues there are. So the first thing that I notice is that whatever this function is, when x is equal to zero, it does not equal zero. It is equal to negative two. So based on that, do you think, based on what we know about sine and cosine functions, do you think that this is going to be of the form y is equal to a sine of bx or of the form y is equal to a cosine of bx? Without even knowing what the a's and b's are, do you think this is going to be a sine function or a cosine function? Well let's think about what sine of zero is. If you take sine of zero, we already know that that is equal to zero. What is cosine of zero? Cosine of zero is equal to one. So it would be very hard, and especially in this form, it would be impossible if sine of zero is zero to multiply zero by something to get to negative two. So it can't be a sine function of this form. You might say, well a cosine of zero is one, a cosine of zero is one, but here it's a negative two. But at least if you have a one, you can then multiply it by something to get to a negative two. So what we now know is that we are at least of this form, but now we have to figure out what the a's and b's are going to be equal to. We know that this function is y is equal to a cosine, a cosine of bx. So the next question I ask you is what is a going to be? Well let's think about it. We already saw if we had just cosine of zero, if we just had cosine of bx, what x is equal to zero, cosine of b times zero would just be cosine of zero, and it would get us to one. But we're not at one, we're at negative two. It looks like you took a cosine function and at least when x is equal to zero, we multiplied it by negative two. So this should be negative two. So now we have a little bit more filled in of what we actually have. We know that it's y is equal to negative two cosine cosine of bx. And this gels with what we see right over here. The amplitude here, you see that the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value, the minimum and the maximum is four. Half of that is two. Or another way you think about it, we're varying two from this center point. And over here, if you think about the amplitude, the amplitude is the absolute value of this number right over here. The amplitude is equal to the absolute value of this negative two, which is indeed equal to. So it's consistent so far. Now let's think about what b here is. And maybe we can use our knowledge of period, of what the period of a periodic function is to think about what b might be. Well let's look over here. What is the period? What is the period of this periodic function? Well let's draw one period. So if we start, if we use this as our starting point, if we view this as our start, or one cycle I should say, let's draw one cycle. If you view that as our starting point, at two pi over three we have completed that cycle. And then we could start the next cycle. We repeat the pattern over again. Then you start the next cycle. So based on that, what is the period? What's the length that you need to go in x to complete one cycle? So that length right over there you see is two pi over three. So the period, the period is two pi over three. And given that, given that the period here is two pi over three, can you figure out what b is going to be? Well the period of this is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to two pi over the absolute value, over the absolute value of b. And you can solve this multiple ways. You can multiply both sides by three and the absolute value of b. And you will be left with the absolute value of b is equal to, is equal to three. Which means that b could be equal to positive or negative three. And so you might say, well Sal, what do I use? Does b equal positive three or negative three? And so the next question I'll ask you is for a cosine function. So for a cosine function, do you get different values? Is, do you get different values of, if you were to make it this, a cosine of three x or a cosine of negative three x, do you get different values? Well if you play with the unit circle a little bit, if you play with the unit circle, so I'm going to draw a little rough unit circle right over here. Remember cosine is the x-coordinate where we intersect the unit circle. And if we go in the positive angle direction, if we go in that direction, our x-coordinate, it starts at one and then it gets a little bit shorter. If we go in the negative direction, it starts at one and then it gets a little bit shorter. And so you can experiment this with a good bit, but you'll see that cosine of three x, and this is only the case for cosine, not for sine. Cosine of three x is equal to cosine of negative three x. So you can actually pick either positive three or negative three. But for simplicity, in this case right over here, I'll just go with the positive three. So this could be the graph of, and now we get our drum roll, y is equal to negative two times the cosine of, no I said I wouldn't do the negative, the cosine of positive three x. And we are done.
