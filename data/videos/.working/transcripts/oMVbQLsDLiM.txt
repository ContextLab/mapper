The Khan Academy now has about 20-something-thousand subscribers on YouTube. This is as of mid-October 2009, and about 60,000 unique users a month if my web blogs are right. And I think it's lame that we have no way to interact with each other. So I finally joined Facebook. I think I'm probably the last person on the planet to do it. But I did it so that we can create a little world for the Khan Academy. So just go to khanacademy.org, and up here you'll see this little link for the Khan Academy Facebook page. Just click on that, and you'll go to the Khan Academy Facebook page, which I literally just set up last night. And the idea here is for hopefully some subset of that 20-something-thousand subscribers or 70,000 unique users to come on here, and we'll be able to interact with each other. You can let me know what type of videos you'd like to see, a lot of your just general questions I'll try to actively answer on this message board. And then there'll be here for other people with similar questions. And what I'm really hoping is that you guys can start to essentially help each other. Right now it's kind of just I'm putting up videos, and you're all watching the videos, and hopefully you're finding them useful. But sometimes on the YouTube videos, we actually have some pretty neat discussions where you guys are answering each other's questions. And I thought that this would be a really needed environment for that, because clearly everyone who is a regular user of the Khan Academy is interested in learning and improving themselves. And I think they'll all benefit from interactions with each other. So come to this Facebook page. It's public. Anyone can join it. And then the side effect, actually, is obviously we'll all benefit if we can interact with each other. And I can give you all regular updates of what's going on on my end, and you all can let me know what you'd like to see me do more of. And then the other benefit would be you can kind of do all of these things that Facebook has on it. You can become a fan of this page. And then this will help broaden the awareness of the Khan Academy, because I think if you found it helpful, it'll probably be helpful for millions of other people. And the more people that know about it, the more resources that hopefully we'll have to keep making videos and eventually software and who knows what else. So just come here and hopefully this little Khan Academy page on Facebook will be somewhat useful.
