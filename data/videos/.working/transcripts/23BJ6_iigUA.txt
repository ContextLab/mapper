Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy. And I'm Caroline Hoof-Lexer, founder of Duck Duck Moose. And we have a very exciting announcement today. As you probably know, Khan Academy is a not-for-profit with a mission of a free world-class education for anyone anywhere. And we've always viewed corridor mission of how do we meet the needs of our youngest learners, of kids in preschool or who might be in kindergarten. And whenever we thought about this in the past, we always looked to Duck Duck Moose as really the best company out there. I'm a father of young children and they, to some degree, grew up on these apps. And so it was very exciting when Caroline and her team reached out to us and proposed that we join forces. We're thrilled to be joining Khan Academy. Duck Duck Moose is an indie developer and originally we started designing apps for our own children and now we have 21 early learning apps. And we've always been a mission-driven company, concerned about kids and education and trying to make the biggest impact. And I think this is why this is so exciting for us, being part of a larger nonprofit where we can really make an impact on kids all around the world. And you already have an incredible suite of 21 apps, which now are going to be... Free! And really free, not download and then we try truly free because we want young children all over the world to be able to have access to this learning. And as a reminder to you, the only way we're able to do this is with philanthropic support. So if you are a big supporter of this vision, please think about donating. So as you can imagine, we're all very excited that now the Duck Duck Moose team is now part of the not-for-profit Khan Academy. And keep a lookout for what's to come because these 21 apps are just the beginning. We have some fun plans ahead of us. Absolutely.
