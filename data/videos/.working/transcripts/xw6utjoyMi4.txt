Welcome back. Now let's do a problem that involves almost everything we've learned so far about probability and combinations and conditional probability. So let's say I have a bag again. And in that bag, I have five fair coins. And I have 10 unfair coins. 10 unfair. And a fair coin, of course, is a 50-50 chance of getting heads or tails. And the unfair coin, let's say that there is a 80% chance of getting heads for any one of those coins. And that there is a 20% chance of getting tails, right? Because it's going to either be heads or tails. So my question is, what happens is I put my hand in the bag and my eyes are closed. And I picked out a coin. And then I flip it six times. And it turns out that I got five out of, well, let's say, yeah. Let's say I got four out of six heads. That's the result I got. What I want to know is, what is the probability that I picked out a fair coin given that I got four out of six heads? Before moving on, let's do a little bit of a review of Bayes theorem. And I think that'll give us a good framework for the rest of this problem. So Bayes theorem. Let me do it in this corner up here. Bayes theorem tells us the probability of both A and B happening, that upside down U is just intersection in set theory, but essentially saying it's the set of events in which both A and B occur. That's equal to the probability of A occurring given B times the probability of B, which is also equal to the probability of B occurring given A times the probability of A. I think this should make some intuition for you. If it doesn't, it might be a good idea to watch the conditional probability videos. But what we can do is we can rearrange this equation right here to get, if we just divide both sides by the probability of B, we get the probability, and I'll do this in a vibrant color, the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B. I just took this equation, divided both sides by the probability of B, and I got this. So what is A and B in the problem we're trying to figure out? We want to try to figure out the probability that I picked out a fair coin given that I got 4 out of 6 heads. So in this situation, A is that I got a fair coin. A is equal to picked fair coin. And then B is equal to 4 out of 6 heads. So in order to figure out the probability that I picked a fair coin given that I got 4 out of 6 heads, I have to know the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads given that I picked the fair coin times the probability of picking out a fair coin divided by the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads in general. So this is probably the hardest part to figure out, and along the way, we'll actually probably figure out the top two terms. So what's the probability of B, or the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads? Let's see what happens. Right when I put my hand into the bag and I pick out a coin, there's a 5 and 15 chance, right? There are 15 total coins, that I pick a fair coin. So 5 and 15, that's the same thing as 1 third, that I pick a fair coin. And then there's a 2 thirds chance that I pick a unfair coin, right? Now if I pick a fair coin, given that I have a fair coin, what is the probability given the fair coin, what is the probability that I get 4 out of 6 heads? Well once again, let's think about the previous several videos. What's the probability of giving any one particular combination of 4 out of 6 heads? So for example, it could be heads, tails, heads, tails, heads, heads. It could be the first 4 heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, tails, tails. And there are a bunch of these, and we once again will use the binomial coefficient, or we'll use our knowledge of combinations to figure out how many different combinations there are. But what's the probability of each of these combinations? Well, what's the probability of heads? That's 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5. And then the probability of tails, since it's a fair coin, is also 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5. So each of these, there's a 1 half chance of getting a heads, times 1 half chance of a tails, times 1 half chance of a heads, times 1 half chance of a tails, et cetera, et cetera. So each of these are essentially 1 half times 1 half, 6 times. So the probability of each of the combinations is 1 half to the sixth power. And so how many combinations are there like this, where you get, out of the 6 flips you're choosing, you're essentially choosing 4 heads. I'm once again the god of probability. I am picking 4 of exactly 6 of the flips to end up heads. I'm choosing which of the flips get selected, so to speak. So it's essentially, there are going to be, out of 6 flips, I'm choosing, as a god of probability, 4 to be heads. So that's the number of unique combinations, where you have 4 out of 6 heads, times the probability of each of the combinations, which is 1 half to the sixth power. Well, what's 6 choose 4? That's 6 factorial over 4 factorial times 6 minus 4 factorial, so that's 2 factorial. And that's times 1 half to the sixth. I'll switch colors again, just to stop the monotony. And that equals, let's see, 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2. We don't have to write the 1 times 1, well I'll do it anyway. Over 4 factorial 4 times 3 times 2 times 1, and then 2 factorial 2 times 1. So that cancels with that. The 1 we could ignore, 2, 2 divided by the numerator and denominator by 2, and this becomes a 3. So this becomes 15. So this equals 15 times 1 half to the sixth. What's 1 half to the sixth? That's 1 over 64, right? So 1 over 64, so it becomes 15 over 64. So the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads, given a fair coin, is 15 out of 64. So this is the probability of 4 out of 6 heads, given a fair coin. And if you look at it, based on our definition of B and A, this is the probability of B given A. B is 4 out of 6 heads given a fair coin. Fair enough. So let's figure out the probability of, because there's two ways of getting 4 out of 6 heads. One that we picked a fair coin, and then times 15 out of 64. And then there's a probability that we picked an unfair coin. So what's the probability of the unfair coin? Of getting 4 out of 6 heads, given the unfair coin. Well, once again, what's the probability of each of the combinations where you get 4 out of 6? So in this situation, let's do the same one. Heads, tails, heads, tails, heads, heads. That's 4 out of 6 heads. But in this situation, it's not a 50% chance of getting heads, 80%. So it would be 0.8 times 0.2 times 0.8 times 0.2 times 0.8. And essentially, we have this multiplication. We can rearrange it, because it doesn't matter what order you multiply things in. So it's 0.8 to the fourth power times 0.2 squared. And it doesn't matter. Any of the unique combinations will each have the same probability, because we can just rearrange the order in which we multiply. And then how many of these combinations are there? If we are, once again, the god of probability, and out of 6 flips, we are choosing 4 that are going to end up heads. How many ways can I pick a group of 4? Well, once again, that's times 6 choose 4. And we figured out what that is. 6 choose 4 is 15. So this equals 15 times 0.8 to the fourth times 0.2 squared. So the probability, and so this is the probability of 4 out of 6 heads given an unfair coin. So what's the total probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads? Well, it's going to be the probability of getting the fair coin, which is 1 third, times the probability of giving 4 out of 6 heads given the fair coin. And that's this, 15 over 64 times 15 over 64. Plus the probability of getting an unfair coin, 2 thirds, times the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads given the unfair coin. And that's what we figured out here. Times 15 times 0.8 to the fourth times 0.2 squared. And this is the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads. And let's figure out what that is. Well, this will cancel out with this. It becomes 5 out of 64. That's easy enough. 2 thirds times 15, that's 10. And then we just have to figure out what that is. I'm going to go over the time limit to see if being a YouTube partner allows me to go over the time limit. 0.8 times 0.8 times 0.8 times 0.8 is equal to, and then times 0.2 squared. So times 0.2 times 0.2 is equal to 0.016. So that's that. And then we say times 10, right? Because 2 thirds times 15. So times 10 is equal to 16.384%. So the probability is, so this term right here, let me write that down. And I'll switch colors again. This is 0.16384. And we're going to add that to 5 divided by 64. So let's see. 5 divided by 64 is equal to 0.07, whatever, whatever, plus 0.16384 is equal to 0.241965. So that's the probability. Not knowing which coin I picked out, that's the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads. When you combine it, it could be 1 third chance fair, 2 thirds chance unfair. So that's 24.19, I'm keeping the precision just because it might come in useful later, percent chance. So that's the probability of B. So let's see if we can clean this up a little bit, just because I don't think we need all of this writing now. I think we're ready to substitute into our Bayes formula, which we Bayes theorem that we rederived. According to longer videos is dangerous, because if I make a mistake, that's more time wasted. I don't want to delete anything that could be useful. So let's see if we can solve the probability that we picked a fair coin given that we got 4 out of 6 heads. So that is going to be equal to, by Bayes theorem, which should make some sense to you, that is equal to the probability of B given A. So it's the probability that we get 4 out of 6 heads given a fair coin times the probability of a fair coin over the probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads either way. So 4 out of 6 heads given a fair coin, we figured that out over here, that's 15 over 64. So this equals 15 over 64. What's the probability that we picked a fair coin? Well, there's 15 coins, and 5 of them are fair, so it's 5 out of 15, so it's 1 third, times 1 third. And what's the probability that in general we picked 4 out of 6 heads? Well, that's this number, 0.241965. So this is equal to 5 over 64 divided by 0.241965. And what is that equal to? That's 5 divided by 64. It's equal to that. Divided by 0.241965 is equal to 32.3%. Well, roughly 3% is equal to 32.3%. So that's amazing, or relatively amazing. It's a little bit less than a 1 third shot that we picked the fair coin given that we got 4 out of 6 heads. What's interesting is the 4 out of 6 heads, it kind of decreased the probability that we got a fair coin. Because before having any data on what happens when we flip it, we would have a 1 third probability, which is 33.3. But given that we got more heads than tails, the universe of probability is telling us that, well, if you got more heads than tails, that makes it a little bit more likely that you picked the unfair coin, which is a little bit more weighted to heads. But it's saying it's not that much more likely, because this isn't that unusual of a result to get even with a fair coin. So that's why it became a little bit less likely to get a fair coin. Let me give you a bit of an intuition visually, kind of with set theory on why that makes sense. So if we go back to Bayes' theorem, let's just say that let me, this is the universe of all of the events. That's all of the universe. There's roughly a 1 third chance that I picked a fair coin, so roughly 1 third of this will be fair. This is fair. This is unfair. And then if I picked a fair coin, we figured out that there's roughly a 15 out of 64 shot that I get 4 out of 6 heads. So maybe that's this little section of the, let me do it in a different color. That's this section. And then we figured out if we have an unfair coin, I forgot what the exact number is, but there was some probability that we get 4 out of 6 heads. It's actually a little bit bigger. It's like that. So this is getting 4 out of 6 heads given you got an unfair coin. This is getting 4 out of 6 heads given that you got a fair coin. And then this whole area is a probability to get 4 out of 6 heads. So all Bayes' theorem told us is, look, we got 4 out of 6 heads. We're in this universe where we got 4 out of 6 heads. And if we got 4 out of 6 heads, 1 third of this universe, roughly, or 32.3% of this subset of 4 out of 6 heads, intersects with the fair coin universe. So this 32.3% is essentially this fraction of the total probability of getting 4 out of 6 heads. Anyway, hopefully that gave you a little bit of intuition, and I hope that YouTube lets me publish this video because I'm on my 17th minute. I'll see you in the next video.
