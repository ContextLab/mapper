As a hint, I'll take the determinant of a very similar two by two matrix. So we want to figure out the determinant of this matrix. And we can denote it by the determinant of the two by two matrix, 5, 3, negative 1, and 4. And the definition of a determinant of a two by two matrix like this is we can first take this diagonal, 5 times 4. So let me write that down. So it's going to be 5 times 4 minus the product of this diagonal. So minus 3 times negative 1. So what does this give us? So 5 times 4 is 20. And then 3 times negative 1 would be negative 3. This is negative 3. But then we're subtracting negative 3, which would make it adding a positive 3. So 20 plus 3. And so the determinant of this matrix, ready for the dumb roll, is 20 plus 3 is 23.
