I was one of the best days of my life, honestly, like signing day. Just knew that all the hard work that I had put into this dream finally paid off. I'm Noble, I'm a freshman at Brown University. I play receiver on the football team. Became a parent to me when I got to high school. And if I wanted to achieve the goals of going to Division I football and going to school in the Ivy League, that I needed to improve on my SAT scores. A lot of people, like my peers, have test anxiety. First time I took it, I got a 12-10. I knew I needed to improve if I wanted to get to the level of school that I had envisioned. So I dug into Khan Academy a lot. I took advantage of the option to upload your SAT scores to Khan Academy and it would give you feedback on things you needed to work on. I definitely took a lot of stress off of my shoulders. And like having the confidence that I could truly go into this test and perform to the standards that I wanted. By using Khan Academy, I was able to improve my SAT score by 210 points. I was able to get a 14-20 and that was a score that got me accepted into Brown. Definitely would say it's life-changing. I set my life on a trajectory that wouldn't have been available if I didn't have access to Khan Academy. Whether you're upper class or lower class or anywhere you fall in between those, then it's free and available for everyone. And that's, I can't stress that enough. I would leave a message that anything is possible. I definitely think the best beginning spot would be through Khan Academy.
