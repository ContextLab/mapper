So I have an infinite series here, the sum from n equals zero to infinity of negative one to the n power times x to the six n over two n, the whole two n factorial. And my goal in this video is to evaluate this power series when x is equal to the cube root of pi over two. And I encourage you to pause this video and give it a go on your own. And I will give you a hint. The key to this is to figure out, well, what function is this the power series for, and then use that function to evaluate this? And there's another clue here, is that, hey, this is kind of a mysterious or suspicious looking number here, pi over two, that looks like something I would use a trig function to evaluate. That might be a little bit more straightforward. So I'll let you have a go at it. So I'm assuming you have tried. So let's try to work through this together. And any of these types of problems, I'd like to at least expand out this power series. So I get a better sense of what it's like. So this right over here, if I were to expand it out, this is going to be equal to, when n is zero, this is one. Actually, all of these are one, so it's just going to be one. When n is one, it's going to be negative one, x to the sixth, x to the sixth over two factorial. When n is two, it's going to be positive. Negative one squared is positive one times x to the 12th over four factorial. And then let's just do one more. When x is equal to three, it's going to be negative x to the 18th, x to the 18th over six, over six factorial, you just keep going on and on forever. Now, offhand, I don't know a function, especially a trigonometric function, because that was kind of our clue here, this pi over two makes me feel like I might, that this might be a trigonometric function right over here. Nothing jumps out at me offhand, but this does look suspiciously familiar. This looks awfully close to the power series or the Maclaurin series for cosine of x, which we have seen multiple times. Let's just remind ourselves what that is, and if this doesn't look familiar, the previous video where I do the Maclaurin series for cosine of x goes into detail on how I get this. The Maclaurin series for cosine of x is equal to, so I'll just write a few terms, so I'll write approximately equal to one minus x squared over two factorial, plus x to the fourth over four factorial, minus x to the sixth over six factorial, and just like that, you're probably seeing the similarities. Well, the first term's the same, the sign negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, two factorial, four factorial, six factorial. The difference is the powers, the exponents on the x's. This is x squared, this is x to the sixth, this is x to the fourth, that's x to the 12th. This is x to the sixth, that's x to the 18th. Well, what if we, something for you to think about is, well, how can we replace x with something here? Because anything that I change, if I take cosine of, if I change x to, a plus b, everywhere we see an x, you would replace it with an a plus b. Can we put a power of x here, so that these things end up like that? Well, this x to the sixth is the same thing, x to the sixth is the same thing as x to the third, squared, that's x to the third squared. This right over here, x to the 12th is the same thing as x to the third to the fourth power. This right over here is the same thing as x to the third to the sixth power. If we could replace each of these x's with x to the third, we will get this power series up here. Well, how do we do that? Well, we would just say, well, it's a cosine of x to the third. Actually, let me do that in a different color. The cosine, and that's not a different color, so the cosine of x to the third is going to be equal to, and once again, everywhere we see an x, we replace it with x to the third, so it's one minus, and actually, I'm just gonna put a parentheses squared, two factorial, which I wanted to do that in the green. Let me do all of this in the green. All right, so it's gonna be equal to one minus parentheses squared over two factorial plus parentheses to the fourth power over four factorial minus parentheses to the sixth power over six factorial, and now let me get changed back to that move color, and since I'm taking the cosine of x to the third, well, this is gonna be x to the third. This is gonna be x to the third to the fourth power. This is gonna be x to the third to the sixth power, which is exactly what I have right over here. So this right over here is the power series for cosine of x to the third. So evaluating this when x is equal to the cube root of pi over two is the same thing as evaluating this when x is equal to the cube root of pi over two. Let me write that down, because this is interesting. So this, so I'll just rewrite it from n equals zero to infinity of negative one to the n, x to the sixth n over two n factorial. This is equal to, this is the power series representation of cosine of x to the third power. So if you wanna evaluate this when x is the cube root of pi over two, we just have to evaluate this when x is the cube root of pi over two, and this does suspiciously work out nicely, because if you take the cube of the cube root, well, good things happen. So the cosine of the cube root of pi over two to the third power, well, that's just the same thing as cosine of pi over two, which of course is equal to zero. And we are done.
