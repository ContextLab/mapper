My name is Kelly Krumarik. I'm 25 years old and I'm a freelance audio engineer. Some people just stay in one trade, one part of audio. I like to do a little bit of everything. So I work in a studio as a recording and mixing engineer. I work in live sound as a monitor and front of house engineer. In film, I'm a production sound mixer. So my main goal is to get the dialogue on set. Then in post-production, that's when we focus on sound effects, creating them, taking them from the library, fully recording that footsteps, basically recreating the world that we already recorded in a studio setting so we have more control over it. So I went to school for business and I was a vocal minor. I had to take an elective for my vocal classes and it was called music technology. And it was all about, you know, microphones and speakers and music and I was like, what? Like this is something I can do. I just, I don't know why my whole life in music, I had no idea that audio engineering was a thing. Once I took that music technology class, I changed my major to multidisciplinary studies, which is when three minors make up your major. We didn't have a music tech major program, so that's how I kind of finagled it. And then I studied theater and advertising. So the theater side of things, I did theater sound design, which audio engineering and theater is huge. So that's a whole other avenue that you can study. And then advertising, because I knew I was probably going to have to be a freelance person and so I wanted to be able to market myself. I graduated from West Virginia with my bachelor of science in multidisciplinary studies three years ago and then I immediately moved out to Denver. I didn't have a job lined up, I knew there were studios in Denver. I contacted a bunch of them and no one wanted anything to do with me. So for about two years out here, for the first year I did nothing but bartend. So I was a bartender all through college and I was bartending out here as well. And then I found the master's program and I was like, you know what, if no one wants to hire me right now, maybe I need to hone in some more skills. And so I decided to apply for graduate school. You don't need to go to school, but it definitely gives you a leg up on the competition, depending on their experience, obviously. So once I started interning, I was interning at this studio in this past summer. And the way that I got that was just networking. Those engineer meetup groups where I go to every studio, I always talk to the owners. We had a meetup at this studio and I came to it and I was talking to my boss and he said to call him. And so I called him and I sent him my resume and he hired me as an intern. So I interned here for a while and over the summer and then at the end of the summer he hired me on as a freelance audio engineer. Randomly I got a call from a producer in LA, I got a call from a producer in New York, all asking me if I can do production audio for their gigs. And I was like, yeah, that's awesome. And I'm wondering how they got my name. And I find out it's just from one connection where I did a good job. And so they give my name out to people. One other way I guess is that I've been getting jobs is production houses in Denver don't have audio people on staff. And I noticed that when I was researching different production houses on their websites, they didn't have audio people. So I just started sending them emails with my rates. If you ever need an audio person, let me know. And I've gotten a couple of calls from people that way as well. So just being super proactive is and saying yes to everything is how I've gotten where I am right now.
