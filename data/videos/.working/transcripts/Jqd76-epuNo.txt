So I'm here with Amy Jarek, who's the director of admissions at the University of California, Berkeley. And my question to you is, you know, when you imagine college admissions, you know, there's this traditional notion of you get a GPA and certain types of, you know, you have to take certain classes and all of these to be, quote unquote, qualified. Is that always the case or is there a path for students who might not have a traditional GPA or might not have all the traditional classes? So I would say that particularly in selective admissions, our job is not so much to focus on the admit rate and what those numbers look like when you look at the incoming profile. Much more to think about who's a student who's going to graduate successfully from our institution. And I think if we're doing our job well, we're finding those students. And it means that to keep up with the way students learn today, we have to look beyond those traditional measures. So we do look past GPAs. We look beyond test scores. We don't, in terms of the tools that we use, we probably haven't tapped into the very best ones available yet. But we do read their writing. We look to see what extracurriculars they're a part of. There's never going to be a personal statement or an essay that trumps the academic work, though. And really it's thinking about academically, are you prepared for a classroom like the one at Berkeley or the one at Virginia or the one at Stanford, right, to make sure that you'll succeed when you're there. I think for us, we really have started to see students who are branching out and learning in different ways. And they're leading us, right? We're having to figure out the ways to evaluate. And we don't have a whole lot of experience. We certainly have a whole group of schools in the Northeast that are some of our oldest secondary schools who haven't given a letter grade. And that's fine. We work with those. We always have. We work with homeschool students who typically bring us a different kind of high school record. So we're learning. But I do think that the process of changing secondary education is slowly also changing what we look at and how we evaluate for success once you get onto our campus. So how do you, you mentioned academics are very important and completely understand that, but how would you evaluate someone's academic potential if they don't have a traditional GPA? So a lot of what we're going to rely on the school to provide is something that articulates in words or numbers, letters, whatever it is, the type of environment the student is learning in, what the core mastery is supposed to be, and then just helping us understand the evaluation scale and where does the student fall on that scale. And I think sometimes that could be in the form of a paragraph. Sometimes it may be in the form of a chart. But it's not, it's not what we do now is really, we read within context. So it's not crazy to think that we have to investigate the way a school teaches before we can make the very best decisions about how the student learns in that school. And that's something that we just, that's our responsibility to do. We're not in the business of building secondary school curriculums, right? We just need to learn what type of curriculum you have and how it's articulated to us in terms of the measurement of success. So you'll look at, you'll take a closer look at as much context as you can have on that particular school that might be in some ways non-traditional. And then there's also things like standardized tests that you could... Sure. So we have standardized tests that not all universities and colleges that use selective admissions look for standardized tests anymore, but most still do. They are, in most cases, they're simply validating something else we see in the application though. And they're not, for most schools, they're not the decision maker. They're showing us that, oh look, this student is strong in math. Let's look at the SAT. Yep, turns out they're strong in math, right? There's no big surprise. Every once in a while there's a gap. And that sometimes leads to really good conversations in our own environment about why that happens. Is it test prep? Is it test anxiety? We have a provost at Berkeley who's worked quite strongly in talking about the stereotypes, threats, and the whole idea that when you walk into a space someone has already prejudged the way you behave. And standardized tests is usually the lab they use to show that. So we talk about that when there's a gap. But usually standardized tests just validate what we see elsewhere in that academic profile of the student. And there are these notions of approved curricular. Correct me if I'm wrong, especially here in California. I think there's some things that even A to B or there's some A to G. What are those things and how strictly are those enforced? You have to somehow align to that. Sure. So the university system in California is really aligned and it's been aligned through the master plan that was developed in the 60s to be able to allow students to build a path and stay in California starting in the secondary school and moving up. So the UC system as the most selective public school system in the state is looking to make sure that the curriculum in the high school is allowing the student to get the best prep. To do that, the UC system for years has actually evaluated the curriculum of the high school. So a high school, if they come up with a new course, they need to submit it to the UC system to get approval. And then when the application is being filled out by the student, they'll see that course is UC approved. Do we admit students from schools that don't have UC approved coursework? Absolutely. I mean, think about all of the out of state students that are applying. None of them have UC approved coursework. Right. So we are certainly thinking outside of that A through G box, but we use the A through G language to help people understand what the college prep path in California looks like. And the only way we can make sure it's consistent is having a system that evaluates each course so that there's a bit like standardized testing, right? There's something about it that feels standardized so that you can trust it a little bit more. Yeah. And just to, and you have, as you mentioned, it could be out of state students who obviously weren't participating in this, the A to G requirements. And some of those might even be non-traditional. Right. Of course. Might not have a traditional GPA. Yeah. I think that, you know, and we also see a lot of students now, that one of the hardest questions, particularly for students out of state, I think right now when they think about A through G, it includes art. So if you're a student who is incredibly interested in being admitted to one of Berkeley's STEM programs, particularly engineering, you have the opportunity to take a second year of physics at an advanced level or complete the A through G requirements by taking art. What am I supposed to say? I want you to take the physics, right? I want you to have that background. I believe in art. Of course I do. I know why it's a part of A through G. But for that student's development and that student's interest, that A through G equation just doesn't fit. And I think that that's part of why we're, you know, as we adjust to see what students are learning and how they're learning and what are the topics that are most interesting to them, we're just evolving in the admissions process to be able to meet them where they are. And I'll be honest, we're a little bit behind, right? There are plenty of schools that challenge us with the way that they teach or what they're teaching. But when those students come to our campus as admitted students, they choose to attend, they're the ones who go to faculty hours. They're the ones who understand the value of having lab time and doing hands-on activities and research. And I think that's a really important part of the college experience. They don't have to spend quite as much time building up that confidence level and whether or not they should go talk to the teacher or whether or not they could possibly participate in hands-on learning. And so your general sense, and obviously it's hard to make, you know, over broad statements, but a student, non-traditional school or background, maybe doesn't have traditional GPA, but they're able to show that their academic capabilities, maybe it's through standardized tests or they take some other types of exams, they can show that they are of the caliber that y'all would expect, that they could come and do well at a place like Berkeley. And they also show other things, you know, they made cool projects or they have really great portfolios of work. That's something that y'all take a serious look at. Yeah, I mean we would want, from through our process, we actually ask the student to articulate that. So in their personal statement, they might talk about an internship that they had and why it mattered and what they did. Other schools actually might have a letter of recommendation process or a portfolio review process where they'll look at the things that were developed or they'll hear the voice of the person who was this individual supervisor or mentor. And I think that's an important piece of any type of less than traditional model because relying on a student who has only known that model to explain everything that's unique and cool about it doesn't make a lot of sense, right? You need someone from the outside perspective to be able to compare and contrast to maybe the way that they were educated and understanding that student's story is very different and very powerful in a modern way. Yeah, well thank you so much. This is really valuable. Yeah, of course. Happy to help.
