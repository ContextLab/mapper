Welcome. Well, I was just sent this problem, and I figure you can never get enough practice getting the intuition behind intervals of increase and decrease and inflection points and minima and maxima. So I'll do another problem. And this was pretty interesting because it has a natural log here. So I thought I would do this one. So let's see. It says f of x with a big F. I like it better when it's lowercase. But f of x is equal to the natural log of x to the fourth plus 27 and find intervals of increase decrease, find intervals of concativity and the inflection point. So before I delve into this problem, let's just make sure we understand what we're going to do. So find intervals of increase or decrease. So what are intervals of increase? That means the slope is positive. If slope is positive, what does that mean? So intervals of increase means that the slope is positive. So that means that the derivative is positive. So that means where does f prime of x, where is that greater than 0? Intervals of increase is just positive slope. Similar intervals of decrease are just where f prime of x is less than 0. The slope is negative. That's when this function is going to decrease, not too sophisticated there. Now let's see. Find the intervals of concativity and the inflection points. So what are those? Intervals of concativity. So just a review of what we did before. Where is the graph concave upwards? So I'll write that as concave, con up. Where is the graph concave upward? And what does that look like? That means that the graph kind of looks like that. Well that happens whenever, what do we know to be true? The slope itself is increasing. Not just the graph is increasing, the slope itself is increasing, right? Because if the slope is negative here, it gets less negative, then it goes to 0. It gets more positive and then even more positive. So concave upwards means that the slope itself is increasing, which means the slope of the slope is positive. And what is the slope of the slope? Well that's the second derivative. So that means that the second derivative of x is greater than 0. And then similarly, concave downwards is going to look something like that. The graph's going to look like that. And that's when, that's periods of the curve where the slope itself is decreasing, right? You have a high slope here, and it gets a little bit flatter, then it goes to 0, and it gets a little bit more negative. So that means that the slope of the slope, or the second derivative, is decreasing. And what are inflection points? Inflection points are points where you go either from concave downward to concave upwards, or concave upwards to concave downwards. And they look like this. So if I was going from concave upward to concave downward, it would look like this. The graph would look like this. I'd be concave up, and then I go concave down. And this point right here is where you switched. And that's an inflection point. Or if you were going, let's say if I were to continue this graph from concave down, and then I would switch back to concave up, this point here would also be an inflection point. And at these points, since we're switching between concave up and concave down, or vice versa, the second derivative is 0. So I'll write that. Inflection points. Inflection points, the second derivative is equal to 0. So let's use this bit of review to solve this problem. So intervals of increase, decrease. So let's just take the first and the second derivative. That's always a useful thing to do. So let's see. Somebody just write f of x. They write it in my own handwriting to give me a little comfort. Is equal to, and maybe give you comfort as well, the natural log of x to the fourth plus 27. What is the first derivative? f prime of x is equal to. Well, let's do the chain rule. Some people go outside in. I do the inner expression, then I take the derivative of the whole outside. So what's the derivative of this inside? x to the fourth plus 27. Well, that's just 4x to the third. The derivative of 27 is nothing. Times the derivative ln of this with respect to this whole thing. So what's the derivative of x? It's 1 over x, right? So the derivative of ln of this whole thing with respect to this whole thing is going to be equal to 1 over x to the fourth plus 27. Or you could say, that's the same thing as, and I'm going to write it this way just because I find this easier in my head to grapple with. 4x to the third times x to the fourth plus 27 to the negative 1 power. I like doing it that because we're going to take the second derivative now. And to take the second derivative of this, we would have to know the quotient rule. But now we just have to know the product rule. And I know the product rule. I always forget the quotient rule. So let's do that. Let's take the second derivative. So f prime prime of x. This might get a little hairy. The second derivative. And I will arbitrarily switch colors. So let's do the product rule. So we'll take the derivative of the first expression. The first function. So that's 12x squared times the second function times x to the fourth plus 27 to the negative 1. And then plus just the first expression, right? We took the derivative here. So now we just take it without the derivative here. Times the derivative of the second thing. And here we're going to use a chain rule to take the derivative of the second thing. So let's take the derivative of the inside. That's 4x to the third. So it's times 4x to the third times the derivative of this whole thing. So let's say that's negative 1. So times negative 1. x to the fourth plus 27 to the negative 2 power. So that looks really, really hairy. But let's see if we can simplify this a little bit. This is a hairy problem, clearly. So this is equal to. And now since we have taken our derivatives, we can not write it as negative exponents. I think that'll make things a little easier. So that equals 12x squared over x to the fourth plus 27. Plus, or maybe I should say minus. Because this is minus times 4 times 4. So minus, let's see, 4 times 4 is 16. And these are multiplying x to the third, x to the sixth. Minus 16x to the sixth over, all of that, man. This is messy. Over x to the fourth plus 27 squared. And now let's see what we can do. Well, hopefully this would be very cruel to send your problem that doesn't have a clean answer. But let's keep chugging forward. I think this might end up clean. And what does this equal? Well, let's find a common denominator. Well, this is x to the fourth plus 27. This is that squared. So the common denominator is just that squared. It's a common denominator. Let me write the common denominator. x to the fourth plus 27. And just so you know, it's only teachers that will actually give you this on homework. You seldom see something this hair in an exam. But you never know. And you definitely won't see it on the AP exam. They're usually testing concepts, not your ability to chug through a hairy problem. But let's see. Let's do it anyways. Never hurts. So that's our common denominator. So this one is going to have to be that, the 12x squared, times x to the fourth plus 27. So 12x squared times x to the fourth plus 27. And I hope that makes sense to you, right? Because think about it. If we just canceled this with the squared, you would end up with just this term right there. So all I did is I multiplied the numerator and the denominator by x to the fourth plus 27. And then of course, the second term doesn't change because its denominator was already this. So minus 16x to the sixth. Now let me just erase some of this stuff that I wrote up here, just because I can't erase this, because we're going to use this later. But I think we're almost there. So let me use the eraser tool, which is really just drawing a black box. And I think you remember all of this stuff, hopefully. Remember, just so you know, I mean, oftentimes when you're chucking through the math, you lose sight of what we're even working on. But we're just trying to figure out the second derivative, and I'm just simplifying this big hairy equation. And that's actually what this seems to be an exercise in, in simplification. But let's, so I'll draw a line here. Let me just remind you that I'm working on the second derivative of f. And that equals, just to simplify, so 12x squared times x to the fourth. So that equals 12x to the sixth plus whatever 12 times 27 is. So I'll just write that down. Let's see, that's 2x. Well, I don't feel like calculating it right now. So 12 times 27x squared minus 16x to the sixth. All of that over x to the fourth plus 27. Let me see, does that simplify at all? This is 12 times 27. Well, anyway, what can we do now? Well, we can 12x to the sixth minus 16x to the sixth. So what are we left with? Minus 4x to the sixth. Let me figure out what 12 times 27 is. Let's see, 12 times 27. 27 times 12. Let's see, it'll be 54. I don't want to get all messy right here. Let me just get the calculator out. That's always simplest. Get my calculator. I should be able to do that in my head. But it's hard when you do it live. 12 times 27 is equal to 324. So plus 324. Man, this is wasting paper if you have to do it on a notebook. x squared, all of that over x to the fourth plus 27. Oh, sorry, this was squared, right, if we would take it from down there. Now, what was the whole point of taking the second derivative? Well, let's answer different parts of the questions. Because I think we finally got this to be second derivative. So let me erase all of this here so we have some room to work. Because now that we've done kind of our mechanical part of the work, we can actually think about what we've just done. This was just our getting to where we are now. That just is how we got to where we are now. And actually, I can even erase this. This is the second derivative. So I can erase all of that work. And hopefully you understand how we got there. And I can even write it. This is f prime prime of x. So let's do the first part. Find the intervals of increase and decrease. So essentially, where is the first derivative positive and when is it negative? So this is the first derivative, right? So when is this term, when is this expression positive or negative? So we could have also written this as 4x to the third over x to the fourth plus 27. When is this positive and when is this negative? Well, first of all, the denominator is always going to be positive, right? You take anything to the fourth power, it's automatically going to be positive. At least it's not going to be negative, right? If you put zero there, you just get zero. But any other number there is going to be positive, as long as it's not imaginary. So the denominator is always going to be positive. So if you want to know when is this positive or negative, the question only boils down to when is 4x to the third positive or negative, right? And so if you want to say when is it positive, well, 4x to the third is positive when x to the third is positive. And what is x to the third positive? Well, when x is greater than zero, right? If you put in any number greater than zero here, this term will be positive. And likewise, when is this term negative? Well, you put a negative number, you take it to an odd number exponent, you're going to get a negative number. So let's say the intervals of increase. So f of x increases when x is greater than zero. And how did we know that? We just looked at the first derivative and we said when is this greater than zero? The denominator doesn't matter because it's always positive. So when is this greater than zero? When x to the third is greater than zero? When is x to the third greater than zero? Well, sure, when x is greater than zero, right? Only a positive number to the third power is positive. And similarly, and I'll write it in a different color, f of x decreases when x is less than zero because that's when x to the third is less than zero, which will make 4x to the third less than zero, which will make this whole thing less than zero. And they didn't ask us for a minimum or maximum point, but we do have a critical point exactly when x equals zero. Because when x equals zero, we have the first derivative is equal to zero and we have zero slope. And do we know whether that's a minimum or maximum point? Well, let's see. f of x increases when x is greater than zero, so the slope is upwards after zero. And f of x decreases when x is less than zero, so the slope is negative. So right at x equals zero, we must have a minimum point. They didn't even ask us that. But anyway, so let's figure out the intervals of concativity and the inflection points now. So we know x equals zero is a minimum point. We know when x is greater than zero, we're increasing. When x is less than zero, we're decreasing. And now let's figure out the concativity and inflection. That's where we're going to use the second derivative. Let me erase all of this just so we have some space to work with. Let's see. OK. This was a hairy, hairy problem. But in the end, all you have to do is chug through the algebra and have faith that in the end, something vaguely usable will come out. So find the intervals of concativity. So what we want to figure out is when is the second derivative positive, when is it negative, and when is it zero? Zero is inflection point. Positive, it means concave upwards. Negative means it's concave downwards. And watch the previous three or four videos I've done on intuition of concativity. Because I don't want you just to memorize. I want you to always, when you're 50 years old or 40 years old and your kids are learning this, I don't want you to have to go back to the book. I want it to be ingrained in you. Oh, concave upwards just means that the slope is increasing. So that means that the second derivative must be positive. You don't have to memorize these things. But anyway, so let's figure this out. When is this positive, negative, or zero? Well, we could use the same logic. This denominator is always going to be positive. Because no matter what number you put in here, you're going to get either positive or zero. And you get to the left for 27, you square. You're going to get a positive number in the denominator. So f prime prime of x, the second derivative, is zero when this thing is equal to zero, when the numerator is equal to zero. It's positive when the numerator is positive. And it's negative when the numerator is negative. Because this is always going to be positive down here. So let's figure out those intervals. So let's just figure out, first of all, when this equals zero. So minus 4x to the sixth plus 324x squared. Let's figure out when that equals zero. Well, the first thing I would do, let's just divide both sides by x squared, just to get this x squared out of the way. So I get minus 4x to the fourth plus 324 is equal to zero. Let's take the 4x to the fourth on that side of the equation, but then I'll swap sides of the equation again. So I get 4x to the fourth is equal to 324. I just moved it on that side and then switched. And I get x to the fourth is equal to 324 divided by 4 is equal to 81. That's a good number. And what to the fourth power is equal to 81? Well, 3, right? Because 3 squared is 9, 9 squared is 81. So x, and this is interesting though, x is what? x is equal to plus or minus 3, right? Because minus 3 to the fourth power is also going to be 81. x is equal to plus or minus 3. So these are the inflection points. x is equal to plus 3 and x equal to minus 3. That's actually just the x values. If you wanted the actual inflection points, you would take f of both of those points. So the points, if you actually wanted the actual coordinate points for the inflection points, you would say the inflection points. And I'll do them in green for inflection points. Positive 3, and then you put 3 back in here. And the natural log of 3 to the fourth, which is 81 plus 27 is equal to what? 108. So it's the natural log of 108, whatever number that might be. That's one of the inflection points. If you were to graph that point, you could evaluate this on your calculator and get the exact y value. And the other point is going to be minus 3. And it's going to be the same value, right? Because minus 3 to the fourth is still 81. So it's also the natural log of 108. So if you were to graph this on your graphing calculator, and I encourage you to do so if you get the intuition, these would be two of the inflection points. And you would see it, because we'd be switching between our concativities then. Fair enough. So between these points, we must be one type of concativity. And then after these points, we must switch. So let's figure out what type of concativity we are between these points. So what's a, well, actually, no. I just realized. This up here, I shouldn't have just divided both sides by x squared. I should have just factored out an x squared. I should have said, when does this thing equal 0? It's actually, sorry, my mistake. I should have written, I should have factored out, I should have said, minus 4x squared. I would redo the video, but I've gone so far into it that I'll just carry forward. And you'll see that sometimes even I do simple algebraic errors. So if I were to factor this out, I'd get minus 4x squared times x to the fourth minus 81 is equal to 0. So we solved when this equals 0, right? This equals 0 when x is plus or minus 3. And then when else could this expression equal 0? Well, if this factor equals 0. So if x is equal to 0. So the other inflection point, we could say, is also 0, right? Because if you put x equal to 0, the second derivative is also going to be equal to 0. Sorry, I shouldn't have just divided both sides by x squared. In fact, in order to do that, you have to assume that x is not equal to 0. So anyway, I should have just factored it out. And then you say, well, either this is 0 or this is 0. My error. So the other inflection point is the point 0 comma what? Well, if you put 0 into the original equation, you get the natural log of 27. So these are the three inflection points. Let's see. I think I'm pushing 21 minutes. So those are the inflection points for this. And this was an extremely, extremely hairy problem. So what are the concutivities? So all you have to do to figure out the concutivities is try x values in between these points. Evaluate the second derivative at x values in between those points. And if the second derivative is positive, it's concave upwards from. Let me draw them on a number line. This might be the longest video I ever made. So let's see. We get an inflection point at 0, positive 3, and negative 3. And we already showed what these points are. We could graph them, but that's too much time. But what happens at, let's pick some points. Are we concave upward or downward here? Actually, once we figure out 1's, we know that we keep switching at every inflection point. So that's all we know. So let's try x is equal to 1. So at x equals to 1, what's f prime prime of 1? The second derivative of 1 is equal to what? It's equal to minus 4 plus 324. So it equals 320. We don't even care what the number is. All we care is that that number is positive. So if the number is positive at 1, that means from 0 to 3, from x equals 0 to 3, we are concave upwards. And so every inflection point, we're switching. So from greater than 3, we are concave downwards. And then we're also concave downwards over this interval. And then since we switch at minus 3, we're concave upwards here. This was a very benign looking problem, but it ended up being much hairier than I thought. And I even made a simple mistake here. But hopefully that didn't throw you off too much. The simple idea is intervals of increasing and decreasing, when does the slope increase? When does the slope decrease? That's saying when does the first derivative increase? When does the first derivative decrease? Concativity? Well, the first thing you'd find is inflection points. That's what I would do. That's where the second derivative is equal to 0. This was extremely hairy, but we found those points. And then the actual points on the graph are these, 3 with a natural log, et cetera. And then at these points, you're switching between concativity upwards and downwards. So all you have to do is find the concativity at one of the points in the interval. And then at each of those points, they will switch. And I encourage you, we don't have the time of this. I'm pushing 24, 25 minutes. But I encourage you to graph that and verify and see for yourself that the graphs really are concave upwards for all x less than 3 and concave downwards between negative 3 and 0 and see what an inflection point looks like, what these points look like. Anyway, I'll leave it there, and I will see you in the next video.
