So I've taken some screenshots of the Khan Academy exercise interpreting rate of change for exponential models in terms of change. Maybe they're gonna change the title, it seems a little bit too long. But anyway, let's actually just tackle these together. So the first day of spring, an entire field of flowering trees blossoms. The population of locusts consuming these flowers rapidly increases as the trees blossom. The relationship between the elapsed time t in days since the beginning of spring and the total number of locusts, L of t, so the number of locusts is gonna be a function of the number of days that have elapsed since the beginning of spring, is modeled by the following function. So locusts is a function of time. It's gonna be 750 times 1.85 to the teeth power. Complete the following sentence about the daily rate of change of the locust population. Every day the locust population, well, every day, think about what's going to happen. I'll draw a little table just to make it hopefully a little bit clearer. So let me draw a little bit of a table. So we'll put t and L of t. So when t is zero, so when zero days have elapsed, well, this is gonna be 1.85 to the zero power, this is gonna be one, so you're going to have 750 locusts right from the get-go. Then when t equals one, what's going to happen? Well, then this is going to be 750 times 1.85 to the first power. So it's gonna be times 1.85. When t is equal to two, what's L of t? It's going to be 750 times 1.85 squared. Well, that's the same thing as 1.85 times 1.85. So notice, and this just comes out of this being an exponential function, every day you have 1.85 times as many as you had the day before. 1.85, so we essentially take what we had the day before, we multiply by 1.85. And since 1.85 is larger than one, that's going to grow the number of locusts we have. So this is going to grow. I'm actually not using, I'm not on the website right now, so that's why normally there would be a dropdown here. So I'm going to grow by a factor of, well, I'm going to grow by a factor of 1.85 every day. Let's do another one of these. All right, so this one tells us that Vera is an ecologist who studies the rate of change in the bear population of Siberia over time. The relationship between the elapsed time t in years since Vera began studying the population and the total number of bears n of t is modeled by the following function. All right, fair enough. It's got a little exponential thing going on. Complete the following sentence about the yearly rate of change of the bear population. What's the thing about every year that passes, t is in years now, every year that passes is going to be 2 thirds times the year before. I can do that same table that I just did just to make that clear. So let me do that. Whoops, let me make this clear. So, table, so this is t and this is n of t. When t is zero, n of t, you're gonna have 2,187 bears. So that's the first year that she began studying that population, zero years since Vera began studying the population. The first year is gonna be 2,187 times 2 thirds to the first power, so times 2 thirds. The second year is going to be 2,187 times 2 thirds to the second power, so that's just 2 thirds times 2 thirds. So each successive year, you're gonna have 2 thirds of the bear population of the year before. You're multiplying the year before by 2 thirds. So every year the bear population shrinks, shrinks by a factor of, by a factor of 2 thirds. Alright, let's do one more of these. So they tell us that Akiba started studying how the number of branches on his tree change over time. Alright. The relationship between the elapsed time t in years since Akiba started studying his tree and the total number of its branches n of t is modeled by the following function. Complete the following sentence about the yearly percent change in the number of branches. Every year, blank percent of branches are added or subtracted from the total number of branches. Well, I'll draw another table, although you might get used to just being able to look at this and say, well, each year you're gonna have 1.75 times the number of branches you had the year before. And so if you have 1.75 times the number of branches the year before, you have grown by 75%. And I'll make that a little bit clearer. So 75% of branches are added to the total number of branches. And I'll just draw that table again like I've done in the last two examples to make that hopefully clear. Okay, so this is t and this is n of t. So t equals zero, you have 42 branches. T equals one, it's going to be 42 times 1.75. Times 1.75, when t equals two, it's gonna be 42 times 1.75 squared. 42 times 1.75 times 1.75. So every year you are multiplying times 1.75, so times 1.75, something funky is happening with my pen right over there. But if you're multiplying by 1.75, if you're growing by a factor of 1.75, this is the same thing as adding 75%. Again, you are adding 75%. Think about it this way. If you just grew by a factor of one, then you're not adding anything. You're staying constant. If you grow by 10%, then you're gonna be 1.1 times as large. If you grow by 200%, then you're going to be two times as large. So this right over here, this right over here is, if you, let me be careful what I just said, I think I just mistaken it. If you grow by 200%, you're going to be three times as large as you were before. One is constant, and then another 200% would be another twofold, so that would make you three times as large. Don't want to confuse you. My brain recognized that I said something weird right at that end. All right, hopefully you enjoyed that.
