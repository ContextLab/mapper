Hi, I'm Priscilla Chan. And I'm Sal Khan, and we're here to announce the Breakthrough Junior Challenge. For those of you who don't know, the Breakthrough Prize is a prize to the world's top mathematicians and scientists for discoveries that are going to change the world around us. And the Breakthrough Junior Challenge is to reach out to high school students with the recognition that the biggest breakthroughs start with an insight, with a new way of looking at things. It could be existing discoveries or theories, it could be a recent one, or it could be something that you discover on your own. We want to hear from you. All you scientists, tinkerers, innovators in the world, send us your video. We want to hear from you by October 7th in a short video where you explain what you're excited about these days. And what do they win? This is pretty exciting in itself. You'll win a college scholarship, your teacher will get a prize for being such an important mentor in your life, and your school gets a brand new lab for everyone to be able to work hands-on and learn about science. And they get to fly out here. Oh yeah, this is the most glamorous science event in the world. Best science fair ever. And we can't wait to see what you produce. We suspect that you're going to blow our minds and open many, many more people's minds to the magic of science that will eventually lead to future breakthroughs. We're so excited, we can't wait to hear from you.
