Let's see if we can figure out what four divided by two thirds is, and like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well, one way to approach it is to realize that this is the same thing as four times the reciprocal of two thirds. So it'd be four times three over two. And what is this going to be equal to? You could pause the video again if you're so inspired. Well, what you need to realize is this is the same thing, four could be written as a fraction as four over one. So four over one times three halves. And we've multiplied fractions before. To do that, you just multiply the numerators, four times three is equal to 12, and you multiply the denominators. One times two is equal to two. 12 halves, well that's the same thing as six. This is the same thing as 12 divided by two. But a key question is why does this make sense? I said dividing by something is the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. And to think about that, let's draw four wholes. So let me draw it in the same red color. So let's say that this is one whole right over here. This is two wholes. This is three wholes. And then this is four wholes. So I have four wholes there. And imagine splitting it up into groups that are each two thirds of a whole. So actually let me just divide everything into thirds real fast. So I'm gonna divide everything into thirds. Into thirds. So I'm gonna make each group a different color. So here's one group that is two thirds. Here is another group that is two thirds. Here is another group that is, or another section that I could say, that represents two thirds. Here is another section that represents two thirds. Here is another section. Oops, let me do that in a different color. Here is, here is another section that can represent two thirds. If I take those two blue thirds together, that's two thirds. And then last but not least, I have another two thirds. So how many sections that are each two thirds large do I have? Well I have one, and then these is two, and then I have three, and then I have four, and then these two combined make my fifth section that is two thirds large. And then finally I have six. So I have six, I can take four wholes and split it into six equal sections that are each two thirds of a whole. So four divided into sections that are two thirds of a whole, you will get six sections.
