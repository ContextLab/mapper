Let's say that we have the equation 2 5ths x is equal to 10. How would you go about solving that? Well, you might be thinking to yourself, it would be nice if we just had an x on the left-hand side instead of a 2 5ths x, or if the coefficient on the x were one instead of a 2 5ths. And the way that we might do that is if we were to multiply both sides of this equation by 5 halves. Why 5 halves? Well, 5 halves, if you notice, when I multiply 5 halves times 2 5ths, it's going to get us to one. 5 times 2 is 10, 2 times 5 is 10. So it's going to be 10 over 10 or one, or you could think about 5 divided by 5 is one, 2 divided by 2 is one. And you might say, is that magical? How did you think of 5 halves? Well, 5 halves is just the reciprocal of 2 5ths. I just swapped the numerator and the denominator to get 5 halves. And then why did I multiply it times the right-hand side? Well, anything I do to the left-hand, I also want to do to the right-hand. So the left-hand side simplifies to, this is all one. So it's just going to be x is equal to, or we could say one x is equal to 10 times 5 halves. That's the same thing as 50 halves. I could write it this way. 50 over 2, which is the same thing as 25. Let's do another example. Let's say we have the equation 14 is equal to 7 3rds b. See if you can solve this. Well, once again, it'd be nice if the coefficient on the b weren't 7 3rds, but instead we're just one. If you just said b is equal to something. Well, we know how to do that. We can multiply both sides of this equation times the reciprocal of the coefficient on b times the reciprocal of 7 3rds. What's the reciprocal of 7 3rds? Well, the denominator will become the numerator. The numerator becomes the denominator. It's going to be 3 7ths. Now, of course I can't just do it on one side. I have to do it on both sides. So on the right-hand side of this equation, 3 divided by 3 is one, 7 divided by 7 is one. Those all cancel out to one. So you're just left with 1 b or just a b. And 3 7ths times 14, you might see this as 14 over one. And you could say, okay, this is going to be 3 times 14 over 7 times one. Or you could say, hey, let's divide both a numerator and a denominator by 7. So this could be 2 and this could be 1. So you're left with 3 times 2 over 1 times 1, which is just going to be equal to 6. Let's do another example. Let's say that we had 1 6th is equal to 2 thirds. How could we think about solving for a? Well, once again, it would be nice if this 1 6th were to become a one. And we could do that by multiplying by six. 6 6th is the same thing as one. And to make it clear that this is the reciprocal, we could just write six holes as six ones or six holes. When you multiply these, this is all going to be equal to one. So you're left with 1a on the left-hand side. But of course you can't just do it on the left-hand side. You have to also do it on the right-hand side. So a is going to be equal to, over here we could say 2 times six over 3 times one. So that would be 12 thirds. Or we could say, look, six and three are both divisible by three. So six divided by three is two. Three divided by three is one. Two times two is four over one times one. So it's going to be four holes or just four. And we're done.
