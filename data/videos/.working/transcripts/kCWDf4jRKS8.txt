So David, what do you do at Khan Academy? I'm a software engineer, and what I work on in particular is front-end. So I work on the features, the UI... What does UI stand for? Oh, UI is user interface. So that's the buttons, the web page, the things that you see. What does front-end mean? Oh, front-end. Front-end means the side that faces the user. So that would be the web pages, the code that gets run by the browser. So if you go to khanacademy.org and the things that you see on the website, that is the front-end. So what else is there? That seems like Khan Academy. Right, yeah. So that does seem like what you see, but that's almost the tip of the iceberg. Beneath that, there's a whole bunch of other algorithms that power Khan Academy, such as our recommendation system, the back-end, which is what the website talks to, to get your data, and a whole bunch of infrastructure that supports everything that you use on Khan Academy. My focus is just on the user-facing side of Khan Academy, although I have touched other parts of the code base before. And what kind of stuff do you work on? Oh, currently? Yeah. Okay. So one of the things I've been working on recently is... Or that you've done in the recent past, either one. Sure, okay. One of the things I've been working on recently is trying to make the website look a little better on your mobile devices. So if you use your phone and you go to khanacademy.org, making the content so that it fits the screen, so you don't have to horizontally scroll, zoom out, zoom in, etc. Mobile web. Mobile web, yeah. It's also called a responsive website. Not an app, but a website on a phone. That's right, yes. What else? One of the things I'm currently working on is trying to revamp our donation efforts, figuring out what can we do to more sustainably get donations throughout the year. Some of the things I've worked on before was the avatars, making a customizer for avatars. I'm sure a lot of people will be grateful for that. And what's your day-to-day like? How does that happen? How does an avatar customizer... How does that come into reality? Yeah, so it's really not one person's job that makes this happen, but really a cross-team effort. And so the way that something like this might have happened is one of our project managers, Jason in particular, was trying to figure out what can we do to make the website more fun, more engaging, get users to want to come back and do more problems. And one of the things that came out of that discussion was maybe we can... You know, users seem to like our avatars, like our reward system. Maybe we could revamp that and put a little more effort into that, make that more fun. So from that idea, we sketched out some mock-ups, brainstormed what features we could build, scoped it out. And who's we? Who are you working with? Oh, right. So this was back... This is last year. This would have been with Jason, who's our project manager and a designer, with another developer, Ben Camallo, and another designer, Tabitha. So this was the core set of folks who worked on this project in particular. And as the main developer on it, I would be trying to coordinate the efforts. But to answer a question about what a day-to-day would be like, that would be composed of maybe spending a few hours on coding, spending some time on coordinating, communicating in the form of meetings, writing and reviewing documents, looking at code, looking at the code that other team members have written and reviewing that, commenting on it. Why do we do that? Why do we have code reviews? What is a code review? Yeah, that's a good question. So Khan Academy, the website, runs on hundreds of thousands of lines of code. And this code isn't written by a single person. It's written by an entire team of now 30 to 40 developers. And how can you have everyone working on this code simultaneously? The way we get that done is through collaboration software and collaboration techniques. And one of these processes, these techniques, is a code review. And the way that works is you might write a hundred lines of code to, let's say, add a button somewhere. But before you make that code live, before you put that onto the website, it goes through what's called code review, which means that you upload the code somewhere and then other team members will look at that code. And they will look at just the code that you've written, the changes you've made to the code, and they will comment. And the purpose of this is to make sure that we have a good, clean code base that can evolve sustainably. What does that mean? I mean, if the code works, isn't that enough? Yeah, this is great. That's a good question. When you're writing, if you've written programs on Khan Academy before, you might have written 20 lines of code and it works. But when you start making bigger and bigger code bases, when you have hundreds of thousands of lines of code, there's what's called technical debt, which means that when you start, when we just do the minimum effort to make something work, it makes it harder for other features to build on top of that. And as the code grows, the more patches, the more shortcuts you take, the harder it becomes for the code to evolve. And code review is a process designed to try to smooth that out, to try to say, oh, maybe the code can be written in this way so that it's more understandable to future developers or it's more extensible, easier to change. Someone else might have to read that, in fact, likely will read that code. Exactly. All of your code is variables like x54321, and no one's going to know what that means. That's a very good, tangible, concrete example. Yes, when you're writing code for yourself, it might be very clear what this 20 lines of code does, but then when you start writing hundreds of thousands of lines of code, you're going to be forgetting what the code you wrote did before. And also, when you have lots of developers, you're going to be actually spending more time reading code than you are writing code a lot of times. So it's very important to write code in a clear, understandable way for future developers, to be able to consistently maintain a good pace of writing code. So we want to structure code in a way that is not only good for future developers, but also in a way that is sustainable. Yeah, and as you mentioned, technical data might be that the code, without you knowing it, impacts other parts of the system in weird ways. I just want to make sure that you don't do that, and that with the review process. So what did you do before Khan Academy? Oh, before I started working in full-time at Khan Academy. So I was a student in Canada at the University of Waterloo. I studied software engineering, and I interned as part of my program. So internships are three to four month work term, three to four month terms where a student will work at a company and get paid for it. So as part of my program, we did six internships. So each of those internships is a four month work term at a company. And my first two work terms were at Google, second two at Khan Academy, and then the last two was at a start in San Francisco called CIFF Science. And what made you, you know, you're a highly sought after individual, what made you come to Khan Academy? Yeah, so the first, the first time I heard about Khan Academy was through a combination of seeing your TED Talk, Sal's TED Talk, hearing about Khan Academy, just, just, I remember just like when we were, when we were in class actually trying to study for our differential equations mid-term, the notes we were given weren't very complete, and a lot of our class used Khan Academy to study for that. And also on a, on this website called Hacker News where our lead developer posted a job ad. So like, it's a combination of different sources that I've heard of Khan Academy, but I've always been pretty driven and passionate about education. It's something I've had a lot of thoughts about and something that I see can really make a big impact on the world, especially, and I see it as sort of a lever to help, to help people help themselves. Especially if you can get more people to, you know, if you can get like three times as many people working on difficult problems, if you can leverage the full potential of all the people in the world. Like, that's an amazing amount of, that's an amazing multiplier on the impact that collectively we can make. So I've always been interested by education and when I heard about Khan Academy and what they're trying to do, watching the TED Talk, I was like, this, this is, I need to, I need to be involved in this. This is perfect. This is exactly what I want to do. So I entered Khan Academy. I really enjoyed my first internship, worked on a lot of, quite a few different parts of the entire system. And I also just enjoy, I really love the people here. It's a small tight knit family. And after my internship experiences, I remembered just the overall feeling of working on Khan Academy just felt that I'd really enjoy my time here. I enjoy the people and I, of course, also love the mission. So. And since coming, I mean, what's the experience like? What surprised you? Yeah. So since returning, Khan Academy has grown a little bit more than when I started as an intern. What changed, I guess, what surprised me was probably the, the greater structure. And it felt like we were a more, like, a more legitimate company. Like, we actually had people who to take care of certain parts of the company and sound like just ad hoc. Oh, well, just, you know, have a stand up meeting right now and here. And we had, we actually had, like, well-defined processes for a lot of things that we're currently doing that we weren't sort of ad hoc doing before. Yeah. In terms of surprises. What surprises? Let me think about that. What are you excited about? Okay. I guess I'm excited about, like, all the things that we're trying to do. Oh, and maybe one of the things that excites me the most is actually not related to the software itself, but rather something that we're experimenting with, which is, it's called the Khan Lab School. It's down, it's, it's this private school that we have adjacent to our office. And it's basically a private school of 30 kids, mixed grade class from grade two to, like, middle school and higher. We have kids working on, like, mastery based, mastery based curriculum. So you only move on until you actually master a subject. And it's, it's, it's project oriented. So it's not like you're, you know, working through, like, worksheets, but, like, we're getting kids to, like, build stuff. And I feel like I'm describing what, like, when you are, like, this is, this is your brainchild. But, like, this is the thing that, like, that gets me really excited. This, I remember reading your book about, you know, like, would you, would you see as the problems of that stem from the Prussian model of education and would you feel, or would you think an ideal education could be luck? And I feel like the lab school embodies so much of that. And, like, this, this is something I'm really excited about because this is what I wished my education could have been like. Well, regardless, you've turned out just fine. Well, thank you so much. And I mean, it's an honor that you, you, you know, to work with you. Honored to work here, too.
