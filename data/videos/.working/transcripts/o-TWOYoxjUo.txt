Identify complementary and supplementary angles in the image below. So just as a reminder, complementary angles are two angles that add up to 90 degrees, and supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. So let's look at this diagram. First, let's look for the complementary angles. So angles that add up to 90 degrees. And so they drew this right angle right over here. So we know that angle FAH is a right angle, because they did this little half box right over there. And it's made up of two adjacent angles. And these two adjacent angles make up a 90 degree angle. So they must add up to 90 degrees. So the two angles, angle FAC, and angle CAH. Let me do that in a different color, since I already used that. And angle CAH are complementary, because the measures of these two angles must add up to this 90 degrees right over here. And I think that's all the complementary angles. Just these two, they add up to this right angle, to this 90 degrees. Now let's think about the supplementary angles. So supplementary angles, they add up to 180 degrees. So you have angle FAC, or we could call it CAF. It's the same angle. So angle CAF, and then this angle out here, FAB, when they're adjacent to each other, and they clearly form a straight angle, which is 180 degrees when you add their two measures. So these two are clearly supplementary. And angle FAB, CAF and FAB together definitely add up to 180 degrees. So they're supplementary. And then the other one, we could do angle CAH, which is this right over here. That plus HAB clearly add up. They form, they're adjacent. They form a straight angle. So they are clearly adding up to 180 degrees. So they are also supplementary. CAH and angle HAB. And we're done. These two angles add up to 90. These two add up to 180. These two add up to 180.
