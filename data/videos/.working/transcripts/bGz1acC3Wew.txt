Hello grammarians, I'd like to bring up the idea of the difference between a common and a proper noun So the difference between a common and a proper noun is simply the difference between something with a name and a more Generic version of that thing. I'll give you a couple of examples right off the bat. So speaking generally I am from a city The specific city that I'm from is Chicago I I Could talk about a frog Generally, but if I were speaking of a specific frog I would say Kermit The difference between a common and a proper noun is merely the difference between a general thing So the side is more general and a specific thing It's a it's a continuum So If you are speaking of let's see a river Any old river that's a common noun But if you're talking about a specific river and it's a named river here, that would be the Nile say You could talk about a mountain And that would be a common noun because there are many mountains But if you wanted to talk about a specific mountain say Mount Kilimanjaro In Tanzania You would put it you would that's a proper noun So here are the the properties of proper nouns proper nouns are always capitalized And that means that instead of using a little letter a like that you would instead use a big letter a like that Common nouns are only capitalized if you find them at the beginning of sentences So you might say mountains are my favorite But you would also say Kilimanjaro Is my favorite Mountain Mountain And that is a lowercase Non-capitalized M as opposed to this one, which is uppercase So that's the difference between common and proper nouns if you're talking about something general It's a common noun if you're talking about something specific It's a proper noun and the difference between them is that you capitalize a proper noun You can learn anything David out
