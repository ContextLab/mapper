Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy. We're a not-for-profit with a mission of providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. There are tens of millions of people learning on Khan Academy who want to prove what they know, who want to show the world they're just as capable as folks with more traditional diplomas. So we're gonna make a bridge between learning on Khan Academy and real economic opportunity. To do that, we're gonna work with employers and universities all over the world to identify the skills that people need most to be successful. Then we'll build the content and the tools that allow anyone, starting from any level, to learn those skills. To build the bridge between the learning of the skills and the opportunities where you can apply them, we're going to create globally recognized diplomas. We're confident we can do this because we already have the reach and credibility with over a hundred million learners all over the world and we have partnerships in assessment, in industry, and in higher education. Together, I believe that we can do this and when it happens, it's going to bring hope and opportunity to people all over the world. When you see Khan Academy, it gives you hope that there is someone who can bring change and I'm hopeful that they will be able to reach to hundreds and thousands or millions of children across the world and allow them and help them to be empowered. I believe in that.
