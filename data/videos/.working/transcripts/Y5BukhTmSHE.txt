We're on problem 60. Given the equation y is equal to x to the n, where x is greater than 0 and n is less than 0, which statement is valid? So let's see, x is greater than 0 and n is less than 0. So the exponent is negative, but the base is positive. So I'll just tell you right now, your gut reaction might say, oh, if I have a negative exponent, maybe I somehow end up with a negative number somehow. But you have to remember, a negative exponent, it just tells you that it's really just the inverse of the positive exponent. So this is equal to 1 over x to the minus n. And if n is less than 0, then minus n is greater than 0. So you could say, this is the same thing as 1 over x to some other letter, m, where m is minus n. But then m would be greater than 0. So no matter how negative this exponent is, especially if this base is positive, you're going to end up with a positive number. You're going to end up with very small fractions if this gets large enough. It could be 1 over x to the 100th power or something. So it could be a very small number. It can approach 0, but it'll always be a positive number. So y is always going to be greater than 0. It's choice A. Problem 61, if x is a real number, which best describes the value of x for which the inequality, the square root of x greater than 0, is true. So I'm assuming we're dealing with the real numbers. And well, I guess because if I got an imaginary number here, it's actually just even hard to compare it in terms of magnitude to 0. So they're actually just asking us what the domain is. What x's can we put in here and get an answer where we can make some type of sense out of this statement? So obviously, I could put a positive x here. x could be greater than 0. Any x greater than 0 will have a square root. And all of their square roots will be greater than 0. I mean, you could square both sides of that equation and you get x is greater than 0. You could put x equal to 0 there, but then the inequality wouldn't be true. Because the square root of 0 is equal to 0. So if you put x is equal to 0 there, that would work. You can take the square root of 0, but it just won't make the inequality true. So x can't be equal to 0. So x could be 0, greater than 0, it can't be greater than or equal to 0. Not all values of x work. I can't put a negative number in there. And I mean, they say no values of x. No, sure. We can put any positive number there that works. So the answer is a next problem. Turn the page. All right. OK, let me copy and paste it. Which of the following conclusions is true about the statement below? x squared is equal to the square root of x. All right, so once again, let's think about it a little bit. x squared is equal to square root of x. It definitely works for the number 1 and it works for the number 0. If you square both sides of that equation, you get x to the fourth is equal to x. And then if you assume, x could be equal to 0, but if you assume that x does not equal 0, you could divide both sides of this equation by x and you get x to the third is equal to 1. And the only number that I know works for that is the number 1. But anyway, the statement is always true. No, it's not always true. I put a 2 there. Is 2 squared equal to the square root of 2? No, 4 does not equal the square root of 2. So the statement is not always true. The statement is true when x is negative. No, x can't even be negative. You can't take the square root of the negative number. You'd end up with imaginary numbers and it just gets very strange. The statement is true when x is equal to 0. Sure, it could be 0. The statement is never true. No, it's clearly it's true when x is equal to 0 or x is equal to 1. So the answer is C. I didn't even have to do this stuff on the side right here. But hopefully it was instructive. Next problem. I've copied it and now I have pasted it. All right. Let me try with a larger pen. Abilardo wants to create several different seven character screen names. He wants to use arrangements of the first three letters of his first name, Abe, followed by arrangements of the four digits in 1984, the year of his birth. How many different screen names can he create in this way? All right, so he's got seven. So think about it. Let's just think about each slot, right? So slot number one. That pen's too fat. Slot number one, slot number two, slot number three, four, five, six, seven. So slot number one, how many different choices can he put in there, right? He can put an A, a B, or an E there, right? So he has three different choices for slot number one. I'll do that in a different color. He has three different choices for slot number one. Once he picks slot number one, how many choices does he have left for slot number two? Well, he has two letters left out of the A, B, and E, right? So he has only two options left. And once he gets to slot number three, he kind of has to just pick whatever leftover letter is there in A, B, and E, so he only has one option. But then when he gets to the fourth digit, now he's starting to pick from 1984. For the fourth digit, once he has four options, he can pick the one, the nine, the eight, or the four. He has four options. Then on the fifth digit, he would have picked one of the four, so he has three of them left. By the sixth digit, he only has two of them left. By the seventh digit, he's forced to pick whatever's leftover, what he hasn't picked yet. He has one digit left. So the combinations, you just multiply all of them. See, 3 times 2 is 6. Times 1 is 6. 6 times 4 is 24. 24 times 3 is 72. 72 times 2 is 144. Times 1 is 144. So there's 144 different screen names he can create in this way. Next problem. 64. Copied it, and now I'm pasting it. A train is made up of a locomotive, seven different cars, and a caboose. If the locomotive must be first and the caboose must be last, how many different ways can the train be ordered? So we don't even have to worry about the locomotive and the caboose, right? They're always going to be in the same position. The locomotive's first, caboose is last. So we just have to worry about the seven different cars, the order that they're in. So let's talk about, it's really the same problem as the last one. In some ways, it's a little bit easier. So let's just say that's the position. Position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And let's say we just have to decide which car we put in each position, or how many different options do we have. So let's say we're filling the slot starting with position 1. Well, we have seven cars to choose from. Seven cars, right? The seven is different from the, that's the sign, including the locomotive and the caboose, right? So we have seven cars to pick from. We've picked one of them, then in slot 2, we have six cars to pick from. Slot 3, we have five cars to pick from, right? Because we've already picked two. And then slot 4, four cars to pick from, three cars, two cars, and then slot 7, we would have already picked six of the cars. So whatever's left over, we have to pick. So let's see what this number is. 1 times 2 is 2. 2 times 3 is 6. 6 times 4 is 24. 24 times 5 is what, 120. 120 times 6 is 720. 720 times 7, I'm just going to have to do a little bit of multiplication here on the side. 720 times 7. 7 times 0 is 0. 7 times 2 is 14. 7 times 7 is 49. Plus 1 is 50. 50-40, so there's 5,040 different ways that the train can be ordered. Let's see, next problem. OK, maybe I'll just clear all of this. All right, let me copy the. All right. Teresa and Julia are among 10 students who have applied for a trip to Washington, DC. Two students from the group will be selected at random for the trip. What is the probability that Teresa and Julia will be the two students selected? So let's think about this. There are 10 students who have applied for the trip. Two students from the group will be selected at random for the trip. What is the probability that Teresa and Julia will be the two students selected? All right, so let's think about student one selected and student two selected. What's the probability that Teresa is the first student? So what's the probability that we get Teresa and then we get Julia? The Teresa is the first student selected and then Julia is the second student selected. Well, the probability that Teresa is the first, well, let me take a step back. There's two ways that what they want to happen could happen. That Teresa and Julia will be the two students selected. Either Teresa is the first student selected and then Julia is the second, or Julia is the first student selected and Teresa is the second. So if we figure out the probability of this happening and the probability of this happening, then we could just add those probabilities together and then we have the probability of either of those happening. All right, so let's see. The probability of Teresa happening, so let's see, probability of Teresa is, let me do this in a different color, there's 10 students. So there's probably, we picked Teresa first. And then once we picked Teresa first, the probability that we picked Julia next, well now there's nine students left, right, because you've already picked Teresa. So there's a one in nine chance you picked Julia. So that is equal to one in 90. So there's a one in 90 chance of this happening. And then what's the chance of this happening? Well it's the same thing, this is one in 10 and this is one in 90, right? And so you have a one in 90 chance of it happening. And so what is the probability of either of these things happening, of this combination or this combination? Well you just add them together and you get two out of 90, which is equal to one out of 45, which is choice A. And I'm out of time. See you in the next video.
