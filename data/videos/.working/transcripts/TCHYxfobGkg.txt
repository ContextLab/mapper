Emily has four lemons for every six oranges. Write the ratio of lemons to oranges as a simplified fraction. So there's multiple ways that you can write a ratio. You could write that she has four lemons. Let me write that a little bit neater. You could write that she has four lemons for every six oranges. So that's one way to write about it. Write the ratio of lemons to oranges. You could write that she has the ratio of lemons to oranges is four to six. And this is what's going to be most useful for this problem right over here. We can write it as a fraction. We can say that Emily has four lemons for every six oranges. Or the ratio of lemons to oranges is four to six. Now they want us to write this as a simplified fraction. Well it's a fraction right over here but it's not simplified. Both four and six are divisible by two. So let's divide both four and six by two. So we can write this. The ratio of lemons to oranges is four to six. But if we divide the numerator and the denominator by the same number, which in this case is two, we're not changing the value, we're going to get four divided by two is one. And six divided by two is two. So you could say that the ratio of lemons to oranges is four to six or it is two to three. You could say that Emily has two lemons, let me do that in the same color, two lemons for every three oranges. Well that's not the same color.
