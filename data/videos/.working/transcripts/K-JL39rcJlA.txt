Hello readers, I want to talk about how two texts about the same subject can approach that subject in wildly different ways. Let's look at a story told across two different styles of media and as we do, pay attention to their similarities and their differences in presentation. First, let me tell you straight forwardly about a time I went to the grocery store. I needed eggs, so I biked to the store along my usual route. I opted for an 18er instead of my usual dozen, but when I got home, I tripped on the stairs to my apartment and I lost fully two thirds of the eggs. Oh, it was awful. I was really crappy about it. I had to go out and get more eggs. Okay, so that's one take. Now, watch this. The following documentary was based on real events. A simple trip to the grocery store ends in tragedy. 18 went out. Only six came back. 18 count. Coming to WKHM, the 12th of never. I'd like to draw a quick Venn diagram of these two events. What do they have in common? All right, so here are the things that the two depictions have in common, right? They both contain a depiction of the event, the number of eggs that I bought and then lost. So I bought 18. I lost 12. Only six remained. And let me label this. The one on the left is my version, the original version, and the one on the right is the movie version. Now, here are some things that they don't have in common. My version has a straightforward tone, and the movie version has this big overdramatic tone, right? My version describes irritation. The second version calls it a tragedy. My version has no music, and the movie version has this intense music. The purpose of these two accounts is different. One is to inform. There's me telling you a story. The other is to entertain. Here's a trailer for a movie coming to theaters. It can be illuminating to compare two versions of the same story, because certain aspects of the story get magnified in each medium. Me telling you the story amplifies how crabby I felt, whereas if we pretend someone else was making the film adaptation of a team count, they might choose to focus on a different aspect, the drama and the tragedy of losing the eggs themselves. Right? Probably there's lots of slow motion shots as each egg individually bursts on the stairs, desperately sad violin music behind it. Anyway, the point is that next time you go see a movie version of your favorite book or video game, or the next time you're reading two different accounts of the same event or topic, think about what elements are emphasized in each one. What does one medium do well that another one does poorly? Food for thought. Well, no eggs for thought. Anyway, I'm fresh out, but I'm cha! You can learn anything. David out.
