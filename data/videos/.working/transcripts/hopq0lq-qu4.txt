Welcome to the Khan Academy. The goal of this video is to show you all the different things that Khan Academy has. It has videos, it has exercises, it has an adaptive super, I guess you could call it robot tutor thing that will guide you through content and make sure you master it. And so let's just take each of those one by one. So many of y'all are probably coming to the science and saying, hey, I have an exam tomorrow on DNA or I didn't understand quite what's happening in class. Well there, the best thing to do might just be go to the search bar, let me make sure you can see the search bar, to go to the search bar and you can search for DNA. And when you do that, you see that, well, your first choice right over here is a DNA video and this is actually the main video on DNA in which you could start watching. Or if you look to the right, right over here, you see that there's all other related videos under heredity and genetics. And then you can start browsing from there. You could say, okay, let me back up a second. Let me go back to just all of biology and I can see all of the sections are there. Similarly, you might wanna search for something in mathematics. You might wanna say, oh, you know, I have a question about quadratics. Quadratics? So I'm gonna do a search there. Like, okay, well, let's see, there's something about using the quadratic formula, factoring quadratics do. Well, I don't know which of these is right for me so let me just, let me just, let me just go into one of these and start getting a little bit of context. And so you see that this, this, what I actually just clicked on is actually an exercise that gets me to solve quadratics by factoring two. And I wanna, I need to write my answer here. If I don't know the answer, I have a bunch of hints. If this all looks like a Greek to me, I can click on a, I can click on a video that solves a very similar problem. Or I might say, hey, you know, this isn't what I was looking for, but look, I look over here, there's solving a quadratic equation by factoring, factoring quadratic equations. Maybe this is what I need to learn. Or maybe, I'm not even thinking about this stuff so let me just move up a level to quadratic equations. And now I can see the whole topic here. Solving quadratics by taking the square root, solving quadratics by factoring, completing the square, the quadratic formula, quadratic equation, graphing quadratics. Now in general, if you just wanna browse, you say, hey, let me just see all the subjects that are available on Khan Academy, you can go to this dropdown right over here. And this starts to give you a sense of the breadth of the content on Khan Academy. So just in math, each of these is an entire subject. So K through second math, you have, early you have a pre-calculus, goes all the way up to multi-variable calculus, integral calculus. And if I were to click on any one of these things, if I were to click on any one of these things, it's going to take me into something called a mission. So a mission, it's going to give me a set of exercises, we call this right over here, the mission warmup. And based on how I perform on these calculus questions, the system is trying to get a sense of what I know and don't know, and then it will use that to give me guided practice so that I can learn more and more and more calculus, eventually mastering calculus. At any point, if I have difficulty, there's always videos here that will help me understand the actual calculus. And so once I'm done with that, I will go to this dashboard and it'll just tell me about how much have I progressed in integral calculus, what have I mastered, what have I not practiced yet, what are my different bradges. Now, if you do not wanna move immediately into this mission world and you wanna say, hey, well, what does Khan Academy have when it comes to calculus in an unguided way? Well, that's where you go full, you full list of integral calculus content. And then you will go to this page where you see the breadth and scope of the integral content, integrals, integrational techniques, integration applications, sequences and series, AP calculus practice problems. And if you click there, you see the different tutorials within them, indefinite integrals is antiderivative, area under a rate function is net change. So hopefully that gives you a sense of things and we don't just have math and we just don't have science. We have a whole section here on computer programming, which is tons of fun where you can write your own, you can write your own computer programs. This, these are, I'm losing my son's account right now. These are, this is a computer program that we wrote. This right here is a computer program that we wrote together the other day. It was very, it was good father-son bonding time. And we have things in the arts and humanities like history and art history, which is also very, very, very exciting. And we have partner content. We have partner content from the likes of, from the likes of the Museum of Modern Art, Exploratorium, JP Getty Museum, the British Museum. So a lot of stuff here. Hopefully this video gives you a flavor of the different ways that you can use Khan Academy.
