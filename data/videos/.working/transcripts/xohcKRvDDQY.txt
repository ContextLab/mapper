Which of the following real numbers are rational? Now for a number to be rational, it means that it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. So for example, the number 2 is rational because it can be expressed as 2 over 1. Now let's see which of these can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. So we have 0.3737. This is the same thing as 3,737 10,000. So we can write it literally as 3,737 over 10,000. These two are equivalent. I've just restated this as the ratio of two integers. So this is rational. Check. 12 over 31. Well, it's already expressed as the ratio of two integers. So this also is rational. Square root of 11. So the square root of any non-perfect square is going to be irrational. And 11 definitely is not a perfect square. So this right over here is not going to be rational, or we would say that it is irrational. 0.444444. So in general, any decimal that's terminating, and this is terminating because you only have a finite number of 4's here. You have six of them. You have a bunch, but you have only six. Or even if you just kept repeating forever, so something that keeps repeating on and on and on forever, all of those can be converted to a ratio of integers. And in this one in particular, this is the same thing as 444,444 over 1 million. In fact, if you were to say this, this is 444,444 millions that they have right over here. But I've just expressed it as the ratio of two integers. So this right over here is definitely rational. Now here you have 2 plus square root of 8. If I just had 2 by itself, well, 2 is 2 over 1. That would be rational. But if I'm adding a rational to something that is irrational, then the combination is going to be irrational. And the square root of 8 is irrational. 8 is not a perfect square. So this one right over here is not rational or irrational. So we would call it irrational. So the three real numbers that are rational are this one, this one, and this one.
