We're now on question five. People feel a keen sense of bonding when they sing together. All right, so that sentence seems like it's grammatically correct. Let's see what the question says. Which choice most effectively establishes the main topic of the paragraph? Okay, I see. They either want us to say, okay, we could have no change and say, this sentence is what we would keep as our topic sentence, or maybe we would replace it with one of these other options. Well, to figure out how we could establish the main topic of the paragraph, I guess we're gonna have to read the paragraph. So I would actually probably come back to question five after reading, after going all the way through question nine. So let's see if we can do that in this video. Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe of the brain and releases endorphins. Endorphins blunt pain and engender feelings of pleasure. So this right over here, so for number six, we can just kind of do a period and then do another sentence. It's not grammatically incorrect. I mean, it's fine to say that singing stimulates the right temporal lobe of the brain and releases endorphins, that's a sentence. And then to say endorphins blunt pain and engender feelings of pleasure. But these two sentences are very connected. In fact, the second sentence right over here is giving us clarity on what endorphins are. So I would think about kind of connecting them a little bit better. So let's see what the choices are here. So the first one is, well they actually didn't put no change here, so they definitely want us to change it. I guess the way this is written. So the first choice is, singing stimulates the right temporal lobe of the brain and releases endorphins, which end up blunting and engender feelings of pleasure. Now that's not right, I mean, just even looking, saying end up blunting and engender. Those two verbs aren't even in the same tense. Blunting, yeah, this is, you know, blunting and engender, no, it's not, it's breaking your parallel construction, so to speak. Endorphins, which blunt, let's see. Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe of the brain and releases endorphins, which blunt pain and engender feelings of pleasure. Yeah, that one could work, and it connects them better. Let's see, see, endorphins, but they blunt. No, you don't want to contradict it, we're just explaining what endorphins do. This last choice, endorphins and they blunt. No, I think this is very clear when you say which blunt, you're clarifying what endorphins do, so I like B there. All right, let's keep going. So now we can go to question seven. So cortisol, a hormonal reaction to stress, and the secretion of which the brain controls decreases after choir singing. All right, so cortisol is a stress hormone, and it decreases after choir singing. Meanwhile, oxytocin, which the brain interprets as a feeling of emotional bonding, is increased. So these are all describing ways that make people feel better, and I want to read this entire paragraph because at the end I want to go back to question five and think about the topic sentence. So all of these good things are happening. In a study at Oxford Brooks University, a researcher surveyed 375 people who either sang alone, sang in a choir, or participated in organized boards. Those who sang in choir reported the highest levels of happiness. So everything we're talking about is, wow, this choir singing really can make people happier. So, and they're kind of citing even chemical, we can point to chemical things happening in the brain that are actually associated with more happiness and less stress. Due to its positive side effects, therapists have used choir singing as an element for those dealing with depression and chronic pain. So I kind of like the due to its positive side effects because that is the reason why therapists would use it. But let's just look at the other choices. So I like due to, that's my default. So despite its positive side effects, therapists have used choir singing? No, I mean they're using it because of the positive side effects due to the positive side effects. This isn't a contradiction to the fact that it has positive side effects. It's not, you know, if it was despite the fact that it's bad for people, therapists are using it. That would, you know, that would be a reason to use the word despite, but no, that doesn't make sense. In addition to its positive side effects, therapists have used choir singing as an element for those dealing with depression and chronic pain. Well, it's not an addition. It's saying, it's giving the causality because due to its positive side effects, this is why therapists are thinking about using it as a way to deal with depression and chronic pain. And then besides, once again, it's not a besides. The therapists have used choir singing. That's because due to the positive side effects, it isn't on top of or, you know, another thing that's seemingly unrelated. So I definitely would go with no change. And let's go to question eight. And once again, I'm using a prototype version where it says six out of five, seven out of five. Obviously should not be out of five because there's more than five questions here. So let's go to question eight. So due to its positive side effects, therapists have used choir singing as an element for those dealing with depression and chronic pain. An element feels a little weird. An element of what? Let's see what the other options are. An accessory for those dealing with depression and chronic pain. An accessory, I imagine, more of a bit of a, you know, it wouldn't be a process like choir singing. It wouldn't be an activity. I wouldn't call it an activity, an accessory, a, or a piece. I mean, well, accessory doesn't feel right there. Let's see. Choir singing as a supplement for those dealing with depression and chronic pain. A supplement could be good because, you know, you wouldn't make this the primary treatment if someone has severe depression or chronic pain. You wouldn't just say, hey, why don't you go start in a choir, go start singing in a choir. There's other things that the therapist would probably do to help alleviate or deal with the depression and chronic pain, but it would be a supplement above and beyond what kind of the more traditional methods might be. This could be something to do on top of that. Now an addendum. An addendum, once again, this is like something that you add on to other things, and so it kind of is like a supplement, but, you know, I view an addendum to kind of a presentation or to a kind of a position paper or something. Something I add on to the back of something like that, like a proposal, I wouldn't use that word if I was talking about, you know, kind of treatment or dealing with something. And that's kind of how I feel about accessory. Accessory is something that kind of adds on, but I think an accessory is more of like a watch or a purse or something, not as much as an element to kind of go above and beyond the existing treatment. I like the word supplement here. But let's keep going. A study from an arts and health research center in Canterbury, England followed, sorry, a study from an arts and health research center in Canterbury, England, followed the progress of patients diagnosed with depression for a year after they joined a choir. 60% of patients reported improved mental health at the end of the year, and some were no longer experiencing suffering from clinical depression. So experiencing suffering, that sounds weird. I would say we're no longer suffering from clinical depression maybe, or no longer experiencing symptoms of clinical depression, but I wouldn't have experiencing and suffering there. I would get rid of one of them. Let's see what our options are. And some were no longer reporting that they were suffering from clinical depression. I mean, that reads well. And some were no longer reporting that they were suffering from clinical depression, but it still feels a little bit heavy. Reporting that they were suffering, is that necessary? You could just say some were no longer suffering. Let's see this next one. And some were no longer suffering from clinical depression by the end of the year. Well, this one is tempting, but we already said at the end of the year, at the end of that year, and then to say by the end of that year again, 60% of patients reported mental health at the end of that year, and some were no longer suffering clinical depression by the end of that year. You're saying by the end of that year twice. That's redundant. If it just said suffering from clinical depression, I actually wouldn't mind this choice. Let's see. I hope D works out well. 60% of patients reported improved mental health at the end of that year, and some were no longer clinically depressed. Yeah, that feels good. Nice and clean. Gets the point across. All right, so we've answered through nine, but we've got to remember, we skipped five, because five is about, well, what's a good topic sentence for that entire paragraph? So everything they talked about up here, they're just talking about, hey, look, it makes people feel feelings of pleasure, and they even see it in the endorphins. You feel less stress. The stress hormone decreases. You feel feeling of emotional bonding goes up. And then to give even more evidence, they say the researchers have even used it to help alleviate, to deal with depression and chronic pain. So let's see. These choices, singing in a choir can help prevent depression. Well, that's the second half of the paragraph does talk about that, but that's not the whole paragraph. The whole paragraph isn't just about depression. They are using depression as an example of how singing in a choir can make you feel better. So I wouldn't say that this is a topic. If this was a topic sentence, I don't know whether I would go as heavily on all of this other stuff here. I'd probably just start right over here. Let's see. The brain tends to respond favorably to group singing. Yeah, I think this is good. The brain tends to respond favorably to group singing. Let's see how that reads. The brain tends to respond favorably to group singing. Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe of the brain and releases endorphins. Yeah, we go straight into talking about the brain. Endorphins, blunt pain, and engender feelings of pleasure. So we're talking about all these ways that the brain reacts. And even when we're talking about depression, we're talking about how it helps the brain deal with these things. So yeah, I like choice C there. So yeah, we've done all the way through question nine. So in the next video, we can do the last few questions.
