A party goods company is making novelty crowns out of paper. They start with a rectangular piece of paper and then cut three semicircles, each with a six inch diameter, out of the top to create a crown. So they start with a rectangle, and then they cut these semicircles out of the top of that rectangle. Find the area and perimeter of the crown below. So let's just start with the perimeter of it. So we have to find the lengths of each of these semicircle arcs right over here, and then add those, and then add them to these lengths over here, which that latter part is pretty straightforward. But let's just think about how long this is right over here that I'm highlighting in blue. And we know that this is a semicircle. It is half of a full circle that has diameter six. And if we wanted to know the circumference of the entire circle, the circumference of this entire circle is given by, and this really comes straight out of the definition of pi, it's pi times the diameter. Or another way to think about it, the diameter so it's 2 pi times the radius. But they give us the diameter right over here. The diameter is 6 inches. So the circumference, this entire circumference right over here, is going to be equal to 6 pi. That's the circumference of the entire circle. If we think about the circumference of one of the semicircles, so circumference of, or maybe I should say the length of a semicircle, is going to be half of this. It's half the circle. So this length right over here is going to be 3 pi. And then this one, the exact same length, is going to be 3 pi again, half of the circumference of the entire circle. And then this over here is going to be 3 pi again. And now we're ready to figure out the perimeter. You have three 3 pi's. So it's going to be 3 times 3 pi plus 6 inches plus 6 plus 18 plus 6 again. So this is 9 pi. That's this part right over there. 9 pi plus, so this is going to be 12 plus 18 plus 30. That's the perimeter. And if we wanted to, let me write this down. This is equal to the perimeter. And if we wanted to get the exact number, you could substitute 3.14 for a rough approximation of pi. Or we could get our calculator out or pretty close to the exact number. Even a calculator doesn't have an infinite precision for pi. But let's get the calculator out. And if we want to get 9 pi, 9 times pi, plus 30, that gets us 58 point, and I'll just round to the 100, it's 58.27 inches. So it's equal to 58.27 inches because all of these units are at 52. 58.27 inches. That's our perimeter. Now let's think about the area. To figure out the area, what we can do is we can figure out the area of the rectangle before they cut out these circles, so the area of the entire rectangle. And then we can subtract from that the area of these semicircles. So the area of the rectangle is just the base times the height. It's equal to 18 times 6 inches. Let me write the units down. 18 inches times 6 inches. And this is equal to 10 times 6 is 60, 8 times 6 is 48. So it becomes 108 inches squared. That's the area of the entire rectangle. We're not done yet because we haven't cut out the semicircles. The area, if these were complete circles, if you think about them as complete circles, the area of a complete circle is pi r squared. So area of a circle is going to be pi times the radius squared. The diameter here is 6. The radius here is going to be 3. So the radius is going to be 3 inches. So it's pi times 3 inches squared, which is equal to 9 pi square inches. That's for each of these complete circles. So it's 9 pi for each of the complete ones. If you take half of them, I'll write it over here, area of the semicircle is going to be 9 pi over 2 inches or squared inches. And we have three of them. We have three of these semicircles. So the area of this crown, I'll do this in pink, the area of the crown is going to be equal to the area of the rectangle, which is 108 square inches, minus 3 times the area of the semicircles. Minus this, minus this, minus this, minus 3 of the semicircles, minus 3 times 9 pi over 2 inches squared. This is equal to 108 minus 27 over 2 pi inches squared. And you could leave it that way if you just wanted to leave it in terms of pi. But as we know, pi is a number, and we can use our calculator to evaluate it. We get the calculator out. We have 108 minus 27. I'll just write it as 27 pi over 2. 27 pi divided by 2. 108 minus 27 pi divided by 2 will give us 65, and if I round to the 100, 65.59 inches, square inches, to be exact, or to get the right units. 65.59 square inches. This is equal to 65.59 inches squared, and we are done.
