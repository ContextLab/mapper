If there are six people in your family and each person drinks 4 fifths of a gallon of milk each month, between what two whole numbers is the number of gallons of milk your family will drink each month? So let's think about this a little bit. So I got my milk gallon here for inspiration. So there's six people in my family or in your family, whoever's family we're talking about, and each of them drink 4 fifths of a gallon per month. So we're going to go 6 times 4 fifths or 4 fifths times 6. Now, what is this going to be equal to? Well, there's several ways that we could think about this. One, we can express 6 as a fraction. We could say that this is the same thing as 6 over 1 times 4 fifths times 4 fifths. And you multiply the numerators, you multiply the denominators. 6 times 4 is 24. And 1 times 5 is 5. So 24 fifths gallons are going to be drunk every month. And this is the same thing. Let's see. 5 goes into 20 evenly and has a remainder of 4. So we could write this as 20 over 5 plus 4 over 5. Let me move over a little bit so I don't run out of space. Plus 4 over 5, which is the same thing. This is 4. So this is 4 and 4 fifths. So that's one way to think about it. The other way you could think of this as 4 fifths times 6, which is the same thing as 4 fifths plus 4 fifths. I think you get the idea. Plus 4 fifths plus 4 fifths plus 4 fifths. So we took literally 6 4 fifths and added them together. And what's this going to be equal to? Well, it's going to be 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 over 5. This is how many fifths we have. Well, this is 6 times 4. Or you could say 4 times 6 over 5, which is equal to 24 over 5, which we've already figured out is 4 and 4 fifths. So either way, we're going to drink 4 and 4 fifths gallons per month. Now let's try to answer the actual question. Between what two whole numbers? Well, between 4 and 5 gallons a month. 4 and 4 fifths is right in between 4 and 5. We got it right.
