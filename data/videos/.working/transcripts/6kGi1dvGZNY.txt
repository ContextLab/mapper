Artemis seeks knowledge of the width of Orion's belt, which is a pattern of stars in the Orion constellation. She has previously discovered the distances from her house to Alnetak, 736 light years, and to Mintaka, 915 light years, which are the endpoints of Orion's belt. She knows the angle between these stars in the sky is 3 degrees. What is the width of Orion's belt? That is, what is the distance between Alnetak and Mintaka? They want us to give us an answer in light years. So let's draw a little diagram to make sure we understand what's going on. Actually, even before we do that, I encourage you to pause this and try this on your own. Now let's make a diagram. Alright, so let's say that this is Artemis's house right over here. This is Artemis's house. I'll say that's A for Artemis's house. Let me say H. Let me say this is home right over here. We have these two stars. So she's looking out into the night sky, and she sees these stars, Alnetak, which is 736 light years away. Obviously, I'm not going to draw this to scale. This is Alnetak and Mintaka. Let's say this is Mintaka right over here. We know a few things. We know that this distance between her home and Alnetak is 736 light years. So this distance right over here. That right over there, everything we'll do is in light years. That's 736. The distance between her house and Mintaka is 915 light years. It would take light 915 years to get from her house to Mintaka or from her Mintaka to her house. This is 915 light years. What we want to do is figure out the width of Orion's belt, which is the distance between Alnetak and Mintaka. We need to figure out this distance right over here. The one thing that they did give us is this angle. They did give us that angle right over there. They said the angle between these stars in the sky is 3 degrees. This is 3 degrees right over there. How can we figure out the distance between Alnetak and Mintaka? Let's just say that this is equal to x. How do we do that? If we have two sides and an angle between them, we could use the law of cosines to figure out the third side. The law of cosines, let's just apply it. The law of cosines tells us that x squared is going to be equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. It's going to be equal to 736 squared plus 915 squared minus 2 times 736 times 915 times the cosine of this angle. Once again, we're trying to find the length of the side opposite the three degrees. We know the other two sides. The law of cosines is essentially... Sorry, I just had to cough off camera because I had some peanuts in my throat. Where was I? I was saying if we know the angle and we know the two sides on either side of the angle, we can figure out the length of side opposite by the law of cosines. It essentially starts off not too different than the Pythagorean theorem, but then we give an adjustment because this is not an actual right triangle. The adjustment, we have the 736 squared plus 915 squared minus 2 times the product of these sides times the cosine of this angle. Another way we could think about it is x is equal to the square root of all of this stuff. I can just copy and paste that. Copy and paste. x is going to be equal to the square root of that. Let's get our calculator to calculate it. Let me verify that I'm in degree mode. Yes, I am indeed in degree mode. Let's exit that. I want to calculate the square root of 736 squared plus 915 squared minus 2 times 736 times 915 times cosine of 3 degrees. We deserve a drum roll now. x is 100 if we round. What do they want us to do? Round your answer to the nearest light year. The nearest light year is going to be 184 light years. x is approximately equal to 184 light years. It would take light 184 years to get from Mintaka to Alnettak. Hopefully this actually shows you it's pretty, if you are going to do any astronomy, the law of cosines, law of sines, and in fact all of trigonometry becomes quite, quite handy.
