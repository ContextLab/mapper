What I want to do in this video is give ourselves a quick overview of the different ways that cells can communicate with each other. And maybe the most basic one is just through direct contact. Direct contact, and this can happen several different ways. One way could be you just have neighboring cells. So this is one cell right over here, and this is the neighboring cell right over here. And they actually might have gaps in their membranes. If these are plant cells, we would call these gaps gap junctions. So you might have, I just drew two of them, and this is obviously just kind of a two dimensional slice. So we're not fully appreciating the three dimensional structure, but the basic idea here is maybe the cell on the left starts producing some molecules, especially some small molecules that are able to go through these gap junctions. And when they're able to go through the gap junctions, maybe they latch on to some proteins in the second cell that start maybe activating them in a certain way, or inhibit them in a certain way, or trigger some type of reaction. And so then you have a response in the second cell. So this would be a form of communication. Something happened in this first cell to produce these molecules. Those molecules were able to get into the second cell and trigger a response. And as I mentioned, if these are animal cells, we would call these gaps. We'd call them gap junctions. So that right over there, that is a gap junction. We cover this in other videos. And if we're talking about plant cells, we can have very similar things happening, but we wouldn't call them gap junctions. These would be gaps not just through the, not even tunnels through the membrane, it would also be through the cell walls. If we were talking about plants, they would be plasmodes mata. Plasmodes mata. And we talk about these more in the structure of cell videos. But there's other ways that you could communicate via direct contact. You could imagine maybe some cells that are floating around in the bloodstream. Maybe this is one cell over here. Maybe this is another cell over here. And they have complementary surface proteins. Surface proteins that are able to bind to each other. So maybe this one has a surface protein that looks like this. I'm obviously exaggerating its shape. The protein would look exactly like this inverted triangle. But this one has a surface protein like this, and I'm also exaggerating its size relative to a cell, just so we can appreciate how they could maybe lock together. So this one has a surface protein like that. And when they bind to each other, it might change the proteins in some way, and then trigger a reaction in each of these cells. That the communication then continues. If this protein changes a little bit, it might activate something, it might activate the release of some molecules, might activate some other proteins, might catalyze some type of reaction. We've seen this in multiple other videos. All sorts of crazy biological reactions could happen inside of cells. But it might elicit a, it could elicit a response. And actually it could even elicit a response in both cells, some type of response. They know that they are latched on, they know that they're latched on to someone else. Now direct contact, you could imagine, is not the only way that you could have cell-cell signaling. You could actually have cells start to signal over a little bit of a distance, by releasing molecules into the extracellular space, and eventually even into the bloodstream. So for example, let me draw a cell. A cell right over here. And maybe it's able to produce some molecules. And these molecules either, they might be lipid soluble and maybe make their way through the cellular membrane on their own, or maybe they are packed in nice vesicles that allow them to traverse the membrane. So when you get actually, so the membrane of the vesicle merges with the membrane of the cell. And then it allows these things to get out. And so you can imagine, if another cell has the right receptors for these, that would signal some type of a response, or it will form some form of communication. So let's say that I have, actually let me draw a couple of cells. So let's say I have this cell over here, and then I have this cell over here. And let's say that this cell has the right receptor, and this cell doesn't. It could have other receptors, maybe it has receptors like that, but it's not the right receptor. And so these molecules that were released by this first cell could bind, not on this character, not on this protein, the surface protein, but it could bind on this character. So it could bind on this character. And when it does so, this protein that's on the cellular membrane, it might change its shape, it might do all sorts of things, but that signal can be then taken, somehow it can continue on into the cell, and once again, you might elicit some type of response. And we'll go into more detail in future videos on exactly how that happens, or what these responses actually might be. Now, if this is over a short distance, if this is a short distance, short, if this is a short distance, short distance, we would call this paracrine. This would be part of the paracrine system, or we would call this paracrine communication. Let me write that down. Paracrine, paracrine system, or paracrine communication or paracrine signaling, and we would call these paracrine factors. But if it was happening over long distances, say maybe these molecules, they enter into the bloodstream, so they make their way into the bloodstream right over here. Let me depict somehow that this is the bloodstream. This is the bloodstream, and they're able to go through the bloodstream over longer distances to other molecules. So maybe this one has the right receptors for those molecules. Then we call this endocrine system, or this is endocrine signaling. So long distances, we would call this the endocrine system, or endocrine signaling. We're talking about the endocrine system and endocrine signaling, these molecules, which could just be all sorts of different types of molecules. They could be steroids, they could be proteins of some kind. We call, in this case, we would call them hormones. You've probably heard the word before, and we will do a whole series of videos on hormones. But these molecules actually can even affect the cell that produced them. For example, the cell that produced it might have the right receptor. So if it's able to trigger a reaction in itself, so if these things are able to trigger a reaction in itself, we would call that an autocrine process. Autocrine, it is acting on itself. Just so you're familiar with some of the terminology, these proteins on the surface, and this would be the case especially if you have non-lipid, soluble types of signaling factors or molecules right over here. These proteins, well, actually even if they're on the surface or even if they're within the cell, we would call them receptors. So that right over there, that is a receptor. Re-ceptor. And the molecules themselves, these things that bind on to the receptor, we call them the ligand. Ligand in general is a general term for something that binds on to a receptor. And so at that point where you bind on to a receptor, whether you're talking about the paracrine process or endocrine, endo, actually endo, I love to see out here, endocrine signaling, this process where it kind of starts to, where it latches on, we would call that a signal perception. And then when this protein, you know, somehow changes its shape or starts catalyzing a reaction or inhibiting a reaction, we would call this the signal transduction. It's bringing the signal into the cell, and then you have your actual cellular response. So hopefully you appreciate that. It's just a bit of an overview of how cells can signal with each other. And in future videos, we'll go into a little bit more detail, especially the endocrine system and our understanding of hormones.
