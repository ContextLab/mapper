If this page was folded along the dotted line in the figure above, the left hand of the letter W would exactly coincide with the right half of W. You see that right over there. If you fold it, this point would go to that point right over here, this point would go to that point right over there, that point would go to that point right over there, and I could keep going. You have this axis of symmetry right over here, right down the center. Which of the following letters, as shown, cannot be folded along a vertical line, so that its left half would coincide with its right half? So I encourage you to pause the video and think about this on your own. Well, let's just think about each of these. If I were to drop a vertical line down the center of A, it looks like A is symmetric about that. There are mirror images on the left and the right hand side. Same thing for the letter I, same thing for the letter O, mirror images on the two sides, same thing for the letter U. Now, E, E gets interesting. Here we don't have a mirror image. If I were to take the mirror image of this point right over here, we would get to this point right over there. If I were to take the mirror image of that point right over there, well that does get you there, but this point over here, there's no corresponding point on the other side here. If I were to go here, there's no corresponding point right over there. So in order for E to have been symmetric, it should have either looked like this, it would have either needed to look like this, or if I were to drop a line of a vertical line here, this would be symmetric, or if it looked like this. But obviously, this is not what the letter E looks like. It does not look like either of these symbols. It looks like this. And this one does not have a line of symmetry down its center axis. Or a vertical line cannot be drawn down its center to have a line of symmetry here. So this is the one that cannot be folded along a vertical line. So its left half would coincide with its right half.
