Let's figure out what 5 over 6, 5, 6 minus 2, 6 is. Minus 2, 6. So one way to do is to visualize this. This is 5, 6. You could imagine 5, 6 of a pi or 5, 6 of a bar. So let's take a bar right over here. Let's divide it into 6. So this is dividing it into half. And then each of these will divide it into 3. So this is 3, 4, 5, 6. Let me make it a little bit more even. So I've divided this bar into 6 chunks. 5, 6 would be 5 of these. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That's 5, 6. From that, we're going to subtract 2, 6. So we're going to get rid of this one right over here. And we're going to get rid of this one right over here. We're going to get rid of two of them. And so what are we left with? 3 of the 6. So we are left with 3 of the 6. And another way to think about it is our denominator stayed the same. We actually have to have the same denominator add or subtract fractions. And then we subtracted the numerators. 5, 6 minus 2, 6. 5 minus 2 is 3. And then this can actually be simplified. 3 over 6 is exactly half of the pieces. And we can see that by dividing the numerator and the denominator by 3, since they both are divisible by 3. So this becomes 1. And this becomes 2. We have half of the pieces left.
