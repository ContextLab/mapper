In the last video, we had Pete starting an open-ended mutual fund that was managed by Pete Inc. Mutual funds normally have nice, grand names. Maybe they call this the Saturn fund. If there is a Saturn fund out there, I just picked that name at random. I'm not implying that this is you or anything like that. Or something like the Galileo fund or anything like that. Who knows? I'm sure there probably is a Galileo fund. Once again, don't sue me. I just made up that name on the fly. It's managed by Pete Inc. We called it an open-ended fund because at any time, one of the people who own a share or a unit in the fund can redeem it back from the fund. Pete or the management company would say, okay, if you want at the end of that video, you're $180 back. We'll give you $180. You give back the share. Then we cancel the share. If anyone wants to add to the fund, if they want to invest, the corporation can create new shares and then issue it to people and sell it to people and then that there money will go into the common pool and the management company would take fees off of it. But that probably had you asking, well, if this is an open-ended fund, what is a closed-end fund? Or do they even exist? And they do. That's what I'm going to talk about here. Closed-end funds. Closed-end funds on some level are a little bit simpler. What happens in a closed-end fund is that all of the investors are essentially, or I guess you could say the share structure is locked in right from the beginning. So if Pete wanted to start a closed-end mutual fund, he would once again register a corporation with the SEC. He would market it. He would tell everyone, hey, I'm Pete. I'm an awesome investor. Here's my track record. And then he would just get a bunch of investors. So let's say he's able to find 20 investors and that's all he's able to find. So this is 20 right here. I'm not going to count. But let's say there's 20 slices right over here. He gets 20 people. So let's say they each give $100. So he is able to raise $2,000. So 20 times 100. So he is able to raise $2,000. And once that happens, the fund is closed. Pete's going to do his best to manage this. So Pete will manage this and he will still take a management fee, maybe the same 1%. But what's fundamentally different here, and he can mark, well, he doesn't have to market the fund anymore because he can no longer get new investors. And this is actually the main difference. An open-ended mutual fund at any point in time, or I should say at the end of trading, at the end of a day, they can lose investors or they can gain investors. So it's an incentive for an open-ended fund to constantly market itself because the manager wants to manage more money so that he gets more of a management fee. In a closed-end fund, they'll market it right when they're creating the fund. But once they create it, so let's say over here he just got his 20 investors, then it is closed. He can't create any more shares or cancel any more shares. But what can happen, so you might say, well, in the closed-end fund, how do these people, let's say that you're holding one of these shares. Let's say you're holding one share right over here. What happens if you need to buy a house or, I don't know, you owe money to somebody, so you want to get the value of your share back? And the answer with a closed-end fund is that you would then go sell your share to someone else. So this right here, you can trade it. You can trade it. And you would trade it just like you would trade the stock of any company. In fact, when you go and buy or sell a share of IBM, most of the time you're just buying or selling it from someone else. You're not transacting with IBM, the company. You trade it in the secondary market. You're not dealing with the actual corporation. And so that's where the investor gets their liquidity. And when we say liquidity, it allows them to convert it into cash because they can trade it. So the big difference, open-ended fund, when an investor wants their money back, they have to deal with the fund itself. The fund will buy back their share. If someone wants to invest in a fund, the fund will sell them the share. So they're always dealing with the fund itself. In a closed-end fund, once the fund is created, its share pool is fixed. And if someone wants to buy or sell a share, it happens in the secondary markets. They're buying and selling from each other. They're not dealing with the actual fund manager. The disadvantage from the fund manager here is it's much less flexible in terms of growing or shrinking the fund. The advantage is this fund manager doesn't have to keep cash around in case the shareholders want to redeem. In the open-ended fund, we saw that the manager has to keep some cash around in case one of the investors wants their money back. Here, the closed-end fund, he knows that no one can get their money back right here so he or she can invest as they see fit.
