Let's simplify some of these expressions. So this first one is 7 times the quantity s plus 9 plus 2s. So we can distribute the 7, because 7 is times the entire quantity s plus 9. So we want to distribute the 7. So it becomes 7 times s, which is 7s, plus 7 times 9, which is 63. And so that's this part right over here. And then we have the plus 2s. Well, if I have 7s's, and I'm going to add another 2s's to them, I'm going to have 9s's. So you add those two parts. You get 9s. And then you still have your plus 63. Let's do this one over here. Negative 4 minus the quantity q minus 10 plus 5. So what I'm going to do here, so we can get rid of these parentheses, is distribute the negative sign. This is essentially multiplying both of these terms times negative 1. You could view that there's a negative 1 out here. Then this part right over here becomes negative 1 times q, so it's negative q. And negative 1 times negative 10 is positive 10 plus 10. So that's that part right over there. And we still have this negative 4 out front and this plus 5 afterwards. So what can we do over here? So we can add all the non-q. The only q term here is this, negative q. So I'll just rewrite it over here, negative q. And then we have all of our constant terms. We have negative 4 plus 10 plus 5. So negative 4 plus 10 is 6 plus 5 is 11. Plus 11. Negative q plus, and the rest of this adds up to 11. Let's do this one. So we have negative 7 times the quantity i plus 2. So we can distribute the negative 7. So this is going to be equal to negative 7 times i, which is negative 7i, plus negative 7 times 2, which is negative 14. Or we could write plus negative 14, or we could just write minus 14. So that's this part right over here. And then we have negative 2, so this is a negative 2, times the quantity 2 plus i. So that's times 2, and then that's times i. So negative 2 times 2 is negative 4. So it's negative 4. Negative 2 times positive i is negative 2i. And now we can add the i terms. We have negative 7i, and we have negative 2i. Negative 7i minus 2i is negative 9i. And then negative 14 minus 4, those are our constant terms. That gives us negative 18. Negative 14 minus 4 is negative 18. And we are done.
