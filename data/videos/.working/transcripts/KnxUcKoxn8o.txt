Welcome teachers to the unit on insurance. And insurance is one of those things that a lot of people sometimes don't even associate with financial literacy, even though it is something that you put money out for, you pay for, and it's to protect you, usually financially, from a lot of downside, from a lot of bad things happening. So that's why this is a pretty important unit. And it starts with helping the students understand the notion of risk. It's easy to imagine that the world will just continue as it is now, especially when you're young, but it's good to be aware that sometimes we can get unlucky, bad things can happen, and we need to be able to manage these types of risks. And that there are financial instruments to help us manage those risks. And insurance is the most well-known type of financial instrument that allows us to do that. But to do that, you have to understand terminology, things like deductibles, things like premiums, and that's what this lesson here on basics and terminology will cover. And then the different options for health insurance, which is a very important type of insurance, which young people sometimes don't think about if they're feeling very healthy, but it's very important, especially later in life, but actually, I would say, even when they're young, and maybe they're thinking about other people and their family, and then other types of insurance, especially life insurance is one that, I didn't start thinking about until I had a family, but it's good to know about it. Young people should know about whether their parents have life insurance or other people in their family, and it is something that they should just understand, maybe to advise adults or once they become adults themselves, and then all of the other types of insurance. And it's not just protecting your downside, but it's also understanding that when you say, own property or own a car, that there are costs involved from the insurance to help protect against risk that a lot of students might not actually think about. So there's several other things here, and these actually do get into a level of depth that I think these students will be able to teach their parents a thing or two, which is always valuable. And like always, I encourage you as a teacher, try to do at least all of the exercises, but it's great if you can read the articles, watch the videos, and bring some stories of your own without divulging too much personal information to your students, because I think that's what will really make it stick for them.
