Khanmigo has many exciting features that support teachers, and this video will showcase ways that you can use Khanmigo to create core-specific content to enhance the learning experience for all of your students. Throughout this video, we'll explore ways Khanmigo can assist elementary school teachers with creating unique and engaging lesson plans and student-centered activities that get students excited about learning while saving you time. Ready to see the teaching assistant you've always wanted? Let's take a look! This is Khanmigo's dashboard, your hub of unique, powerful features, masterfully designed precision to enhance your teaching experience and maximize your time so you can spend it where it's most important with your students. Let's begin our exploration with the learning objective feature. It's critical for teachers to have a learning objective before teaching because it shapes the lesson's path and makes students' expectations clear. Now, let's put it into action. To use the learning objective tool, Khanmigo just needs to know what grade level you teach and what your topic is. We are about to start a unit on multiplying fractions. Khanmigo, please help me write a learning objective! And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo creates a learning objective that I can use to help guide the rest of my lesson. Now that we have our learning objective, let's move on to the lesson hook because, let's face it, it's not just about teaching. It's about creating memorable, engaging experiences that enhance student understanding and retention. Empowered by Khanmigo, teachers will be able to design captivating lesson introductions that ignite student curiosity and spark a thirst for knowledge. Once I open the lesson hook tool, all I have to do is let Khanmigo know the grade level and the lesson topic. Multiplying fractions. Khanmigo will do the rest! And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo creates three fantastic lesson hooks that will be sure to spark my students' curiosity and increase their engagement. This is a great way to make learning exciting, right from the start! Ignited by my students' curiosity, I'm now excited and ready to create an amazing lesson plan! Khanmigo's lesson plan feature will quickly assist me in crafting a plan that aligns with my curriculum and meets the needs of my students. When I select the lesson plan button, Khanmigo prompts me to specify the topic I'm planning to teach. It then offers a variety of topics from Khan Academy's extensive course list. If my topic isn't included, Khanmigo gives me the option to add my own. I do see my lesson on here, so I'm going to select this one. Promptly, Khanmigo generates a thorough lesson plan that aligns with my curriculum. The plan includes learning objectives, learning activities such as warm-ups, direct instruction, independent practice, exit ticket questions, assessments, and so much more to ensure a well-rounded learning experience for my class. Plus, these lesson plans are fully customizable. I can easily alter any section to better suit the needs of my students, whether it's the objective, the activities, or this warm-up activity. All I have to do is click on it, Khanmigo will appear, and Khanmigo wants to know if I want to make changes to it, if I want to try something different, or I could discuss it with Khanmigo because we're co-creating this together. I think I just want to try something different. And as soon as I select the button, Khanmigo quickly creates a new warm-up activity for my students. I like this one much better. Now that my lesson plan is exactly the way I want it, I have a few options. I can print the lesson, or I can easily export it to a Word document, a PDF, or save it to my Google Drive. This has saved me so much time. Thank you so much, Khanmigo. As an educator, I understand the value of exposing students to grade-level text and vocabulary. However, balancing this with comprehension is crucial to the overall learning experience for students. The Leveler feature, one of my new favorite tools, adjusts text complexity to match students' reading levels, ensuring understanding while engaging with grade-level material and personalized instruction to each student's needs. Once I select the Leveler feature, I just have to let Khanmigo know the title of the text, and then copy and paste the original text in the space provided. The next unit in my science class is over the life cycle of a butterfly. I'm a fifth grade teacher, however, I do have a few students who are currently reading on a second grade level, so I'm going to adjust this text for them. And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo creates the same text but on a second grade reading level for my students, so that all of my students can understand the life cycle of a butterfly. The next feature that I'd like to explore is the Chunk Text feature. This incredible tool allows me to transform complex text into bite-sized pieces, which is perfect for young learners. This tool will enhance comprehension, boost confidence, and foster a love of reading with my students. When I select the Chunk Text feature, I input the title and the text, and then I just let Khanmigo the type of chunks that I want. Do I want to chunk a longer text by ideas for comprehension, or chunk a shorter text by phrases for fluency? I really want my students working on fluency this week, so I'm going to select this one. And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo transforms the text into smaller chunks, which helps with comprehension and makes reading less intimidating for young learners. It's a great way to build confidence and reading skills. As an educator, I aim to craft thought-provoking discussion prompts tailored to specific topics for my students. My goal is to ignite their curiosity and stimulate intellectual discourse, so I'm going to use the Discussion Prompt feature. I just have to let Khanmigo know the grade level and the topic. We're about to work on the American Revolution in my history class. And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo creates multiple detailed and thought-provoking discussion questions that'll be sure to get my students chatting, but in a good way. The Newsletter Tool is a communication powerhouse for elementary teachers. The Newsletter Tool allows teachers to create custom newsletters. You can add updates, photos, reminders, and so much more. Once created, it can easily be shared with parents via email or print. It's a simple, effective way to keep parents in the loop about their child's education. When I open the Class Newsletter feature, I just have to let Khanmigo know the name of my class, what we did last week, what we're doing next week, and any other information that I'd like to include. Khanmigo will do the rest. Once my newsletter is created, it can easily be shared with parents via email or print. It's a simple, effective way to keep parents in the loop about their child's education. Thanks, Khanmigo! Another one of my new favorite tools is the IEP Assistant, which helps teachers craft individualized education plans for students. It guides teachers through the entire process, helping identify student needs, setting achievable goals, and planning appropriate supports. Upon opening the IEP Assistant, Khanmigo asks important questions about your student, such as the learning environment, the disability category, the current challenges the student has, current strengths the student has. Then, once you fill in all of those categories, you can draft an accommodation plan in a matter of seconds. And in no time at all, Khanmigo creates a customized, detailed, individualized education plan for your student that includes accommodation suggestions, smart goals, and so much more. The IEP Assistant is truly a game changer when creating individualized education plans, ensuring that every one of your students gets the support that they need. If you're looking for a fun, engaging way to learn for your students, you have to try our fun class summary poem feature. It's a unique, rhythmic way to summarize lessons for your students. Let's give it a try! When I select the button, Khanmigo wants me to ask my students what they learned today. They all shout out, quadrilaterals, and I'm so excited that they remembered that name. Then, Khanmigo wants me to ask them for a fun word that will inspire our poem. One student shouts out, Fluffy. I think they must have gotten a new cat. Then, Khanmigo will do the rest. And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo creates our fun class poem. Quadrilaterals, oh so fluffy. Four sides, none too stuffy. Rectangles, squares, and the trapezoid. In geometry, they're hard to avoid. rhombus, kite, parallelogram. All part of the quadrilateral fam. So remember, don't be in a huff. Quadrilaterals are fluffy, not tough. As you can see, it's not just a poem. It's a memory booster, a creativity enhancer, and a super cool learning tool that your students will love. Thanks, Khanmigo.
