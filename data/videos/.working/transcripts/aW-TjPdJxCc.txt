Let's say I start a money market mutual fund, and I initially capitalize it with $9 million. So I have $9 million of assets right now, and it's cash right when I start it off. And I'm also going to have, and this tends to be the case for money market mutual funds, is I will create 9 million shares, or 9 million units. So I will divide this up into 9 million shares. So right from the get go, my net asset value. So my asset value is 9 million. I have no liabilities to subtract from that. So my net asset value is going to be the same as my asset value. And so my net asset value per share, my NAV per share, is going to be $9 million over 9 million shares, or $1 per share. And I'm going to take this money, and I'm going to invest it in T-bills, and commercial paper, and CDs, things that are very liquid, short term, and very, very, very safe. And as interest comes in on those assets from the government, or from the corporations, or wherever I'm getting that from, I pay them as dividends to the owners of these units, or the owners of the shares. So they get dividends. And so it doesn't automatically, although you could set it up so it automatically does it. But in general, it won't go right back into the asset pool. So it'll just stay at $1. My NAV per share will just stay at $1. Now this is the case of almost all money market funds, almost all of the time. But every now and then, something really wild might happen. So they might invest in super safe things, like T-bills, or commercial paper. Commercial paper, short term loans to very safe companies, commercial paper. And something really wild might happen, like it looks like the United States government, in its history, all of a sudden, for the first time ever might default on its debt. Or maybe it actually does default on its debt. And if something like that were to happen, then this thing that people thought was as good as cash, all of a sudden might go down in value. Or you might have a financial crisis, where for whatever reason, people are dumping commercial paper. No one wants to hold it anymore. And so this value might go down. So it's only happened very, very, very, very few times. And even then it wasn't a dramatic move. You could imagine a world where the actual NAV per share goes below this $1. And when that happens, that's called breaking the buck. Breaking the buck. And most mutual fund companies that run a money market fund like this, even if something disastrous like this happened, and this fund goes from $1 NAV per share to $0.93, or $0.95 NAV per share, it's such a bad signal to customers that this thing that you are marketing is essentially as good as cash, as good as a savings account, is all of a sudden something that someone might lose money on. And this is why there's been so few times in history where investors actually lost money on money market funds, is even if these things do lose value, the parent company of the money market fund usually makes them whole. They usually say, look, it might cost us a little bit money to make this share or make this fund whole, but that's less than the harm to our actual reputation. But once again, I want to emphasize this has happened very, very, very few times in history.
