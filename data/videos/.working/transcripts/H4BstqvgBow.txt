Let's see if we can get some experience converting from a decimal representation to a binary. And let's start with a fairly straightforward example, with a fairly low number. Let's see if we can convert the number 13 in decimal to binary, and I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it out on your own. So I'm assuming you've had a go at it. So the key here is to see if you can deconstruct the number 13 as the sum of powers of two, and then it becomes very straightforward to represent it in binary, because in binary, you're essentially saying, well, what powers of two do you need to make up this number? So let's just write the powers of two here, just to remind ourselves. And I'll go until we go right above 13. So 2 to the 0 is equal to 1. 2 to the first is equal to 2. 2 squared is equal to 4. 2 to the third is equal to 8. 2 to the fourth is equal to 16, and I'm above 13. So I'm definitely, I have all the powers of two that I need to construct 13. So what's the largest power of two that is less than or equal to 13? Well, 16's too large. Well, it would be 8. So I could rewrite 13 as 8 plus 5. Now, 5 is not a power of two, so I have to keep deconstructing that. What's the largest power of two that is less than or equal to 5? We see it right over here. It's 4, so let me rewrite that. It's 8 plus, instead of writing 5, I'll write 4 plus 1. And then the good thing is, 1 as a power of two, we already see the largest power of two that's less than or equal to it is 1. This already is a power of two. So I've now rewritten this as the sum of powers of, the sum of powers of two. Notice this is 2 to the third, whoops. This is 2 to the third power. This is 2 squared. And this is 2 to the zero power. Or I could write it like this. I have 1, 8. I have 1, 8 clearly. I have 1, 4. 1, 4. Or and, I should say and, and I have 1, 1. So I could add these two. I could add these three together. 13 could be considered 1, 8 plus 1, 4 plus 1, 1. Well, why is that helpful? Well, now let's just, let's go, let's go into binary mode and think about what each of the place values represent. So this is the ones place. That's the ones place. And then we could go to the twos place. Twos place. Every time we go to the left, each place we multiply by two. It's the next power of two. Then we go to the fours place. Fours place. And then we go to the eights place. Eights place. Eights. And in binary I only have two digits, zero or one. So I either have zero of a place or I have one of it. So let's go through it. How many ones do I have? Well, I have one one. So I'll write that there. How many twos do I have? Well, in this representation I don't have any twos. I have an eight, I have a four and a one. So I'm gonna put, I have zero twos. How many fours do I have? Well, I have one four. One four. And how many eights do I have? Well, I have one eight. So 13, the decimal represent, the 13 written in decimal or 13 which is a decimal number, if I were to write it in binary, is one one zero one.
