- [David] Wordsmiths, greetings! You've found yourself in a
place unlike other places, a place of learning, a place of language, a place we call the vocabulary zone. Here the unclear becomes clear, new words become familiar words, and you become a vocabulary expert. We're gonna look at three words today: foundation, reinforce, and maximum. I'll define the words,
we'll break down the words, and then at the very end, we'll use those words in some sentences. Let's begin. Foundation. It's a noun. It means a layer that forms
the base of a building or a structure, or a factor or idea on
which something is based. So a house sits on a foundation, right? A slab of rock or stone or concrete. So the house can sit right and not sink into the Earth,
as a literal foundation. But to use it in that
second sense, figuratively, we can say our business rests
on a foundation of trust or something like that. And as we all know, trust isn't rocks. I'm very smart. Reinforce is a verb, and it means to strengthen
something by adding to it. To go back to concrete from
the foundation example, lots of concrete buildings
have steel rods in them. Maybe you've seen this when you've walked by a construction site. This is called rebar or a reinforcing bar. You pour the concrete
around the reinforcing bar to make the concrete stronger. And finally, maximum. This is both a noun and an adjective, that means the most or the
highest or greatest amount. Let's break these words down. Foundation comes from found or
fund, meaning base or bottom, and T-I-O-N, which is
a noun-forming suffix. So it's the thing that makes up the bottom of something else. If you are the founder of something, you were there at the beginning. You built the first layer, and maybe you understand the most basic important aspects of your
field, the fundamentals. Reinforce comes from re,
in, and the root fort. Re meaning again or more, in meaning in, and fort from the Latin
fortis, meaning strength. You've seen this root
in force and forceful, but other words that use that fort root are things like effort, comfort, fortress, doing things out of strength,
sharing strength with others. A big, strong castle, right? Maximum is just straight up a Latin word. It means the greatest or the most. It comes from the adjective
magnus, meaning big. So our root for this is
actually magn, M-A-G-N. And while max is a relatively
uncommon word part in English, we have the proper name Max
from Maximus or Maximilian, there are a lot of
words with magn in them. Magnify, like a magnifying
glass, makes things bigger. Magnificent, meaning wonderful,
capable of big things. Or magnitude, meaning bigness, largeness. Let's use these words in some sentences. "Welp," the engineer said,
"The foundation is crumbling. I don't expect this building to stay upright longer than a year." This is the literal use of foundation. So it's the base that
the building sits on. When I learned we were sailing
through squid territory, I reinforced our sailboat
with steel plating, right? I strengthened it. I added steel plating to the
sailboat to make it stronger. Excuse me, the maximum
capacity of this sailboat is four persons or fewer. You'll need to get out. Unfortunately, the steel plating did not keep the squid away, but the maximum capacity,
the largest number of people that can fit on the boat, is four. So the squids gotta go, and
I too must go, Wordsmiths. Thank you for joining me on this journey to a place beyond place, to a universe beyond human comprehension to the vocabulary zone. I'll see you in the next one. You can learn anything. David, out.
