What I want to do in this video is get some practice or become familiar with what different angle measures in radians actually represent. And to get our familiarity, we're going to start with a ray that starts at the origin and moves along, and not moves, and points along the positive x-axis. So we're going to start with this magenta ray. And we're going to rotate it around the origin counterclockwise by different angle measures and think about what quadrant do we fall into if we start with this and we were to rotate by counterclockwise by 3 pi over 5 radians. And then if we start with this and we were to rotate counterclockwise by 2 pi over 7 radians, or if we were to start with this and then rotate counterclockwise by 3 radians. So I encourage you to pause the video and think about starting with this. If we were to rotate counterclockwise by each of these, what quadrant are we going to end up in? So assume you have had, you paused the video, and you tried it out on your own. So let's try this first one, 3 pi over 5. So 3 pi over 5, so we're going to start rotating. So if we go straight up, if we rotated essentially, if you want to think in degrees, if you rotated it counterclockwise 90 degrees, that is going to get us 2 pi over 2. So that would have been a rotation, a counterclockwise rotation of pi over 2 radians. Now is 3 pi over 5 greater or less than that? Well 3 pi over 5 is greater than, or I guess another way I could say it is, 3 pi over 6 is less than 3 pi over 5. You make the denominator smaller, you're making the fraction larger. So 3 pi over 6 is the same thing as pi over 2. So let me write it this way. So 3 pi over 2 is less than 3 pi over 5. So it's definitely past this. We're going to go past this. Now does that get us all the way over here? If we were to go essentially be pointed in the opposite direction, instead of being pointed to the right, making a full, I guess you could say 180 degree counterclockwise rotation, that would be pi radians. That would be pi radians. But this thing is less than pi. Pi would be 5 pi over 5. So this is less than pi radians. So we are going to sit someplace, and I'm just estimating it. We are going to sit someplace like that. And so we are going to sit in the second quadrant. Now let's think about 2 pi over 7. So 2 pi over 7, do we even get past pi over 2? Well pi over 2 here would be 3.5 pi over 7. So we don't even get to pi over 2. We're going to end up someplace over here. This thing is greater than 0, so we're going to definitely start moving counterclockwise. But this thing is less than pi over 2. So this is going to throw us in the first quadrant. Now what about 3 radians? So one way to think about it is 3 is a little bit less than pi. 3 is less than pi, but it's greater than pi over 2. How do we know that? Well pi is approximately 3.14159, and it just keeps going on and on and on forever. So 3 is definitely closer to that than it is to half of that. So it's going to be between pi over 2 and pi. So it's going to be, if we start with the magenta ray, and we rotate counterclockwise by 3 radians, we are going to get, actually it's probably going to look something, it's going to be something like this. But for the sake of this exercise, we have gotten ourselves, once again, into the second quadrant.
