This is Sal and I'm here again with my good friend Dr. Mahadevan from Stanford Medical School. And what are we looking at? This is mildly disturbing. Yeah, what we're looking at here is a picture of the scene of an auto rickshaw accident in India. And what you can see is a bashed up auto rickshaw, which is a form of transportation like a taxi in India. And likely the driver there on the ground being attended to by an emergency medical technician. Did you take this picture? No, this was taken by one of the emergency medical technicians or EMTs on an ambulance in India to sort of show the impact of the scene. Wow, wow. And why are we looking at this picture? We're looking at this picture to demonstrate or to talk about the importance of trauma as a health issue across the globe and how we need to pay more attention to it. And trauma is a word that has an everyday language. How do you all refer to trauma? Is it a technical term? Trauma, when we talk about trauma, we're talking about injuries specifically, car accidents, stabbings, gunshot wounds, falls. Those are the things that when we talk about trauma, what we're relating to. I see. And this is what the emergency room is all about. Exactly. One of our roles is to provide care to the victims of trauma. Usually we try to get to them early on so that we can affect their outcomes. And so when ambulances come from accident scenes, they are bringing patients usually who are victims of trauma. I see. I see. And we have a slide down here. What is this about? This shows a map of the world. And what we can see here is if green is good. So if you live in a place like the United States or Europe, Australia or China, where it's green, that means your chance of dying from trauma or from an injury is much less than the areas that are orange, like Africa and the Indians of Ghana. Well, one thing that I mean, when you just said China, I'm impressed is actually in that bucket. Because they're not always considered fully developed. They're kind of on their rapid growth too. But they are pretty good from a trauma point of view. From this particular study and this graph, Japan and China are doing comparably to the United States. Yeah. Japan, I would expect. I mean, Japan, but China, that's good. I mean, I wouldn't doubt they were already kind of first world status in terms of trauma. You did see the Olympics? No, I know they're first world on many things, but that's good. That speaks well of the Chinese. And sorry I interrupted you. No, no. And so what we really are trying to focus on is green is great and they're doing fine. And what we're really trying to focus on are the areas that are orange, like most of the African subcontinent, India and the Indian subcontinent. And surprisingly, most of Russia is red, which has the highest mortality in all the former Soviet Union. So that is, I mean, this is perplexing because I would have guessed if you had asked me before looking at this, that China and the Soviet Union would have been comparable. Or not Soviet Union, Russia now, would have been comparable, but they're at opposite. And it's worse than Africa. Yeah, surprising to me as well. And do we know why? I really don't know why. Probably what we're going to talk about, which is a lack of access to emergency care. And also one of the things that's really worked in our favor and advantage in this country is the use of safety devices and just the kinds of safety tools we have on our highway system and roads. Wow. Wow. OK. Well, fascinating. Fascinating. And so this is what we this is what you're kind of one of your missions in life is, is to address this issue that's on the slide right here, this disparity. Absolutely. Our goal is really to see the entire globe look green as opposed to just certain parts of it. And so what we're hoping to do is take the knowledge that we've gained, the systems that we've developed in the green countries and bring them to the red and orange and yellow countries to try to decrease the number of deaths. Right. For cases like that auto rickshaw accident that we just we just saw. And hopefully that guy turned out turned out well. Absolutely. For him. So we have some other stuff down here. What is what is this telling us? This really shows us that that the people that die from from trauma from injury are people like you and I can I can still say you and I because I'm only 44. And that fits in that. Yes. That group there. But if you're under the age of 44, you have the highest likelihood of dying from trauma as opposed to right here. So this let me let me make sure I can digest this is age distribution of global health. It's age distribution of global injury related mortality. So that's death. Exactly. We're talking about this is in the year 2000 and right. This is one of the biggest buckets 15 to 29 and then 30 to 44. That's because we're writing our auto auto rickshaws more. Writing motorcycles without helmets or riding in our cars. Talking on our cell phone or without our seatbelts. Absolutely. This is global. This includes even the US in this data. This is global. It's everybody. Right. Right. Right. Mortality. This is number of deaths percentage of total. OK. So if someone if you know someone died due to injury related there's a 25 percent chance that they were or a little less than that that they were probably in this age group and then another 25 roughly percent chance that they were in this age group. That's right. So over half of the patients are roughly half the patients between the ages of 15 and 44 which are the young productive patients that are contributing to society. Right. Right. Fascinating. Fascinating. I wear my helmet. Very good. OK. And what is this is this is fascinating. What is this telling us. This is a very famous diagram that looks at the trimodal distribution of death and basically what it shows is right after a severe accident or trauma. You have a 50 percent likelihood of dying and that's usually from some kind of devastating injuries some devastating head injury or or aortic injury that is not survivable. So these people usually die within. Either instantly or within the first few minutes after a trauma. And that's so this is like on this axis someone. This is where the injury occurred. Exactly. And then we're moving forward in time right over here. Exactly. Moving forward in time. And this is what you're talking about this 50 percent. This 50 percent is these are people. It's a major injury. And even in a modern health care system it might be difficult. You might not even get to them in time because this is in minutes. Exactly. Exactly. So this this is some devastating injury. Like you said somebody was not wearing their helmet and realistically we're not going to be able to get to them in time. And it's doubtful that we could do anything for these. Right. Whether you're in the first world or the developing world. Exactly. And so our focus here would be on prevention. Right. Right. Right. Obviously. Right. Right. And then what are these other these other groups. The next sort of distribution of death is this 30 percent group which is in for minutes to hours. And these are the patients that we're really trying to get at. These are the patients and we use a term called the golden hour which is that first hour after injury. If we can get to those patients and get them to skilled health care both in the field and at the hospital we can affect their outcomes. And when I say that what I mean is we can save their lives potentially. Right. And this is where it becomes really relevant in this idea of kind of global health. These people are getting saved for the most part they're getting saved in the developed world where we have good kind of emergency response systems and things like that. And then the doctors are trained in emergency medicine but in a lot of the parts of the world they don't have a good ambulance system or 911 system and then even when they get to a hospital they might not have a proper emergency room. Absolutely true. And what's the staggering statistic is if you look at that group of patients that those 30 percent in a developed world their chance of dying is about 6 percent in the undeveloped world or developing world their chance of dying is six times higher. It's 36 percent. Wow. Wow. OK. Yeah. So that's a major. So same injuries. Yes. Different location different country different outcome for the. And your sense is there's some basic things that they can do to get this 36 percent a lot closer to the 6 percent. Exactly. It's exactly the things that you alluded to development of an emergency medical services or an ambulance system that can take the patients to the hospital. Education development of education development of systems trauma systems that we have here in the US and other parts of the world incorporating those into the way they care for those patients can can reduce that number from 36 percent. All right. Down to some in terms of absolute numbers. I mean we're talking about if if if the developing world were down to single digits we're talking about thousands or maybe millions. I mean we're talking about thousands of people every day every day. Thousands of people not thousands of these young people in this distribution right over here. These people are probably supporting their families. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it just it's just a matter of the things that we alluded to. Thousands every day. Thousands every day. Wow. And what's this last this last group right over here. This last group is a group that typically dies days or weeks later in the intensive care setting. And these patients usually die from overwhelming sepsis like an infection or like a bacterial infection in the blood and overwhelming better than last week. Or something like multi organ failure. So all of their organs start to shut down. And again. So this is really the sweet spot where you want to focus your your emergency medicine because this this is you know this is not dependent on the EMS system and basic processes and things like that. But this is stuff that you can really really start to exactly exactly. Well it really is important. And just one more one more fact as time progresses right now the number one killer of people in the world is cardiovascular disease. In 2020 just nine years from now trauma will be the number two killer worldwide of all patients. 2020 it'll be trauma. It'll be you said number number two number two right after right after cardiovascular disease. And we know right now on a daily basis 16000 people die every day from trauma around the world. 16000 people and that's that's based on the trend that we are on right now if we get this number down to 6% maybe it might not be number two hopefully. That's our goal. That's that's the goal. That's the goal. Wow. Wow. That's mind boggling.
