Find the probability of rolling doubles on two six-sided dice, so these are just the regular types of dice that you're used to playing with Monopoly or any kind of typical board game, numbered from one to six. So rolling doubles, so doubles would be getting maybe two ones or maybe getting two threes, getting the same number showing up on the top of both of the dice. So that's what we would figure out the probability of. So to do that, let's think about all of the possible outcomes. So let's think about the sample space over here. So let's say we have the first die. I'll do in this column. So here are the outcomes for the first die. You can have a one, a two, a three, a four, a five, or a six. And then let's say for the second die, I'll do in this right over here, I'll have the columns labeled the roll on the second die. You could get a one, a two, a three, a four, a five, or a six. So for example, I could get a one with the first die and a one with the second die. And actually, that meets our constraints, but we won't go there just yet. So this is one member of our sample space, getting a one in this first die and a one on the second die. And I want to be clear, these are independent events. The second die does not know what happened for the other die and vice versa. They're just going to each roll independently of each other. So these are independent events. They don't affect each other. And so these are all the situations where I roll one on the first die. These are all situations where I roll one on the first die. And then the second die, I could get a two, a three, a four, a five, or a six. And let me put commas here. That's not 11. So that's one and a two, one and a three, one and a four, one and a five, one and a six. And so these are all situations where I roll a two on the first die. We're going to fully build out our sample space. So this is a two and a one, a two and a two, three, four, five, six. I could keep feeling it that way. Or I could say, hey, these are all the scenarios where I roll a one on the second die. So I'll have a one over here, one over here, one over here, one over here. These are all the situations where I have a two on the second die. These are all situations where I have a three on the second die, a four on the second die, a five on the second die, and a six on the second die. And then here, all situations where I have a three on the first die, three, three, three, three, and three. Almost done. These are situations with a four on the first die. So this is rolling a four and a four. This is rolling a four and a five. Four and a six. These are five on the first die, five. Almost there, one row left. And these are rolling a six on the first die. So each of these, I guess you can view them as cells. Let me draw it as an actual grid, as a chart. So let me split it up to make it a little bit neater. Hopefully it makes it a little bit neater. So let me draw some lines here. Then let me draw these to make it, you see it's a grid. So on this chart, each of these cells, each of the little boxes show a possible outcome. They are a member of our sample space. Let me just draw a couple of more lines, and then we're ready to think about this a little bit more. So each of these grids, this not so neatly drawn grid, and each of these represent an outcome when I roll two die. Three on the first die, three on the second die. Five on the first die, three on the second die. Four on the first die, five on the second die. These are all the possibilities. And you see there's 36 of them, because there's six different possibilities for the first die, and six different possibilities for the second die. Six times six is 36. Now how many of these possibilities, how many of these outcomes, how many of these simple events meet the constraints for our compound event? And a compound event is just an event that has more than one possible outcome that satisfies it. So we want to roll doubles. So how many ways can we roll doubles? Well, that's doubles right there. That's doubles right there. That's doubles right there. That's doubles right there. That's doubles right there. And that's doubles right there. That's why we call it a compound event. Rolling doubles is a compound event. Let me write this. This is a compound event. Fancy word for just saying there's more than one outcome that we could say this event has happened. A simple event would be an event that's associated with only one outcome. This event is associated with multiple outcomes. So if you want to figure out the probability of rolling doubles, the probability of, and our event here is rolling doubles, which is a compound event. It has more than one event associated with it. It has more than one outcome associated with it. This is a compound event. How many of the possible outcomes are associated with this event? So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 6 outcomes associated with this event. And then how many total possible outcomes are there? Well, we already said. There's a total of 36 possible outcomes. The size of the sample space is 36. So the probability of rolling doubles is 6. There's six different ways I can roll double out about possible 36 different ways of actually rolling the die. So it's 6, 36. And we can simplify that, because it's just a fraction. 6 over 36, they're both divisible by 6. So you can divide the numerator and the denominator by 6. That's the same thing as 1 over 6. 1 out of 6. So another way of thinking about it, I have a 1, 6 chance when I roll 2 die of coming up with doubles. Or 1, 6 of all of the possibilities of rolling 2 die, 1, 6 of them result in actually getting doubles.
