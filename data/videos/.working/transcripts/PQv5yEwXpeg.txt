We're told the system of linear equations below is graphed on the coordinate grid. So we can see the graph of y is equal to negative two x minus two in blue here, and then y is equal to negative 1 4th x plus five in brown here. And what I want you to first do before I do it with you is see if you can visually think about what the solution is to the system. So an x and y pair that satisfy both of these equations. And then I want you to verify that it is indeed the solution. All right, now when I visually inspect it, it looks like this point right over here is on both lines. And if I eyeball it, that looks like the point x is equal to negative four, and y is equal to six. So negative four, six. But let's verify that that indeed is a point on both of these lines. And to do that, let's see what y is equal to in each of these when x is equal to negative four. So in that first one, and maybe I'll do it in that same color, just to make, or a close color. So if I say y is equal to negative two times negative four minus two, that's equal to positive eight minus two, which is indeed equal to six. So for this blue line, when x is equal to negative four, y is indeed equal to six. Now let's also do it for this brownish looking line. So there, y is equal to negative 1 4th, and here our x is negative four. And then we're gonna have plus five. And so here we have negative 1 4th times negative four is positive one plus five is indeed equal to six. So that point negative four comma six is indeed on both lines.
