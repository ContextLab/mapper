We already know that the derivative with respect to x of tangent of x is equal to the secant of x squared, which is of course the same thing as 1 over cosine of x squared. Now what we want to do in this video, like we've done in the last few videos, is figure out what the derivative of the inverse function of the tangent of x is. Or in particular, let's see if we can figure out what the derivative with respect to x of the inverse tangent of x is. And I encourage you to pause this video and use a technique similar to the one, or very close to the one that we've used in the last few videos, to figure out what this is. Well let's set y equal to the inverse tangent of x. y is equal to inverse tangent of x. That is the same thing as saying that the tangent of y, the tangent of y is equal to x. All I've done, you can kind of think of it as I've just taken the tangent of both sides right over here. And now we can take the derivative of both sides with respect to x. And on the left hand side we can just apply the chain rule. Derivative of tangent of y with respect to y is going to be secant squared of y, which is the same thing as one over cosine of y squared. I like to write it this way. It keeps it a little bit simpler, at least in my brain. But when we're applying the chain rule, it's going to be the derivative of tangent of y with respect to y times the derivative of y with respect to x. And on the right hand side, the derivative of x with respect to x, well that's just going to be equal to one. And so we get, if we want to solve for the derivative of y with respect to x, we just multiply both sides times the cosine of y squared. And we get the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to cosine of y squared. And like we've seen in previous videos, this isn't that satisfying, because I've written the derivative of y with respect to x as a function of y. But what we're really interested in is writing it as a function of x. And to do that, we need to express this somehow in terms of the tangent of y. And the reason why the tangent of y is interesting is because we already know that tangent of y is equal to x. So if we can rewrite this using a little bit of trigonometric identities, then with tangent of y we can substitute all the tangent of y's with an x. So let's see if we can do that. And this seems a little bit tricky. To introduce a tangent of y, we'd want to have a sine divided by a cosine, that's what tangent is. And this is just a straight up cosine squared y. So this is really going to take a little bit more experimentation than at least some of the other, than the last few examples we've done. So one thing we could do is we could say, hey, let's just divide by one. Dividing by one never hurt anyone. So we could say that this is the same thing, this is the same thing, as cosine squared y. And I'm really doing this to see if I can start to express it as some type of a rational expression, which might involve at some point a sine divided by a cosine and I could have a tangent. So let's divide by one. But we know from the Pythagorean identity that one is equal to sine squared of y plus cosine squared of y. And so let's write that, or we could write cosine squared of y plus sine squared of y. Once again, why was I able to divide by this expression? Well, this expression by the Pythagorean identity, which really comes out of the unit circle definition of trig functions, this is equal to one. So I have not changed the value of this expression. Now what makes this interesting is if I want to introduce a sine divided by a cosine, I could just divide the numerator and the denominator by cosine squared. So let's do that. Let's multiply one over cosine, or let's divide the numerator by cosine squared of y and divide the denominator by cosine squared of y, or multiply each of them by one over cosine squared of y. And what's that going to give us? Well, the numerator, these characters are going to cancel. You're just going to have a one. And in the denominator, this times this, that's just going to be equal to one. And then you're going to have sine squared, sine squared y over cosine squared y. And this is the goal that I was trying to achieve. I have a sine divided by cosine squared. So this right over here, this is the same thing. Actually, let me just write it this way. This is the same thing as sine of y over cosine of y whole thing squared, which is of course the same thing as one over one plus tangent of y squared. This is equal to this. Now why is that useful? Well, we know that x is equal to tangent of y. So this is going to be equal to one over one plus tangent of y is equal to x squared, which is pretty exciting. We just figure out the derivative of y with respect to x. So the derivative of this thing with respect to x is one over one plus x squared. So we could write that right up here. So this is going to be equal to one over one plus x squared. And we are done.
