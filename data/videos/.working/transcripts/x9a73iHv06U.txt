Cheppy is an ecologist who studies the change in the narwhal population of the Arctic Ocean over time. She observed that the population loses 5.6% of its size every 2.8 months. The population of narwhals can be modeled by a function n, which depends on the amount of time t in months. When Cheppy began the study, she observed that there were 89,000 narwhals in the Arctic Ocean. Write a function that models the population of narwhals t months since the beginning of Cheppy's study. Like always, pause the video and see if you can do it on your own before we work through it together. So now let's work through it together, and to get a sense of what this function needs to do, it's always valuable to see, to create a table for some interesting inputs for the function and seeing how the function should behave. So first of all, if t is in months and n of t is, n is the, that models, n is the number of narwhals, or narwhals, so when t is equal to zero, what is n of zero? Well we know at t equals zero, there are 89,000 narwhals in the ocean. So 89,000. And now what's another interesting one? Well t is in months, and we know that the population decreases 5.6% every 2.8 months. So let's think about when t is 2.8, 2.8 months. Well then the population should have gone down 5.6%. So going down 5.6% is the same thing as retaining, what's one minus 5.6%, retaining 94.4%. Let me be clear, 100%, if you lose 5.6%, you are going to be left with 94.4%. The 0.6 plus 0.4 gets you to 95, plus another 5 gets you 100. So another way of saying this sentence, that the population loses 5.6% of its size every 2.8 months, is to say that the population is 94%, 94.4% of its size every 2.8 months, or shrinks to 94.4% of its original size every, or let me phrase this clearly. After every 2.8 months, the population, you could either say it shrinks 5.6%, or you could say it's gone from, it's 94.4% of the population at the beginning of those 2.8 months. So after 2.8 months, the population should be 89,000 times, I could write times 94.4%, or I could write times 0.944. Now if we go another 2.8 months, so 2 times 2.8, I obviously could just write that as, I could write that as 5.6 months, but let me just write this as 2.8 months. Where are we gonna be? We're gonna be at 89,000 times 0.944. This is where we were before at the beginning of this period, and we're gonna be 94.4% of that. So we're gonna multiply by 94.4% again, or 0.944 again, or we can just say times 0.944 squared. And after three of these periods, well, we're gonna be times 0.944 again. So it's gonna be 89,000 times 0.944 squared times 0.944, which is gonna be 0.944 to the third power. And I think you might see what's going on here. We have an exponential function. Between every 2.8 months, we are multiplying by this common ratio of 0.944. And so we can write our function, N of T. Our initial value is 89,000, 89,000 times 0.944 to the power of however many of these 2.8 month periods we've gone so far. So if we take the number of months and we divide by 2.8, that's how many 2.8 month periods we have gone. And so notice, when T equals zero, all of this turns into one, you raise something to the zero power, it just becomes one, you have 89,000. When T is equal to 2.8, this exponent is one, and we're gonna multiply by 0.944 once. When T is 5.6, the exponent is going to be two, and we're gonna multiply by 0.944 twice. And I'm just doing the values that make the exponent integers, but it's going to work for the ones in between. I encourage you to graph it or to try those values on a calculator if you like. But there you have it, we're done. We have modeled our narwhales. So let me just underline that, we're done.
