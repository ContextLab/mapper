Let's write an arithmetic sequence in general terms. Arithmetic sequence. So we can start with some number a, and then we can keep adding d to it. And that number that we keep adding, which could be a positive or negative number, we call our common difference. So the second term in our sequence will be a plus d. The third term in our sequence will be a plus 2d. So we keep adding d all the way to the nth term in our sequence. And you already see here that in our first term we added d zero times. Our second term we added d once. In our third term we added d twice. So you see whatever the index of the term is, we're adding d one less than that many times. So if we go all the way, if we were to go all the way to the nth term, we're going to add d one less than n times. So it's going to be n minus one times d. Fair enough. And let me write that. This right over here is our nth term. Now what I want to do is think about what the sum of this arithmetic sequence would be. And the sum of an arithmetic sequence we call an arithmetic series. So let me write that in yellow. The arith, that's not yellow. So let me, color changing is sometimes difficult. So arith, arith-matic sequence, sorry, arith-matic series is just the sum of an arith-matic sequence. So let's call my arith-matic series, let's call it s sub n. And let's say, well it's just going to be the sum of these terms. It's going to be a plus a plus d plus a plus 2d, a plus 2d plus all the way to adding the nth term, which is a plus n minus one times d. Now I'm going to do the same trick that I did when I did the most basic arithmetic sequence. I'm going to add this to itself, but I'm going to swap the order in which I write this sum. So the s sub n, I can write as this, but I'm going to write it in reverse order. I'm going to write the last term first. So the nth term is a plus n minus one times d. Then the second to last term is going to be a plus n minus two times d. The third to last is going to be a plus n minus three n minus three times d. And we're going to go all the way down to the first term, which is just a. Now let's add these two equations. We are going to get, on the left-hand side, s sub n plus s sub n, you're going to get two times s sub n. It's going to be equal to, what's the sum of these two first terms right over here? We're going to have a plus a plus n minus one times d. So it's going to be two a plus n minus one times d. Now let's add both of these second terms. So if I were to add both of these second terms, what do I get? I'm going to get two a plus two a. And what's d plus n minus two times d? So you could view it several ways. You could view this, let me write this over here. What is d plus n minus two times d? Well, this is just the same thing as one d plus n minus two times d. And so you could just add the coefficients. So this is going to be n minus two plus one times d, which is equal to n minus one times d. So this second term also becomes two a plus n minus one times d. Now let's add the third term. I'll do it in green, or the third terms I should say. And I think you're going to see a pattern here. It's two a, so plus two a plus, if I have two plus n minus three of something, if I have n minus three of something and then I add two, I'm going to have n minus one of that something. So plus n minus one times d. And you're going to keep doing that all the way until your nth pair of terms, all the way until you add these two characters over here, which is just two a plus n minus one times d. So you have this two a plus n minus one d being added over and over and over again. And how many times are you doing that? Well, you had n pairs of terms when you were adding these two equations. Or in each of them, you had n terms. This is the first term, this is the second term, this is the third term, all the way to the nth term. So I can rewrite this sum as two, or the two times the sum, two times s sub n, is going to be n times this quantity. It's going to be n times two a plus two a plus n minus one times d. And then if we want to solve for s sub n, you just divide both sides by two, and you get s sub n is equal to, and we get ourselves a little bit of a drum roll here, n times two a plus n minus one times d, all of that over two. Now, we've come up with a general formula just a function of what our first term is, what our common difference is, and how many terms we're adding up. And so this is the generalized sum of an arithmetic sequence, which we call an arithmetic series. But now let's ask ourselves this question. This is kind of hard to remember, n times two a plus n minus one times d over two. But in the last video, when I did a more concrete example, I said, well, it looks like an arithmetic sequence, it looks like the sum of an arithmetic sequence could be written as, perhaps could be written as, the average of the first term, a one plus a n, the average of the first term and the last term, so that's the average of the first term and the last term, times the number of terms that you have. So is this actually the case? Is this actually the case? Do these two things gel? Because this is very easy to remember, the average of the first and the last terms multiplied by the number of terms you had, it actually makes intuitive sense, because you're just increasing by the same amount every time. So let's just average the first, or let's just average the first and the last term, and then multiply times the number of terms we have. Well, all we have to do is rewrite this a little bit to see that it is indeed the exact same thing as this over here. So all we have to do is break out the a, so let me rewrite it. So this could be rewritten as s of n is equal to n times a, a plus a plus n minus one times d, I just broke up this two a into an a plus a, all of that over two. And you see, based on how we defined this thing, our first term, a one is a, a one is a, and then our last term, a sub n, is a plus n minus one times d. So this whole business, all of this business right over here, all of this business right over here really is the average of the first and last terms. I got my first term, adding it to my last term, dividing it by two, and then I'm multiplying by the number of terms we have. And that's true for any arithmetic sequence, as we've just shown here.
