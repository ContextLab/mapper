We're told to graph the image of triangle PQR after a dilation by a scale factor of two thirds about the point negative one comma two. So pause this video and have a go at it before we do this together. So in other videos, we've done pure dilation by a scale factor about the origin. But what's different here is we're about a point that's not the origin. So what I'd like to do is first do a translational transformation so that the point negative one comma two gets shifted to the origin. Then we do a scale factor about that origin, about zero zero. And then we can do the translation back from the origin to the point negative one comma two. And the whole time I'm going to describe each of these compounding dilation in coordinate notation so we can get the final dilation. So the first thing I wanna do is I wanna shift the point negative one comma two. So that's negative one comma two, this point right over here. I want to shift that to the origin. In order to shift that to the origin, I have to shift to the right by one and down by two. So the first transformation I'm going to do is I'm going to take x comma y and whatever my x is, I'm gonna add one, that shifts me to the right by one and whatever my y is, I'm going to subtract two. Now that will definitely shift negative one comma two to the origin, but what does it do to our triangle? Well, everything shifts to the right by one and down two, to the right by one and down two, to the right by one and down two. And so after this transformation, my triangle looks like this. My triangle looks like this. And we can see what these coordinate points are, which is going to be important as we're about to do the actual dilation. This point right over here is the point six comma three, six comma three, this is the point nine comma zero. And this is the point negative three comma, oh, sorry, it's zero negative three. I get confused sometimes. Zero negative three, right? If we did that right, yep, six, three, nine, zero, zero, negative three. Now the next thing we want to do is dilation by a scale factor of two thirds. To do that, we essentially just multiply every x and y by two thirds. So if we want to write it in coordinate notation, whatever our coordinates are now, we're going to multiply by two thirds. So now we just multiply two thirds times each of these. So two thirds times x plus one, and then two thirds times y minus two. And then if we look at this, if we see what each of these points become, zero times two thirds is still zero, negative three times two thirds. Let me do this in a new color. Negative three times two thirds is negative two. Nine times two thirds is six, zero times two thirds is zero, so it maps over here. And then six times two thirds is four, and then three times two thirds is two. So this becomes four two, four two. And so now our triangle has been dilated about the origin to look like this. Now the last thing we want to do is shift back so that the origin goes back to negative one comma two. So we just want to undo this transformation right over here. And so that last step, what I'm going to do, I start with this point two thirds times x plus one. And now I want to subtract that one to be able to shift back to the left. And then likewise here, this coordinate, two third y minus two, this y coordinate, I want to shift it back up by two. So each of these points, I'm going to shift to the left by one and up by two. Actually, let me do this in another new color. So to the left by one and up by two. To the left by one and up by two. To the left by one and up by two. And so my triangle finally looks like this. And then this is my final dilation in coordinate notation, but I want to simplify it a little bit. Well, actually, let's see, is there, yeah, I guess I might as well simplify it, do a little bit of algebra. So this is going to be the x one, the x coordinate is two thirds x plus two thirds minus one. And then this is two, the y coordinate is two thirds y minus four thirds plus two. Now two thirds minus one is the same thing as negative one third. So this is two thirds x minus one third. And then this over here, if I have negative four thirds plus two, two is six thirds. So this is going to be the same thing as two thirds. So it's going to be two thirds y plus two thirds. And we're done, I could put this in here. This is two thirds x minus one third. And then this is two thirds y plus two thirds. And we are done.
