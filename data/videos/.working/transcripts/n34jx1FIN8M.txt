Let's see if we can take the indefinite integral of sine to the fourth, or sine of x to the fourth, sine of x to the fourth dx. And like always, pause the video and see if you can work through it on your own. So if this was a, if we had an odd exponent up here, whether it was a sine or a cosine, then the technique I would use, if so if this was sine to the third of x, I would separate one of the sine of x's out, so I would rewrite it as sine squared x times sine of x, and then I would convert this using the Pythagorean identity, and then when I distribute the sine of x, I'd be able to use u-substitution, and we've done that in previous example videos, and you could have done this if it was cosine to the third of x as well, or to the fifth or to the seventh, if you had an odd exponent. But here we have an even exponent, so what do we do? And so the technique we will use, and I guess you could call it a trick, the technique or trick to use is, once again you want to just algebraically manipulate this so that you can use integration techniques that we are familiar with, and in this case we would want to use the double angle identity. So the double angle identity tells us that sine squared of x is equal to, is equal to 1 half times one minus cosine of two x, cosine of two x, so how can I apply this over here? Well our original integral is just the same thing as, this is going to be the same thing as the integral of sine of x squared, all of that squared, dx. Now I can make this substitution, so this, this, this is the same thing as this, which is of course the same thing as this by the double angle identity. So I can rewrite it as, I can rewrite it as the integral of 1 half times one minus cosine of two x, and then all of that squared, all of that squared dx, and what is that going to be equal to? That's going to be equal to, well I see 1 half squared is 1 fourth, so I can take that out. So we get 1 fourth times the integral of, so I'm just gonna square all of this business, 1 squared, which is 1 minus 2 cosine of two x plus cosine squared of two x dx. dx, now fairly straightforward to take the, to take the indefinite integral, or to take the anti-derivative of these two pieces, but what do I do here? Well once again I've got an even exponent, let's apply the double angle identity for cosine. So we know that cosine squared of two x is going to be equal to 1 half times one plus cosine of double this angle, so cosine of four x. So once again, just make the substitution. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, actually, oh let me just write it this way, 1 fourth, and I'll, maybe I'll switch, well I'll keep it in this color, 1 fourth times one minus two cosine two x plus, plus, plus 1 half, I'll just distribute the 1 half, plus 1 half, plus 1 half cosine of four x dx. Cosine of four x dx, let's see, I could take this, not that one, I could take this 1 half and add it to this one, and that's gonna get me 3 halves. So add those together, I'm gonna get 3 halves. And so let me rewrite this as, I'm in the home stretch really, so this is going to be equal to 1 fourth times the integral of 3 halves minus two cosine of two x. And then, let's see, the derivative of four x is four, so it'd be great if I had a four out here. So let me rewrite this, let me rewrite 1 half as four over eight. I'm just multiplying and dividing by four is one way to think about it, so I could say plus, plus 1 eighth times four cosine of four x. And I'm just doing this so that it's, in theory you could do u-substitution, but we've had a lot of practice with this, was hey, I have function, I have its derivative, I can just integrate with respect to the four x right over there. So I guess you could say it's the reverse chain rule, which is really what u-substitution is all about. And now I'm ready to integrate. So this is going to be equal to, I think we deserve a little bit of a drum roll, 1 fourth times 3 halves x. 3 halves x. See, derivative of two x is sitting right over here too, so this is going to be minus sine of two x. We can verify this is, let's see, derivative of this is going to be two cosine of two x, yep, we have it right over there. Plus, plus 1 eighth times, well, sine of four x. Derivative of sine of four x is going to be four cosine of four x, which is exactly what we have there. And then, homestretch, we just write the plus c, plus sub constant, this is an indefinite integral. And we're all done. This wasn't the simplest of problems, but it also wasn't too bad, and it's strangely satisfying to get it done.
