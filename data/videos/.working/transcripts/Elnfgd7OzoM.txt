Let's start with a creative lesson hook. ConMigo, are you ready to get started? Absolutely, me too. Let's get going. It's been a while since I've taught Romeo and Juliet, so ConMigo, can you please help me come up with a creative lesson hook for Act 3 of Romeo and Juliet for my 9th grade English class? Of course you can. ConMigo came up with two fantastic hooks that I can use with my students. Hmm, actually, on second thought, a lot of my students think that Shakespeare is boring. ConMigo, can you give me a funny hook that will help keep my students engaged? So starting the class with a Shakespearean insult? That is hilarious and my students will love it. Thanks ConMigo. Okay ConMigo, I'm going to need a quick check for understanding to use with my students to make sure that they understand Act 3 before moving on to Act 4. Could you please help me create an exit ticket for them? Wow, these are wonderful thought-provoking questions. It's really going to show me whether or not my students need more support with Act 3 of Romeo and Juliet. Thanks so much ConMigo, I think Mr. Shakespeare would approve. After revealing my students' exit tickets, I'm noticing that there are a few students who still aren't quite grasping the concepts in the play. So who better to help them than Mr. William Shakespeare himself? Excuse us Mr. Shakespeare, but could you please help my class understand why Friar Lawrence didn't intervene with Romeo and Juliet? Great explanation. Couldn't have said it better myself. That was super helpful.
