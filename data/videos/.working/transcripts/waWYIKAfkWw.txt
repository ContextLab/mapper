Let's see if we can figure out what the limit of x squared plus one over sine of x is as x approaches infinity. So let's just think about what's going on in the numerator and then think about what's going on in the denominator. So the numerator we have x squared plus one. So as x gets larger and larger and larger as it approaches infinity, well we're just squaring it here, so this numerator's gonna approach infinity even faster. So this thing is going to go to infinity as x approaches infinity. Now what's happening to the denominator here? Well sine of x, we've seen this before, sine of x and cosine of x are bounded, they oscillate. They oscillate between negative one and one. So negative one is gonna be less than or equal to sine of x, which is going to be less than or equal to one. So this denominator's going to oscillate. So what does that tell us? Well we might be tempted to say, well the numerator is unbounded, goes to infinity, and then the denominator's just oscillating between these values here. So maybe the whole thing goes to infinity. But we have to be careful, because one, this denominator is going between positive and negative values. So the numerator's just gonna get more and more and more positive, but we're being divided sometimes by positive values, sometimes by a negative value. So we're gonna jump between positive and negative, positive and negative, and then you also have all these crazy asymptotes here. Every time sine of x becomes zero, well then you're gonna have a vertical asymptote. This thing will not be defined. So you're gonna have all these vertical asymptotes, you're gonna oscillate between positive and negative, just larger and larger values, and so this limit does not exist. So does not exist. Does not exist. And we can see that graphically, we've described it in words, just inspecting this expression, but we can see it graphically if we actually look at a graph of this, which I have right here, and you can see that as x goes towards positive infinity, as x goes to positive infinity, depending on which x we are, we're kinda going, we get really large, then we have a vertical asymptote that we jump back down, we get really negative, vertical asymptote, up, down, up, down, up, down, it just, the oscillations just get more and more extreme, but we keep having these vertical asymptotes on a periodic basis, so it's very clear that this limit does not exist.
