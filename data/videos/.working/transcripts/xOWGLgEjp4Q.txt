The broadcast is now starting. All attendees are in listen-only mode. Hi everybody, thanks so much for joining us today. I'm Vicky Lang, I'm our learning scientist here at Khan Academy, and I'm joined by Dan from our marketing team who will be facilitating our Q&A toward the end of the broadcast. And a special guest, Dr. Lindsey Portnoy. She's a cognitive scientist from a Northeastern University who recently published a book called Design to Learn. She's an expert in using design principles to work with kids in schools. And she's a parent of two children herself. So she's home working, managing multiple kids and is a great expert to draw from for this broadcast today. Before we launch into the topic, I just wanna thank our sponsors, Bank of America, Google.org, Novartis, Fastly, and AT&T for supporting this broadcast as well as other webinars that we're providing during this time of crisis. So we've been getting a lot of questions about how do I survive at home with multiple children who have different schedules and different needs and different assignments, and there's only one of me or there's two of me or however many. And how do we do this? So we brought this expert here to talk with you about some ideas for that, and I'm gonna let her kick it off. Thank you, Vicky. Thank you for having me everyone. I'm excited to be here today. So yeah, as Vicky had mentioned, I have been working in education for quite some time, and when this whole event transpired, quickly we moved to sort of figure out what it was that we were going to do to help support our kiddos and create some sense of scaffolding and support in a time of serious uncertainty. And so what I have shared for you today is something that I like to call the five Cs for bringing your A-game. And what I realized is that we really are a very faithful family, and we do very much the joy in all of the learning that we try to do at home. And so the Cs that I'd like to share with you are clarity, creation, creativity, curiosity, compassion. And I'm gonna go through each of these and sort of how they address those main questions that Vicky has shared previously, and Vicky, hopefully you can help me along here to make sure that we're getting at the most important pieces. But the idea is that we're trying to keep it as simple as possible. We're trying to be as realistic as possible given the current constraints. As I'm speaking to now, we have lost power. So it's always something exciting and new, but simplicity with consistency and always leaving room for iteration. The first C for clarity, I think is a really big overarching concept, which is basically about establishing expectations, understanding communications and resources. And it was really to address this question here about what ideas you have for scheduling with such a diverse group. So as Vicky and I were talking, I shared with her my game plan, right? So we, you gaming is sort of the analogy. What's the game plan with our team? So at the beginning of each week, if we have a teacher that's sending a week, okay, so what has to be done and by whom? And I've created this really simple and sort of fun looking calendar that my kiddos are now at this point quite used to in week eight and they know what's happening at every time, where they will find what they need and where we will find what we need to help support them, where everyone will be in the house in terms of space. We'll talk about that later. And then when you know it's time to stop what you're doing and have a break and eat and relax and sort of stretch and just check in with us. Also, another really important part of clarity for us is then why are you doing what you're doing and when are you going to get feedback on the work that you're doing? And that really is about communication. And I'll show you later on, this is just the big game plan sheet that we have, but later on I'll show you a little bit about how I share feedback with my kids as they're working without necessarily getting up and having to physically go to them and sit with them every second of the day, which became pretty burdensome pretty quickly. Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes lots of sense. And it doesn't work perfectly. We just saw, I was distracted because my six-year-old came in and had a question for me just now. So it doesn't work perfectly. But we have a schedule also at our house and we've done another webinar on that with Khan Academy. And this idea of clarity and just the kids kind of being on the same page as the adults of understanding what's happening when and who to get help with and why they're doing what they're doing is really, really important. So how do they know what to work on, Lindsey? And how do you prepare it for them? Very good question. That's a great question. So the next C is curation. And curation is really all about preparation, right? So predicting what they're gonna need and when and planning ahead. And this reminded me of the question that I saw, which is, how much active caregiver engagement should I aim for and when? When should I be available? Because like many folks out there, we are working full-time and so we have to ensure that we're doing our work. So again, this is a similar picture to the other one, but this is our schedule. And the idea is we have to know ahead of time what the work is that they have to be doing in each day. But we also have to predict sort of what problems may arise and whether it's my two boys getting in an argument over who gets to use the computer at this time or figuring out what hangouts they might have to log in to one of the platforms they use in my kids' school is clever. So if they have trouble logging in, where can they go and sort of just anticipating what potential issues they may have. And then also making sure that the materials that they need are accessible for them, right? So that they know which space they're gonna be sitting in and when in terms of timing for each child, we try to figure out a day in advance if we can sometimes the week. And that way we can sort of see who's gonna need more time and when. I mean, I don't know how you're feeling with your kiddo, but for us, this has been really helpful just to sort of know ahead of time what information we're gonna need to give to them so that we can have it in one place. I circled here for you the hyperlink. I'm a big fan of hyperlinking because that way they know where their schedule is. Everything is in Google Doc. And then they click on the hyperlink and it takes them right to where they have to go. And there's no questioning. They don't have to come and ask me for the website or the access or whatever. It's already all there. It's like baked into the document. Yeah, and this makes me... It's similar to what... Oh, sorry, go ahead. No, I was wondering, is this similar to what you're using? Yeah, and it makes me think of when I was in the classroom. I was a fifth and sixth grade teacher. And one of the most fundamental things you're doing when you're a teacher is anticipating roadblocks that kids are gonna hit and questions that they're gonna have and trying to set them up for success in advance. Because can you imagine if there's 27 students and they all have different questions and you haven't anticipated that? It's a management nightmare. So this is a skill that teachers have. And when I'm baking with my daughter is another thing it makes me think of. If you think about cooking with your children when they're young, it helps if you sort of... I know it's easier for me if I set out the measuring tools and the ingredients ahead of time. And maybe I already have a list of how much of each ingredient we need or maybe I've already measured it out and they can just help me by mixing. That goes much more smoothly than if I just say, hey, let's bake cookies. And we go into the kitchen at the same time and I'm looking for stuff and she's like eating the chocolate chips while I'm not looking. And there's like everything at once. It helps a lot. It's hard sometimes to find the time ahead of time to invest to make a plan. But on the weeks and days when I am able to do that, the actual day, rest of the day goes much more smoothly. That does sound very familiar. Absolutely. No, I mean, for sure. And it's super familiar. And again, and that was like using the game as the frame here, knowing the different players and knowing what they're gonna be because every kid is gonna need something different. One of my kids is much, much faster at sort of going through the writing part of his work. And the other one needs a little bit more help and support and scaffolding. And so even just knowing where in the day they're gonna need a little extra sort of love and encouragement so I can go and make myself available to them or maybe switch where it is in the day. So if for instance, I know that there's a big writing project, maybe I'll put it at a time when I know I don't have meetings with my colleagues so that I can be available to him and help him out. So yes, know where your plan is. The next one, if it's all right, if I move along, is creativity. And here I'm talking about multiple opportunities to soar. And again, the folks that were asking questions about what happens in multi-age families, how do you create a schedule where when there's an older kid and they see their younger sibling play, they'd rather play. And that is very real. So again, following along with the game analogy is leveling up by being creative and being flexible and thinking outside the box about, for instance, where people are working at different times of the day. So we have sort of quiet spaces where we know that we can go to if we have a meeting, if we have to do a go-to webinar, we know that nobody's going to bother us there. And then there are other spaces that are more open. And of course, this isn't easy every place and it's not a perfect panacea. But just being creative and flexible about where we should be at different times of day. And then sort of setting aside when we know we're gonna have lunch together, for instance, which is a lovely thing, but if we don't make it for them, we have to make sure that we have, and we've snapped that for the kids. We really, they've become so, so much more independent about finding what they need. I don't know if you're having the same experience, but it's been quite impressive. Flexibility in the resources and who has access to devices. Also in communicating. So one of the things we talked about earlier in teachers do this in speeds is give great feedback, right? And so how do we continue to help them get feedback? Their teachers are still giving them feedback in many instances. And during the day, we need to sort of be helping them with that as well. So I have on the screen over here, the morning reflections. I have my kiddos right. Morning reflection, and I have them reflect the end of the day with what I call today I learned. And there are a bunch of questions for them just to think about. And as they're writing them, sometimes I'll give them feedback in there, or I'll just sort of write a little note to them. I'm like, wow, I was really impressed to see, when you flew through that, or my older son wrote this beautiful, compelling argument for why the US women's soccer team should get equitable pay to the men's soccer team. And I was really taken with it. And so I gave him feedback here, and I could tell, I mean, he was so excited, and he came running in, and we had a great conversation about it. So I think communication is key. You can do it in Google Docs, you can use post-it notes. I have whiteboard here. I think it's fun if you have a space for a family whiteboard. We don't, but it would be a really great thing if we could. And also being creative about the responsibilities and reflecting on what is working and what's not working. Yeah, and I'm seeing just, I totally agree with all of those suggestions. And I wanted to say I'm seeing some questions about some of these resources in particular. And I wanted to say that we're gonna share some links to some of these resources for morning reflection and schedules and things at the end. So you'll have those. Yeah, all of the templates are available for free. You should have access to all of them. We'll make sure that you do afterwards. The next one is the next C. I think it's very important that sometimes it's okay for us to just let them play. I think that this moment is a very tense moment for many of us for a host of reasons. And so I really think it's important that we allow our kids to sometimes just play. Just go outside if you plan, go ride a bike, go read a book. We have certainly had more hours on Fortnite and Minecraft and probably I'd like to admit. And I'm okay with that right now. In fact, I'm okay with that in general. That's a different conversation. But I think that one of the really important pieces here is that it's okay for your kids to play. The next one is curiosity. And I say game on to curiosity. One of the things that I think we should be more curious about is that feedback piece we were talking about earlier. I have a whole, my kids were doing these reflections and they were like, well, mom, you're not telling me if I'm doing it right or not. And I was surprised that they actually wanted the feedback. They wanted to know if they were doing it, what else they could do to make it better, or did I see it? So I created for them sort of a super simple one point rubric that I shared and I'll share with you all as well. Also being reflective on what they're learning while they're learning it. What did you love? What is something that you never would have thought that you would have been excited to learn about? My kids got so excited about studying, they're studying ancient Greece and he was so excited and inspired to learn about it. And he said, you know, if I hadn't had the time to sit there and watch that documentary, I don't know if I really would have gotten this vested in it. So I think that, you know, game on, be curious. Silver linings for us, I'm able to spend time having lunch with my kids maybe once or twice a week, but that's once or twice a week more than I ever did before. And to me, that's incredible. Also in finding new ways to play, I have this sheet that I'll share with you as well. It's called While You Were Waiting. And it's, and basically there are two columns. So if you have an internet connected device, you have a host of things that you could do. If you don't, you have a host of things that you can do and I'll share them with you as well. And so there are amazing opportunities that our kids can be doing if they're waiting for us, if they need us to help them before they can move along, they don't have to stop playing, they don't have to stop learning because as we know, we are always learning, especially when we're playing. How does that sound? That makes lots of sense as well. There's so many great suggestions in here. So we're ready for, I believe the last one and maybe the most important one we probably should have started here, but compassion. And I think, you know, everyone's asking the same questions about how do we serve all of our kids? How do we meet their needs? And these are the questions that teachers ask every single day. And so I think we're getting a really important glimpse into the life of what it is to be a teacher. And I think that in terms of compassion, the most important thing right now is that we are compassionate, maximum XPs to level up to get, you know, to achieve a higher score, be compassionate with our kids and their teachers and ourselves. And I have an asterisk here because not only is it made for it, it's also teacher appreciation week. So I wanted to just sort of call out that we have these incredible humans that teach our kids all day, every day, all year. And we really are now seeing, I mean, always, but how important they are in our lives. And I just wanted to, as we're compassionate with ourselves and our kids, also reach out to our teachers. Also be compassionate and communicating the reality of what's happening in this world right now. And also being flexible with the expectations. If you need to reach out to your teachers and let them know that your kid is struggling and, you know, can't do the work or just needs a break, that's okay. And I think we need to have permission to do that. And again, you'll notice I said, don't forget to play because I think that's important as well. Yeah, this is so important. And it can be really hard too because we wear so many hats. We want everything to be just right. And it also is very emotionally draining, especially if our kids are fighting or if our kids don't want to do what they are supposed to do. It can be very emotionally exhausting for any adult. And at those times it can be really hard to maintain compassion with yourself or with your kiddos as well. It's really important. Yeah, I mean, I think it's important to remember what is most important right now. And, you know, if you are together and you do have the ability to be together with your kids, that's a great gift. And just, I guess taking a minute to just breathe and be okay with where you are and forgive yourself and hope that the world around you is going to be as compassionate. And if you're not, let me know. I'm excited about the help and find that compassion. The next piece that I really wanted to share is that there are over 76 million students in K to higher ed schools in the United States right now. And many of those individuals are currently learning at home. And why is that important? It's important because we're not alone. And as we're struggling, and as it's important to have these scaffolds and as it's important to have all of these great resources to sort of tap into and ways to give our kids feedback and help them keep learning and stay on track and make sure that they're not losing any instructional time. It's also important to remember just as if we're being compassionate, that we're not alone, that we really are in this together and that together we can move through this. And hopefully my goal is all of us should be better on the other end than maybe we were going into this in terms of education. I wanted to share also with you a quote that is one of my favorites. I have no idea who said this when I had my first son, my husband bought him his postcard and it just didn't have an offer, but it was survival is the new success. So let's just keep moving one day at a time. There's no such thing as perfection. Interest makes everything look easy. It's not, and it's okay to be messy. In fact, I think that that's where the best learning happens. So what I have for you here are a couple of different slides on resources, the daily activities that I made for MyKiddos that the game plan is available, as are the morning reflections in the stay-aligned. There's some really incredible content that we have pulled from Khan Academy that MyKiddos have gotten engaged with in terms of writing Pixar in a box. It was incredible. And what I did is I created a document for them so that they could document their learning as they were using the Khan Academy content. But there's also the MIT work there is extraordinary. So it was the big history project. There are tons of amazing resources. I also shared the feedback for the win. So if you want to give your kids feedback in a Google document, very easy, just take it, copy it, download it, use it for yourself and a list of while you're waiting, whether or not you have a device. There's plenty of stuff to do. And then here are some non-tech and tech toys and games and sort of playful experiences that you might wanna check out in this interesting time. And one of the things that I wanted to call out here is that you could challenge your kids to create their own versions. I don't know if you've ever played here, have you ever played Slaps with your kiddo? No, I don't know. It's a great game and it's a great game that you could play and have her create a version so you guys could play together. All of these are games that are pretty easy for your kids to hack. And then they themselves can play the game that they've created, which is also very fun to do. So I wanted to end on a light note because it's a very heavy time. I wanted to save me the fourth day with you. And I know we probably have tens and tons of questions. So if you'd like to go to them, we can do that. We can go back and look at any of the slides. Yeah, no, we have, I wish we had an extra half an hour to answer all of these wonderful questions that Dan has been compiling for us to look at. So we'll try to keep our answers to the point so we can get to as many of them as possible. Dan, I'm gonna turn it over to you to facilitate that part. Yeah, thank you, Lindsay, and thank you, Vicki. Hi, everyone, I'm Dan, and I'll be moderating the live Q&A session. Two things before we get into the questions section. First, go to the handout section of this webinar and grab a copy of the presentation. It contains all of the tips, the Cs that Lindsay walked through, clarity, curation, creativity, curiosity, and compassion. And it has the links to all of those resources that both Lindsay created, as well as Khan Academy links to just some of our normal resources that you can find on our site as well. We already have a ton of questions. First, before we start, I just ask for all of your patience, just because we have so many and we only have about 10 minutes, and we'll try to get through as many as we can. Please submit more, and we'll try to get, we'll try to get through as many as we can. All right, I get to ask the easy questions, and then Vicki and Lindsay will do the hard job of actually trying to answer these. Lindsay, there's a great question on reflection. So what actually is it? So there's a question from M.A. Lorraine. What do you mean by morning reflections? Can you just give a quick high level overview of what that means? Yeah, so the morning reflection of the document that I made for my kids, and it really is just reflecting on what they've done so far during the day. So anytime before, it's typically, they typically do it the last thing before lunch, and there's a question of, you know, what did you read today, and how did it make you feel? What did it remind you of? So it's some of the similar questions that you probably are familiar with from your kids answering in school, making the text to text, text to self, text to world connections. I also ask them, you know, I have a whole bunch of just silly questions, you know, how do you define curiosity? Or what does it mean to be creative? Or if you were to be a scientific explorer, where would you go and what would you want to discover? So they really are just a host of questions that my kids respond to every day. You have them for free, I think, on the handout. I added them all there. Does that help? Yeah, that's great. Do you have any opinions? Like, what's a question that you ask your kid every day? Oh, we, every day, we reflect more at the end of the day on what's something that happened to you today that was good. What was happened to you or that you felt or experienced that was good, something that was a no thanks, and something that was confusing. And that helps kids to see like the whole spectrum of life experience, not just to focus on what's good. I like that, I'm gonna use the no thanks moment. What are you for? We have a great question about just timing and how to schedule these things. So from Laura, she asks, how much time each week should I expect to spend less than planning, planning out a schedule per child? Some teachers have provided a daily plan, some have, some haven't. So just curious, if you all have some perspective on both of those things. Vicki, perhaps you first, then, Lindsay, you could take it from there. I don't, I spend time at breakfast with my daughter planning her day while we're eating, and it takes 10 minutes and she's very excited about it. But I have a couple of just go to, I have a book of math problems, we just do a page from that every day that are like kind of thoughtful, discussion-based questions, she spends time reading. So I have repeated activities and don't need to plan fresh lessons every day. I use bedtime math, is what I'm using right now. Lindsay, what about you? How much time are you spending? So I would say that we are, I have, I don't know if I said this before, I have a fourth and a sixth grader. And so I have to give a lot of credit, their teachers are still sending lessons. So it's not as if I'm fully lesson planning for my kids. At the beginning of this, when I was lesson planning for my kids, I was pulling from different resources and I was being very flexible by saying, look, instead of having 45 minutes of a particular subject area, you'll have an hour and a half to explore. And so, you know, I don't know, I had this flexible template that maybe took me a couple of hours on a weekend to put together and I would just sort of iterate throughout the week. It was not a happy burden. If you have younger kids and you do need more flexible planning, I think it's just a matter of making materials accessible for them, whether it's, you know, Play-Doh or paint or games that they can play with siblings or, you know, by themselves. I think it just depends, it's widely varied. It depends on if the teacher is giving you work, how old the child is, but it shouldn't be an exhaustive experience. Yeah, that's good. That's a good point. We have a question from Nima who has kids ages seven and nine who keep comparing the amount of homework with each other. I think that it's probably, you know, she has less, he has less or something like that. What should Nima do about that? That's a really great question. So in our house, it's a really great opportunity to talk about the difference between equity and equality. I have a fourth and a sixth grader and, you know, that's not fair. He's done first. That's not fair. He's done first. And I say, well, you know, that's interesting. And, you know, to my sixth grader, you know, what happens if I would give both of you the same test for a sixth grader? Well, of course the sixth grader would finish faster and the fourth grader would struggle. So everyone's really getting what they need and it's not always the same thing. This is very much like a very typical parenting conundrum. And the best thing that you can do is saying everybody is getting exactly what they need to meet them where they are and to help them grow. And maybe instead of, you know, being upset that somebody has more to do, maybe you could go and ask them, hey, can I help you? Like, what can I do to chime in and to help? That's great. We have a question from Lizzie about tips from families juggling with younger kids. I have a preschool and a first grader. So they aren't as self-sufficient. What would you recommend for that situation, Lizzie, if they need a little bit more guidance on getting set up and getting ready with certain activities and assignments? Yeah, I mean, I don't know, Vicki, if you want to chime in. I know your kid was a little smaller, but, you know, when I worked in early childhood, it was really about sending out centers, right? If you think about going into a classroom and there was different centers and I think our kids are more capable of being independent than maybe we think that they are, I think it takes a little bit of holding over time, which is the gradual release. First you say, look, hey, this is the space where we're gonna be creating flowers out of play-doh and you do it a couple of times with them and then one day magically, they don't need your help anymore because they can do that by themselves. And so whether it's practicing with scissors and cutting fun different shapes and having things cut out for them or having magazines for them that they can tear out and use Elmer's glue to stick them onto something or even if you teach them how to do a mandala or just any sort of coloring, drawing sort of activity, over time, you can slowly release. That's the point of scaffolding. They're not there forever. You have to release and let them become independent. Yeah, yeah. That's what I was thinking also was any kind of sensory play and you can Google sensory play activities for preschoolers and you'll find lists and lists and lists. Anything that's sensory, like giving a kid shaving cream, that kind of thing, will hold their attention for a while. Also note that it's not, developmentally speaking, preschoolers aren't that independent and they're not gonna be able to play on their own for a very long time and it's not appropriate to ask them to. It can be really hard for them, but at the same time, we know that we have to work and so it can really feel like this push-pull. My daughter, when my daughter was two and three, I was newly a single parent and was trying to figure out how to live alone with a two-year-old and do the dishes sometimes and I needed a little bit of space and one thing that really helped me at that time was podcasts for kids and I've mentioned that on some of these webinars before, but for my daughter, if I could give her a pile of craft supplies and put on a storytelling podcast that was age-appropriate, I could get enough time to do the dishes and that could help now if you're needing enough time to be in a meeting or do some work. That can be helpful. I wanted to say that painter's teeth is magical. It is magical because they make a ginormous mess with it and it comes off of everything and doesn't leave a mark. So if they really are tactile and needing to be doing and making and you wanna let them do that without being afraid that they're going to destroy your walls, then that's always a fun option. Great. We have a question. We're using the app to play games, right? Like you can play games on the iPad if you have or if you wanna watch a show on PBS. I mean, I'm okay with that. That's completely fine and there are great resources. Yeah. And so that's a good segue to a couple of questions we have about screen time. So some three as well as Jennifer asks, kind of both around like with a lot of remote learning as well as some of these other activities, there's a lot of screen time that their kiddos are getting. And so, and then another question around like, how much TV or tablet time is acceptable for a pre-K four-year-old? Before I pass it over to Vicki and Lindsay, I just wanna comment that the American Association of Pediatrics just released kind of a COVID-19 screen time recommendation, which is a little bit more flexible than their normal. I think their recommendation for earlier learners are like 20 minutes a day, but I think that they recognize that this is kind of unusual times and to be a little bit more flexible and forgiving about that as well. So just be sure to be mindful of that. And with that Vicki or Lindsay, do you have any opinions on screen time right now? I think we use a lot of educational apps. She does Khan Kids, we love, I love Khan Academy Kids. She'll also watch shows on PBS. I do try to limit it to no more than an hour or two a day, is what I do, but I think that's a personal, what I need in order to balance my day for work and to kind of limit it for her. We also watch, she loves science shows. We'll watch Nova or any kind of science documentary. And then she'll tell me, one thing she does is watch an episode of Nova and then write down three facts she learned or two questions she has after this show, something like that. Oh, I love that. Vicki, early on before the kids started getting homework from their teachers, we started to have a, we would have a list of sort of acceptable things to watch and we would have them share with us over dinner. The goal was that they had to watch it, but then they had to come to dinner prepared to share with us what they had learned. So it was another way to sort of build a sense of, wow, celebrating what I'm learning. I know we have more questions coming up, so I'm gonna let you keep moving along with them, Dan. Yeah, sure, so I think we have time for one more question. And this one, we have quite a few questions around, kind of as a parent, how do you stop yourself from getting upset? How do you deal with kind of your frustrations? And this is really important. So Vicki, I think maybe if you could tackle this one and then Lindsay, if you can close out with answering this as well, it's really important right now. Yeah, managing our own emotional regulation as adults in frustrating moments is really hard. And it's not, like you can't help your kid to be calm unless you're calm yourself. So this is really about, and I'll recommend some resources. It's really about being able to take a step away for a minute, take the deep breaths you need to get yourself calm again, and then come back and help them try to figure out how to solve their problem. One strategy for that is called box breathing. Very quick, you just breathe in for four, hold for four, breathe out for four, hold for four. It's a box, because it's four, four, four, four. In, hold, out, hold. And that, the military uses that, emotional scientists use that, everybody uses that, it'll like physiologically calm your nervous system down, and then you'll be in a calmer place to respond to your kids. There are also a lot of great parenting resources on this. One, I really like hand-in-hand parenting. They have a ton of resources on their website. As a parent with limited time, I like to follow my favorite parenting educators on social media. So I'll follow, like, seed and so is an Instagram account that I really like. And so it's just like, she'll post, it's a little square image on Instagram of tips about how to, like, regulate my emotions and how to regulate my kids' emotions and how to respond to her. So that's some things I would recommend, but it's, you know, what's gonna work for you, it's gonna vary. And with that, I think we'll turn it over to Lindsay to wrap up. Yeah, I mean, Vicky, I think you just did a stellar job. I think that the most important piece is that your mileage may vary. Everyone is different and everyone needs a different way for managing their stress. For me, the most important thing is acknowledging that it's okay to be frustrated and it's okay to get anxious and it's okay to be angry and to be sad and to be confused. And I think for us in our house, I'm very honest with my kids and I say to them, hey, I've never done this before, none of us have done this before. And you don't wanna lose the sense of stability and strength and certainty that everything's going to be okay, but you also wanna be vulnerable enough with your children to let them see that, you know, you're also trying to figure this out. Nobody has all the answers. We're all growing through this together. And I also think it's a really great opportunity to take perspective and to think from the perspective of your kids and how they're feeling and why they're feeling that way. And then also invite them to take the perspective of other folks in their community and in the wider global community and how it is in other places of the world, right? Cause everyone is having a different experience. We have the shared experience of this very strange pandemic, but we also have very different living experiences. And so it's an opportunity to say, you know, let's be reflective about what it is, you know, to live in different parts of the world and parts of the country. That's helped us quite a bit. And even to just verbalize that to our children, we've had some beautiful conversations, hard, beautiful conversations. Thank you, Lindsay. Thank you, Vicky. I just wanted to thank the audience for joining us. I know everyone's incredibly busy during this time and thank you for spending that time to be with us. If you missed anything or you wanna review this webinar, we'll be sending out a recording for those who registered and we'll also be making this available online as well as the presentation will also be made available in both places as well. You can always go to Khan Academy and there's a blue ribbon at the top taking you to all of our COVID response resources as well. So if you miss anything, you can always go there. And then I would ask you to do one final thing before we close out here. There's gonna be a pop-up that shows up at the end of this webinar. And we ask you to do two things for us. First, tell us how we could make future iterations of this session even better for you all. And then secondly, what other types of sessions would you like to hear from us? And we'll try to plan that out and get that out to you as soon as we can. And in closing, as I mentioned, we know you're juggling a lot and this is really uncharted territory for all of us. And I think what Lindsay and Vicky kind of closed out with is really important just as parents and as busy folks right now, just be kind to yourself. It's super important to remember that this is incredibly stressful and challenging for all of us and you're not alone. So just be mindful about being kind to yourself. So with that, we here at Khan Academy wanna remind you, please check in occasionally and thanks again and goodbye.
