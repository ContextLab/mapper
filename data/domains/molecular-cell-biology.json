      "options": {
        "A": "Integrins are bidirectional signaling receptors — 'outside-in' signaling transduces ECM binding into intracellular signals (activating FAK, Src, Rho GTPases), while 'inside-out' signaling allows intracellular events to modulate integrin affinity for ECM ligands, making them dynamic regulators of adhesion, migration, and survival",
        "B": "Integrins function only as passive adhesion molecules that mechanically attach cells to the extracellular matrix with absolutely no signaling capability — they cannot transmit information across the membrane, cannot activate intracellular kinases, cannot connect to the actin cytoskeleton through adaptor proteins, and have no bidirectional signaling capacity whatsoever",
        "C": "Integrins function only inside the nucleus as transcription factors with no role at the cell surface",

        "B": "CpG methylation (by DNMTs) recruits methyl-binding proteins that attract repressive complexes, establishing stable long-term silencing (X-inactivation, imprinting), while histone acetylation (by HATs) neutralizes positive histone charges to open chromatin structure, enabling more dynamic and reversible transcriptional activation",

        "B": "Lipid rafts are clearly visible as permanent, micrometer-scale structures in all electron microscopy images of every cell type examined — they appear as distinct, sharply bounded membrane patches that persist indefinitely and can be photographed, measured, and cataloged with routine imaging techniques, contradicting the actual difficulty of visualizing these nanoscale, transient, and controversially defined membrane microdomains",
        "C": "Lipid rafts exist only in artificial lipid bilayers and have been definitively proven to be absent from all biological membranes",
        "D": "The debate centers on their size, lifetime, and even existence in living cells — while detergent-resistant membranes and biophysical studies support ordered lipid domains, the rafts are nanoscale (~10-200 nm) and transient (milliseconds), making direct visualization in intact cells extremely difficult and raising questions about their functional relevance"

        "B": "The primary cilium serves as a dedicated signaling organelle — in the absence of Hh ligand, Patched (PTCH1) localizes to the cilium and prevents Smoothened (SMO) entry; upon Hh binding to PTCH1, SMO accumulates in the cilium and activates GLI transcription factors, which are processed at the ciliary tip from repressor to activator forms",
