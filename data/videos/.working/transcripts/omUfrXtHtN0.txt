Welcome to the presentation on level four subtraction. Let's get started with some problems. So the first problem I have here is 33,220 minus 399. So just like we did with, I believe, we also did borrowing in the level three subtraction, we have to go through all of the digits in the top number, starting with the top right digit, and make sure that they are larger than the digit below it. Because you can only subtract a smaller number from a larger number. You can't do it the other way, at least until we learn negative numbers. So let's go through this and make sure all the top numbers are larger. Well, immediately we see, no, well, this zero is not larger than nine. So we have to borrow to make the zero bigger. So what we do is we borrow one. Well, some people say we're borrowing a one. Some people say, I mean, borrowing a one from the tens place is really like borrowing a ten. So for simplicity, let's just say we're borrowing a one. So you borrow one from this two, and this ten will become a zero, sorry, will become a ten. And since we borrowed that one, this two will become a one. We took one away from this two, and we gave it to the zero to make a ten. We actually took ten away from this two, because this two's in the tens place. I don't want to confuse you too much. If just the mechanics of it are, we took one away from the two, and we put it in front of the zero to make ten. Now let's keep checking. So now we have a one in this place. One is smaller than nine, so we have to borrow again. So we borrow one from this two now. So this two now becomes one. And this one will now become an eleven. So now we have a ten is larger than a nine. Eleven is larger than a nine. One is not larger than three. So we have to borrow again. This is a good problem. Maybe I should have warmed y'all up a little bit more, but it involves a lot of borrowing. So in order to borrow, we do the same thing over again. This one will become an eleven. It's going to borrow from this three, which will become a two. I think we're done now. Ten is larger than nine. Eleven is larger than nine. Eleven is larger than three. Two is larger than nothing. Three is larger than nothing. So now we're ready to subtract. This is the easy part. Ten minus nine is one. Eleven minus nine is two. Eleven minus three is eight. Two minus nothing is two. And three minus nothing is three. So we get 32,821. So the only thing that makes this harder than just normal subtraction is that you have to know how to do the borrowing. And the way I do the borrowing, it might be different than the way you learned in school, but I think it's easier because you do all of the borrowing at once instead of switching back and forth between borrowing and subtracting. So all we did here, we said the zero is less than nine. Let's borrow one. The zero becomes a ten, because we got this one right here. We got this one from this two, and this two became a one. I think you might see the pattern if we do a couple more problems. So let's do a couple more. If I had 25,633 minus 578. It's the same drill. We start at the top right, and we make sure that the digits on top are larger than the digit below it. Immediately we see three is smaller than eight, so we have to borrow. So this three will become 13. And then we borrow from this three, which will now become two. We took a one away from this three, became two, and this one is right here. 13 is now larger than eight, but two is now smaller than seven, so we have to borrow again. This two becomes a 12, and this six will become a five. 13 is larger than eight, 12 is larger than seven. Five is the same as five, so you can actually do the subtraction, because five minus five is zero, as long as the top number's not smaller than the number below it. And then obviously this five is larger than this zero, and this two is larger than this nothing here. So now we're ready to subtract. 13 minus eight is five. 12 minus seven is five. Five minus five is zero. Five minus nothing is five. And we have to bring down the two. So the answer is 25,055. So let's do a problem now that I think will confuse you a little bit more, because the borrowing isn't as easy. You have to actually borrow from a couple places. Let's say I had 37,002 minus 155. So it's the same drill. So this two is less than five, so you have to borrow. So this two will become a 12. But, huh, there's a zero here, so you can't borrow from the zero. Some people will let you borrow from the zero, but I think that just confuses things, because you can't borrow from the zero. There's nothing there. So instead of borrowing from the zero, we look to this zero, well, there's still nothing there. So now we look, oh, there's a seven here. So what we do is, instead of borrowing a one from the zero, which is hard to do, we borrow one from this whole 700. And what is 700 minus 1? Right, it's 699. So that 700 becomes 699. Cross all of this out. And now let's check our numbers again. 12 is larger than 5. 9 is larger than 5. 9 is larger than 1. 6 is larger than nothing. And 3 is larger than nothing, so we're ready to subtract. 12 minus 5 is 7. 9 minus 5 is 4. 9 minus 1 is 8. 6 minus nothing is 6. 3 minus nothing is 3. So there, we're done. The answer is 6,847. I think we could have time for one more problem. Let's say I had 3,201 minus, let's say it's 502. Same drill. 1 is less than 2, so we have to borrow. Turn that into 11. But you can't borrow from a zero, so you're going to have to borrow from this entire 20. Well, what's 20 minus 1? Right. It's 19, so this becomes a 19. So let's check again. 11 is greater than 2. Check. 9 is greater than zero. Check. Uh-oh, 1 is not greater than 5. So you have to borrow again. This 1 becomes an 11. We borrowed from this 3, which becomes a 2. 11 is greater than 2. 9 is greater than zero. 11 is greater than 5. 2 is obviously greater than nothing below it. It's ready to subtract. 11 minus 2 is 9. 9 minus 0 is 9. 11 minus 5 is 6. And 2 minus nothing is 2. So 3,201 minus 502 is equal to 2,699. I think you're now ready to try some of the level four subtraction problems. You just always have to remember, do your borrowing first, make sure all the numbers on top are at least as large as all the numbers on the bottom, and then you can just do your subtraction like a normal subtraction problem. I hope you have some fun doing this. Talk to you later.
