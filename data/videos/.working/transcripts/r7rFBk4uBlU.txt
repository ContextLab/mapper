We are told glue sticks are sold in packs of six and packs of four. Mr. Romero wants to buy glue sticks for 28 students. It's okay with him to purchase extras. So the first question is, if Mr. Romero chooses the packs of six glue sticks, how many packs should he buy? And the second question, if Mr. Romero chooses the packs of four glue sticks, how many packs should he buy? So pause this video and have a go at both of these questions before we do this together. All right, now let's tackle this first question right over here. If we have packs of six glue sticks, well, one way to think about it is we could just say, all right, if I have one pack, that's six. If I get another pack, that's another six, how many do I have right now? Well, that's a total. Actually, let me just write it this way. Maybe I'll say packs. We have one, two, three, four, five, six. That should be enough. And then let's say the total sticks, the total number of glue sticks. So if he buys one pack, he's going to have six glue sticks. That's not enough. So two packs, he's gonna add six to that. So that's 12 glue sticks. You might recognize that as two times six. That's still not enough. We're still not, we still don't have 28. So let's add another six, that's three packs. We get to 18. I'm just adding six each time. Let's add another six, because we're still not at 28 yet. We get to 24 and four times six is 24. We're still not at 28 yet. So now let's add another six and we get to 30 because five times six is 30. So what I've just listed over here are multiples of six. And that makes sense because for every pack, I have exactly six in it. Now we see that 30 is more than enough for the 28 students. So five packs is how many Mr. Romero would have to buy. Four would not be enough because that only gets us to 24 packs. Now there's something interesting about 30. It's not a, it doesn't get us exactly to 28. So we have a remainder here. We have a remainder, we have two extra glue sticks. And that's because 28 is not a multiple of six or another way to think about it is six is not a factor of 28. So we are gonna have to overshoot. We're gonna have to buy a little bit extra. Now let's think about the situation with when we have packs of four. So I'll do the same thing. Packs, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And now let's see the total number of sticks. So one pack, we're talking about the packs of four now. That's going to be four, two packs is eight. I'm just counting up by four. Three packs is 12, I'm just adding four each time. Four packs is 16. You could also think about four packs of four is four times four is 16. If I have five packs, I'm gonna add four to that. So what I'm really doing is listing all the multiples of four. I'm increasing multiples of four, still not at 28. Well, I'm gonna add four more, get to 24, still not there, add four more, I get to 28. That is looking good. That is exactly seven packs. And we know that if we think about it this way too, seven times four is equal to 28. Another way to think about it is because if I take four and I multiply it times a whole number like this, I get a multiple of four. So 28 is a multiple of four or four is a factor of 28. And then I would buy exactly how many I need with no extra.
