During basketball practice, four students practice their free throw shots. The table below shows the proportion of free throws they each make. Let's see, Simone made 6 8s of their free throws, David made 6,800, I guess I could say, of his free throws, Elena made 8 10s of her free throws, and Raj made 72% of his free throws, which student made the largest proportion of their free throws? So pause this video and try to figure this out before we do this together. All right, so what's interesting about this is that they've given the proportion of free throws made in different formats, and my brain, and I think most people's brains, have an easier time doing this if we put them all in the same format. And usually, at least for me, it's easiest to put it all into a decimal format. So let's put all of these into a decimal format. So let's start with 6 8s. 6 8s, well, before I even try to express it as a decimal, I can recognize that that is the same thing as 3 4s. Both 6 and 8 are divisible by 2, so I'm gonna divide them both by 2 and I get 3 4s. And 3 4s, you might recognize, is the same thing as 0.75. David's free throw proportion is already there as a decimal. Elena's 8 10s is 0.8, or we could say 0.80 if we wanna express everything in terms of hundredths. And then, last but not least, Raj is 72%, that's 72 per hundred. 72% is 72 over a hundred, or 0.72, or 72 hundredths. So now, it's easy to compare them. It looks like David has the lowest proportion of free throws made, and then the next lowest is going to be Raj, and then the next lowest, or second to highest, is Simone, and then the highest proportion of free throws made looks like it is Elena, and we are done.
