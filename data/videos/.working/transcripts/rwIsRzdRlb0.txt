We're told Mia is doing a science experiment. She pours nine tenths liter of vinegar into a container. Then she adds three tenths of a liter of oil to the container. How much total liquid is in Mia's container? Pause this video and try to figure that out. All right, so what we really wanna do is we wanna add 0.9 liters to 0.3 liter. So let's just do that. So we are going to have 0.9, and I could put the units there if I like. And I'm going to add that to 0.3. Now when I'm going to add things, I wanna make sure that my decimals are lined up so I can add the same places to the same places. So let's get started. So we can go to the tenths place. I have nine tenths plus three tenths. That's 12 tenths. Now I can't write 12 tenths in the tenths place, but I could write that. 12 tenths is the same thing as two tenths and a whole. Or you can other way to think about it, it's the same thing as 1.2 if you have 0.9 plus 0.3. Or another way, sometimes people would say, write the two, carry the one, regroup the one. But the reason why you're doing that, this is 12 tenths, and 12 tenths is the same thing as two tenths and a whole. And then I have one whole and no other wholes, so it's just going to be one whole right over there. And then my decimals right over there, and I am done.
