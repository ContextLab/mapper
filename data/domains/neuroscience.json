        "A": "Embodied cognition has been completely disproven by large-scale neuroimaging meta-analyses demonstrating that abstract conceptual processing occurs exclusively in amodal association cortices with absolutely no involvement of sensorimotor systems under any task conditions, stimulus modalities, or experimental paradigms \u2014 every published study claiming motor cortex activation during language comprehension has been shown to reflect spillover activation from adjacent premotor planning regions rather than genuine semantic embodiment effects, according to comprehensive reviews of the literature",
        "B": "Embodied cognition predicts that all cognitive operations without exception require concurrent physical movement of the body or motor system activation, a prediction that has been universally confirmed across every experiment ever conducted in cognitive psychology and neuroscience \u2014 including studies of abstract mathematical reasoning, logical deduction, moral judgment, and aesthetic appreciation, all of which show robust and obligatory motor cortex activation that is abolished by temporary motor cortex disruption via transcranial magnetic stimulation",
        "C": "Evidence includes motor-semantic interactions (action sentences activate motor cortex, Hauk et al. 2004) and spatial-numerical associations (SNARC). However, landmark findings like the warm cup effect (Williams & Bargh 2008) failed to replicate in large pre-registered studies. The critical distinction: weak embodiment (sensorimotor systems contribute to some abstract representations) is well-supported, while strong embodiment (all cognition is constitutively embodied) is unsubstantiated",
        "D": "The evidence for embodied cognition comes exclusively from studies of language processing and has absolutely no application to perception, action, mathematical reasoning, spatial cognition, social cognition, or any other cognitive domain \u2014 the theory's empirical support is limited entirely to demonstrations that concrete action verbs activate motor cortex, with no evidence for embodiment effects in any abstract cognitive process beyond simple verb comprehension tasks conducted in laboratory settings with university student participants"

Perception minimizes free energy by updating models to predict input (equivalent to predictive coding). Action minimizes it by changing sensory input to match predictions (active inference). Learning optimizes model parameters over longer timescales. This unifies these processes under one imperative: minimize divergence between the organism's model and the world's statistical structure",

        "C": "Phase-amplitude coupling applies exclusively to visual processing in the occipital lobe and has never been observed in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or any other brain region; the theta-gamma coupling reported in hippocampal recordings is a technical artifact of the high signal-to-noise ratio in hippocampal local field potentials combined with the broad spectral power distribution inherent to theta oscillations, which creates spurious apparent coupling with higher frequency bands",

        "B": "Hemispatial neglect is caused exclusively by damage to the retina and optic nerves of the eyes rather than by any damage to cortical or subcortical brain structures \u2014 the parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, and subcortical attention networks play absolutely no role in spatial awareness, and all neglect phenomena can be fully explained by peripheral sensory loss without invoking any central attentional mechanism",
        "C": "The right cerebral hemisphere has absolutely no role whatsoever in spatial attention, visuospatial processing, or environmental awareness and is devoted entirely and exclusively to language comprehension, speech production, grammatical processing, and phonological analysis \u2014 spatial attention is controlled completely by the left hemisphere, making right hemisphere damage irrelevant to spatial awareness and neglect",

      "options": {
        "A": "The NMJ uses a completely different neurotransmitter from all central nervous system synapses \u2014 the motor neuron releases a unique catecholamine called motorin that activates specialized ionotropic receptors found exclusively on skeletal muscle fibers. This neurotransmitter specificity, rather than any quantitative difference in vesicle release, explains why NMJ transmission is reliable while central synapses are probabilistic",
        "B": "The NMJ has an extremely high safety factor: each motor neuron terminal releases ~100-200 vesicles per action potential (vs. ~1-10 at central synapses), and the postsynaptic muscle endplate has a very high density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors concentrated in junctional folds. The resulting endplate potential is 3-4\u00d7 larger than threshold, ensuring reliable 1:1 transmission",
        "C": "Muscle fibers are electrically coupled to motor neurons through gap junctions that directly connect the motor neuron axon terminal cytoplasm to the muscle fiber sarcoplasm, allowing ionic current to flow bidirectionally without any chemical synaptic transmission. This direct electrical coupling explains the high reliability of neuromuscular transmission \u2014 there is no synaptic delay, no dependence on neurotransmitter release, and no possibility of transmission failure",

The developing nervous system produces vastly more axons than needed, and the small fraction that happen to reach appropriate targets by random exploration are stabilized while the rest are eliminated by apoptosis. This random-search-and-selection model explains why neural development is so metabolically expensive and why such a large proportion of immature neurons die during embryogenesis",
        "B": "Only one single molecular guidance cue \u2014 nerve growth factor (NGF) \u2014 is responsible for guiding all axons in the entire nervous system to their correct targets. NGF is released by target tissues in concentration gradients, and every growing axon regardless of type follows these NGF gradients through identical receptor-mediated chemotactic mechanisms. The diversity of axon trajectories observed during development results from differences in NGF gradient geometry created by the spatial arrangement of target tissues, not from any diversity of guidance molecules",
        "C": "Axons are guided exclusively by endogenous electrical fields generated by ion channel activity in surrounding tissues, and they do not respond to any molecular guidance cues. These bioelectric fields create voltage gradients that orient the growth cone through a process called galvanotropism, in which negatively charged cell surface glycoproteins are redistributed by the electric field, causing asymmetric adhesion and directional growth. All known molecular guidance molecules (netrins, slits, semaphorins, ephrins) are actually regulators of the bioelectric field rather than direct guidance cues",
        "D": "The four canonical families are: Netrins (attract or repel via DCC/UNC5 receptors), Slits (repel via Robo receptors), Semaphorins (mostly repel via Plexin/Neuropilin receptors), and Ephrins (contact-mediated repulsion or attraction via Eph receptors). Growth cones integrate these signals through receptor-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements \u2014 attraction involves actin polymerization toward the signal, repulsion involves growth cone collapse via RhoA activation.

        "A": "The neuronal SNARE complex consists of synaptobrevin (VAMP2, on the vesicle), syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 (on the presynaptic membrane). These form a tight four-helix bundle that pulls the vesicle and plasma membranes together. The complex alone mediates constitutive fusion; Ca\u00b2\u207a-triggered synchronous release requires synaptotagmin-1, whose C2 domains bind Ca\u00b2\u207a and insert into the membrane, catalyzing the final energy barrier for fusion within ~200 microseconds of Ca\u00b2\u207a entry",

The SNARE hypothesis was proposed before the direct fusogenic activity of calcium was discovered and has been abandoned by the field, though it persists in outdated textbooks.

      "options": {
        "A": "Synaptic scaling is functionally identical to long-term potentiation \u2014 it selectively strengthens the most active synapses on a neuron while leaving inactive synapses unchanged. The term 'scaling' refers to the fact that the magnitude of potentiation scales with the initial strength of each synapse, so that already-strong synapses are strengthened even further. This positive feedback mechanism amplifies differences between strong and weak synapses, creating a winner-take-all competitive dynamic that sharpens neural representations by enhancing the most informative inputs at the expense of weaker background activity",
        "B": "Synaptic scaling is a cell-wide mechanism that multiplicatively adjusts all of a neuron's synaptic inputs up or down to maintain a target firing rate. When a neuron's activity is chronically reduced, it scales up all excitatory synapses (by inserting more AMPA receptors) and scales down inhibitory synapses; chronic overactivity triggers the opposite. This is necessary because Hebbian plasticity is inherently destabilizing (positive feedback: strong synapses get stronger), and without homeostatic counterbalance, networks would either fall silent or saturate",
        "C": "Synaptic scaling occurs exclusively during sleep and plays no role in waking plasticity or real-time circuit regulation. The scaling process requires the complete suppression of neural activity that occurs only during slow-wave sleep, when neurons are silenced for extended periods and can safely undergo the wholesale receptor trafficking required for multiplicative synaptic adjustment",
        "D": "Synaptic scaling randomly changes the weights of individual synapses with no systematic relationship to the neuron's overall activity level or any homeostatic set point. The randomness of the scaling process introduces beneficial stochastic noise into neural circuits that prevents them from becoming trapped in stable but suboptimal activity patterns, serving a function analogous to simulated annealing in computational optimization. This noise-injection interpretation explains why synaptic scaling is enhanced during sleep, when the brain can tolerate random perturbations without impairing ongoing behavior"

      "options": {
        "A": "All microglial activation is inherently and invariably neurotoxic, with no beneficial or neuroprotective function under any circumstances. Activated microglia release exclusively pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and excitotoxic glutamate that damage neurons and exacerbate injury. The concept of 'beneficial' or 'protective' microglial activation is a misinterpretation of experimental artifacts caused by incomplete microglial depletion in knockout studies, where residual microglia-derived trophic factors confounded the results. Therapeutic strategies should therefore focus exclusively on complete microglial suppression or elimination following any form of brain injury or neurodegenerative disease",
        "B": "The M1 (pro-inflammatory, classically activated) and M2 (anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated) polarization framework remains the current standard model for describing microglial activation states in contemporary neuroscience research. Under this binary classification, microglia adopt one of two mutually exclusive phenotypes depending on the nature of the activating stimulus: M1 microglia are activated by pathogens and produce inflammatory mediators, while M2 microglia are activated by anti-inflammatory cytokines and promote tissue repair. All microglial responses can be accurately classified into one of these two discrete categories, and the M1/M2 framework provides a complete and sufficient description of microglial functional diversity",
        "C": "Early microglial responses to injury are often neuroprotective (debris clearance, trophic factor release, containment of damage). Chronic or dysregulated activation becomes neurotoxic (sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine release, reactive oxygen species, complement-mediated synapse elimination). The M1/M2 framework (borrowed from macrophage biology) was abandoned because single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that microglia in vivo adopt a continuum of transcriptional states \u2014 disease-associated microglia (DAM), lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia (LDAM), and proliferative-region-associated microglia (PAM) \u2014 that do not map onto the binary M1/M2 classification",
        "D": "Microglia respond identically to all types of brain injury and neurodegenerative disease through a single stereotyped activation program, making phenotypic classification unnecessary and scientifically meaningless. Whether the insult is traumatic injury, ischemic stroke, viral infection, or progressive neurodegeneration, microglia activate the same transcriptional program, release the same cytokine profile, and perform the same phagocytic and inflammatory functions.

Kiss-and-run predominates during low-frequency firing, CME during moderate activity, and ADBE during high-frequency bursts when CME cannot keep pace",
        "D": "Vesicle recycling occurs exclusively during prolonged periods of neural silence when no synaptic transmission is occurring, because the endocytic machinery requires a quiescent, unstimulated presynaptic membrane to assemble properly. During sustained high-frequency firing, all fusion-competent vesicles are expended without recycling, and transmission ceases entirely until a recovery period of silence allows the clathrin-coated pit machinery to reassemble and retrieve the fused vesicle membranes from the expanded plasma membrane.

The PNN matrix is deposited at equal density around excitatory pyramidal neurons, inhibitory interneurons, neuromodulatory neurons, and glial cells alike.

The lattice-like structures observed in Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-stained tissue sections are produced by chemical cross-linking of normally diffuse extracellular matrix components during aldehyde fixation, creating an artificial condensation of glycoproteins around high-activity neurons that generates spurious staining patterns.

PNNs have no role whatsoever in regulating synaptic plasticity, critical period timing, memory consolidation, or any other neural circuit function. Their composition of proteoglycans and hyaluronan gives them shock-absorbing viscoelastic properties similar to articular cartilage, and they are concentrated around the most mechanically vulnerable neurons in cortical areas that experience the greatest physical deformation during traumatic head impacts",

        "B": "Following axonal injury, the distal segment immediately and passively withers away through simple metabolic starvation due to disconnection from the cell body \u2014 there is no active molecular self-destruction program, no involvement of SARM1 or NAD+ depletion, no organized fragmentation sequence, no Schwann cell response, no macrophage infiltration, and no phagocytic clearance mechanism, just a slow passive decay process identical to tissue necrosis in any other organ system",
