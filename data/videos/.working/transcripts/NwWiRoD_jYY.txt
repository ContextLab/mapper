It's real life money puzzles, the surprise game show. Our host, Kevin Sizemanski, is somewhere in this home, just waiting for Bobby, our unwitting contestant, to make a classic money blunder. He's on the phone with his mother. Bobby, hon, if you're not happy, then you gotta come up with the way out of it. Your father and I can't help you. For one thing, you're too far away. And for another, this isn't something we have the ability to fix. I just feel like I don't have enough money for things that I need, let alone things that I want. So you keep telling me. And when I do get money, it just feels like it evaporates immediately. Money always finds somewhere to go sweetheart, but you gotta get your finances in order. If you're not happy in how you're managing your money, you need to come up with a plan. Okay, I resolved to save more money. How does that sound? Is that a plan? Yeah. Eh! It sounds wrong, Bobby. What the heck? Were you hiding in my refrigerator? I sure was. How long have you been in there? Long enough to hear you get off on the wrong financial foot, my boy. You've got a real life money puzzle on your hands. Oh my gosh. Is that Kevin Sizmansky? Bobby, baby, put me on speakerphone. Kevin, Kevin, I love your books. Hi, Maria. He knows my name. Bobby, I hate to tell you this, especially with your mother on the phone, but you're not being very smart about your goal right now. Wow, rude. You misunderstand me, Robert. A smart goal must be S, specific. M, measurable. A, achievable. R, relevant. And T, time bound, if it's gonna be successful. Let's play back what you said, all right? Okay, I resolved to save more money. What in the name of, were you recording me? Specific, a good goal needs to be granular. Don't say I resolved to save more money. Start by something specific you wanna do with the money. Bobby, what's something you wanna do with your money? Take a vacation. Atta boy. To where? Toledo. Now, measurable. How much money do you wanna save for your trip to Toledo? Mm, really splash out a big trip. I could really go for some paprikash at Peko's. Not sponsored, not sponsored. So good though. Let's say $1,000. Folks, that's a lot of paprikash. Now, achievable. What's your take home pay? I get about 1,500 bucks per paycheck, twice a month. And your rent is how much? $900 a month. So how much do you think you could save per paycheck for this trip without cutting into rent, food, day-to-day expenses? I guess $50. That feels achievable to me. Next, relevant. Do you eat out a lot? I don't know, three times a week? It feels expensive. Should I cut it out entirely? Only if it feels relevant. You deserve to have a nice life. That's what money is for. If you need to reduce your spending to save up for the trip, do it. But only as much as you have to in order to meet your goal. So maybe once or twice a week instead. That's my feeling. Otherwise you're just robbing yourself now to pay yourself later. Think about why you're setting the goal and limit yourself to what you need to do to achieve it. Finally, time bound. Set a time by which you'll achieve this goal. You already said you wanted to save $1,000 and you'll set aside $50 from each paycheck. So 20 paychecks from now, you'll have saved 1,000 bucks. Let's say 10 months from now. That works for me if it works for you, Bobby. Now say all of that back to me again. What's your smart goal? Smart guy. In order to save for a trip to Toledo, I'm going to save $50 per paycheck for the next 10 months for a total of $1,000 limiting my restaurant meals to twice a week during that time. Great work, Bobby. Now for round two, Maria. Oh my God, I'm on the show. We'll get to your smart goals right after this lesson. Bobby got his goal and now it's your turn. Think about something you want to achieve with your money and make it smart, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound. Give yourself the best chance to succeed because financial freedom starts with planning and it ends with Paprakash or whatever's a priority for you.
