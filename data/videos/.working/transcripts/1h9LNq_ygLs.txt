Hi teachers, Sal here. Welcome to the unit on employment. So what's covered here? Well, I think many of us, I don't know if you fall into this category, but I remember the first time that I had a job and they made me fill out all of these forms when I took that job on the first or second day on how many children do I have and things like that. I'm like, why are they asking me all of these things? And what are all the different ways they might pay me? Or what is even the difference between an employee and say a contractor? And then I start working and then I start getting paychecks. And I was very disappointed by how much I thought I was going to make and how much I actually get in terms of cash. And so that's what this unit covers. It will help your students understand the process of, well, what are the types of employment are there? There's traditional being an employee, but there's also more non-traditional employment. What are the types of forms that you will fill out when you take a job so that you can go into it fully informed? And then when you start to get paid, what should you expect? And how should you read that pay stub to make sure that everything makes sense and frankly, you're getting paid what you should be getting paid.
