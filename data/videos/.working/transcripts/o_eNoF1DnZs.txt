We're on 121. 121. It says if x over 2 is equal to 3 over y is x less than y. So this is interesting that x times y is equal to 6. I just cross multiplied. Or you could do that step by step, multiply both sides by 2, then multiply both sides by y. And you get xy is equal to 6. And they want to know whether x is less than y. Statement 1 says y is greater than or equal to 3. So what does that mean? So let's think about this. x is equal to 6 divided by y. If y is greater than or equal to 3, that's the largest that x can be. If y is any larger number, then x will only be smaller. So x will be less than or equal to 6 over 3. Or x will be less than or equal to 2. And I want you to understand why I said that. Think about this. It says y is greater than or equal to 3. If y is 3, x is going to be 2. If y is 4, x is going to be 1 and 1.5. If y is 6, x is going to be 1. So the highest value for x happens when y is equal to 3. And then as y gets larger and larger, x just gets smaller. So y being greater than or equal to 3 says that x is less than or equal to 2. So statement 1 alone is sufficient to say that x is less than y. If x is less than 2 and y is greater than 3, then x is definitely less than y. Statement 2 tells us y is less than or equal to 4. So this is interesting. It's really just the inverse of this statement right here. Now you're saying instead of y being greater than a certain number, y is less than a certain number. So if you think about it this way, so let's just go back to this equation. So x is going to be, if y is 4, x is going to be, so let's do a little table. y, x. If y is equal to 4, x is equal to 1.5. If y is equal to 3, x is equal to 2. If y is equal to 2, then x is equal to 3. So actually this constraint, I can pick a bunch of different y's that meet this constraint, but it still doesn't tell me about anything whether x is greater than or less than y. Here x is less than y, and here x is greater than y. So this statement is useless. So statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer this question, and statement 2 doesn't help us much. 122. If v and w are different integers, does v equal 0? Does v equal 0? Different integers. Remember it says different. They say that v, w is equal to v squared. Now let's think about this. If this doesn't tell me for sure that v is equal to 0, and in fact, as long as, well, let's think about this. The only way that this could be true is if v is equal to 0. That's one case. Now if v does not equal to 0, so if we assume that's one case, so if v does not equal to 0, then this case implies what? That w equals v. Think about it. If v doesn't equal 0, we can divide both sides by v, because we know we're not dividing by 0. You divide both sides by v, you get, on the left hand side, because this v cancels out, and then v squared divided by v, you get v. Well, I want to be careful here though, because w would have to equal v. And they already told us that w and v are two different numbers, so we know that this situation, if w equals v, then v does not equal 0. But they tell us in the problem statement that w and v are two different integers. They tell us that w does not equal v. So we know that the only way that this could be satisfied if w does not equal v is if v is equal to 0. So statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer this question. Statement 2, w is equal to 2. w is equal to 2. Well, that doesn't do anything for me. I mean, w could be 2 and v could be 0, or v could be 3. All they told us was that v and w are different integers and that they don't equal each other. So this doesn't help me at all in determining whether v is equal to 0. So statement 1 alone is sufficient. I just want to make sure I got that first part right. I mean, the only way that this is true, this is true if v is equal to 0, or it's true if w is equal to v. Either of those cases are true. That's the only way it works. And we know w does not equal v, so v has to be equal to 0. What are we on? 123. What is the value of 36,500 times 1.05 to the nth power? All right. Statement number 1 tells us n squared minus 5n plus 6 is equal to 0. So we could solve for n. There'll be two solutions. So this is n minus 2 times n minus 3. I just factored. I said, what two numbers, when I multiply them equal positive 6, so I said minus 2 minus 3. And when you add them, become minus 5. That's why I picked the minuses as opposed to plus 2 and plus 3 or some other combination. Equals 0. So statement 1 tells us that n is equal to 2 or n is equal to 3. So statement 1 by itself isn't enough, because I don't know whether I should put a 2 here or a 3 here. So I can't determine this value just yet. Statement 2 tells us n minus 2 does not equal 0. This statement by itself is fairly useless, because this just tells me that n does not equal 2. So n could be any other number, so I don't know what number to put here. But used in conjunction, these two statements, statement 1 says n is either 2 or 3. Statement 2 says, well, it's not 2. So if you use both of these together, we know that n is equal to 3. And then we could obviously solve this problem, taking 1.05 to the third power and multiplying by 36,500, which I won't do, because it would be a waste of time. 124. In the rectangular coordinate system above, let me draw that. The y-axis, they have the x-axis, and they draw on a triangle. I'll do it in a different color. Like that. The letters are o, p, and q. In the rectangular coordinate system above, if o, p is less than p, q. So o, p is less than p, q. Let me write that down. o, p is less than p, q. Is the area of o, p, q greater than 48? So we want to know is area greater than 48? o, p is less than p, q. So the way I drew this actually isn't right. It's probably a little bit shifted to the left a little bit. But fair enough. We can visualize. We can imagine that. So let's see. Statement number 1. The coordinates of point p are 6, 8. So this is 6, 8. Let's see. That tells us the height. When we figure out the area of a triangle, we need to know the base times the height, and then multiply that times 1.5. This tells us that the height, because the height of this triangle is the y-coordinate, which is 8. So the altitude of this triangle is 8. So we have the height, but we still don't know the distance from o to q. So statement 1 by itself isn't much information. So that tells us that the point was 6, 8. p was 6, 8. Statement 2 says the coordinates of point q are 13, 0. Well, this is helpful. 13, 0. So this distance right here is 13. So by itself, that's useless. Because if I didn't have the height, I still wouldn't be able to figure out the area of this triangle. But now if I use both statements, I know the base times the height. So the area is going to be the base times the height times 1.5. So 8 times 1.5 is 4 times 13 is 52. And so 52 is clearly greater than 48. Let me make sure that, because I didn't use this information at all. But it doesn't. Let's see. Let me think about it. Actually, no. I think I'm wrong. I think statement 1 alone might be enough. Let's assume that we don't have, see these are tricky. Let's assume that we don't have statement 2 there. Let me see if I can figure out whether the area is greater than 48 without it. Yeah, I think I'm wrong. Let me, yeah, I caught myself. OK, so if this is 6, 8, the area of this triangle right here is going to be 6, right? This distance right here is 6, 6, 8, right. OK, so the area of this triangle is 6 times 8, 48 times 1.5. So the area of this triangle is 24, right? But they told us that OP is less than PQ, that this distance is less than this distance. Maybe I should draw it like that so you can kind of see it. And the only way that this distance is less than this distance is if this distance is less than this distance. This is a tricky problem, right? This has to be less than this. Q has to be further away because that's the only way you're going to get this altitude to be longer than this altitude, right? Because you're assuming that Q is along the axis. So that's the only thing that you can shift back and forth. So if this distance is larger than this distance, then the area of this triangle is going to be at least 24. So the area is going to be greater than 48. So actually, all you needed was statement one to solve this problem. That's all you needed. Statement one gave you enough information. Statement two does not by itself give you enough information because you don't know how high P is. It could be really low down here in which case the area is going to be less than 48. It could be really high in which case the area would be greater than 48. But anyway, see, I almost got that one wrong. But I'll leave you there. I'll see you in the next video. Statement one alone was sufficient for this one. See you soon.
