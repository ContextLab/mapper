Let's give ourselves a little bit more practice with logarithms. So just as a little bit of review, let's evaluate log base 2 of 8. What does this evaluate to? Well, it's asking us, or it will evaluate, to the power, or the exponent, that I have to raise our base to, that I have to raise 2 to, to get to 8. So 2 to the first power is 2, 2 to the second power is 4, 2 to the third power is 8. So this right over here is going to be equal to 3. Fair enough. We did examples like that in the last video. Let's do something a little bit more interesting. What is, and I'll color code it, what is log base 8? What is log base 8 of 2? Now, this is interesting. I'll give you a few seconds to think about it. Well, we're asking ourselves, or this will evaluate to, the exponent that I have to raise 8 to, to get to 2. So let's think about that in another way. So we could say 8 to some power, and that exponent that I'm raising 8 to is essentially what this logarithm would evaluate to. 8 to some power is going to be equal to 2. Well, if 2 to the third power is 8, 8 to the 1 third power is equal to 2. So x is equal to 1 third. 8 to the 1 third power is equal to 2. You could say the cube root of 8 is 2. So in this case, x is 1 third. This logarithm right over here will evaluate 2. Will evaluate to 1 third. Fascinating. Let's mix it up a little bit more. Let's say we had the log base 2. Instead of 8, let's put a 1 eighth right over here. So I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. Well, it's asking us, or this will evaluate to the exponent that I have to raise 2 to to get to 1 eighth. So if we said that this is equal to x, we're essentially saying 2 to the x power is equal to 1 eighth. Well, we know 2 to the third power. Let me write this down. We already know that 2 to the third power is equal to 8. If we want to get to 1 eighth, which is a reciprocal of 8, we just have to raise 2 to the negative 3 power. 2 to the negative 3 power is 1 over 2 to the third power, which is the same thing as 1 over 8. So if we're asking ourselves, what exponent do we have to raise 2 to to get to 1 eighth? Well, we have to raise it to the negative 3 power. So x is equal to negative 3. This logarithm evaluates to negative 3. Now let's really, really mix it up. What would be the log base 8 of 1 1-half? What does this evaluate to? Let me clean this up so that we have some space to work with. So as always, we're saying what power do we have to raise 8 to to get to 1-half? So let's think about that a little bit. We already know that 8 to the 1 third power is equal to 2. If we want the reciprocal of 2 right over here, we have to just raise 8 to the negative 1 third. So let me write that down. 8 to the negative 1 third power is going to be equal to 1 over 8 to the 1 third power. And we already know the cube root of 8 or 8 to the 1 third power is equal to 2. This is equal to 1 half. So the log base 8 of 1 half is equal to, well, the power after I raise 8 to to get to 1 half is negative 1 third. I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.
