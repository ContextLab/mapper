The Khan Academy is most known for what's now about a thousand videos on YouTube. It starts literally at one plus one equals two and it goes all the way up to the college level calculus and physics. Everything is in these very short encapsulated videos one concept at a time. My cousin Nadia was visiting me from New Orleans when I was in Boston and she was having trouble with math. She was in sixth grade at the time. I agreed to do this remote tutoring with her so I started putting up videos on YouTube and before I knew it random people all over the world started watching them and sending me letters and testimonials and I started getting excited about it and I just kept going. I think I've learned more about math in the past three weeks than I had in all four years of my high school study. When you watch them you just comprehend everything you just get it. I ended up passing a whole bunch of tests from his videos. One thing that kind of shocked me I get a lot of letters from the Middle East I get a lot of letters from Latin America, Ethiopia, and Gondar. It's really reached far more students than I could have ever imagined. Right now there are about a thousand videos. I started recording about three years ago and now I'm doing it full-time. I'm hoping to be able to put out a couple hundred videos a year. I see a world where literally anyone with access to a computer in the internet will be able to go to the Khan Academy and get a world-class education. It will be the world's free virtual school.
