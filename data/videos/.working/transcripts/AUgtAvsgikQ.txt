So let's go ahead and start with introductions. My name is Frances Barreto. I'm a district success manager here at Khan Academy. I work closely with district and school leaders to support the effective implementation of Khan Academy and Khanmigo. Also joining us is my colleague Victoria Chang, who will be monitoring the chat today. So we would love for you to drop your name, your role, district in the chat. And along the way throughout the session, feel free to put any questions or comments that you have in there. This is going to be brief but packed. So if you want to go deeper into any of the topics or things that we covered today, please reach out to your DSM or your professional learning specialist. And we would be happy to schedule something. If you're not sure who your DSM is, just drop your name, your district, an email in the chat, and Victoria can help connect you. All right. So in today's session, we're going to explore how both teachers and students can use Khanmigo tools and embedded supports. Because as instructional leaders, we want you to understand these resources so that you can leverage these tools to help coach and empower your educators. So let's get started by dropping in the chat. Which of these teaching strategies would you enable district or school-wide tomorrow if you had a magic wand? Which of these would be the which one would you pick? Let's see. Yep. Differentiation. That's super important. The planning piece, being able to make sure that we're standards aligned and we're engaging students. Yep. Creating those clear directions and scaffolds. Absolutely. Well, the great news is that Khanmigo can help teachers do all of these things while saving time. So let's go ahead and get started with an overview of our Khanmigo teacher tools. And you guys are also going to be able to engage in an interactive activity as part of this section. So there are currently 27 Khanmigo teacher tools. All of our teacher tools are created by educators for educators. And we are continuously improving them based on the feedback that we're getting from all of you, our district partners. Our newest tool, the Blooker Generator, was added thanks to your input and feedback. Tools are organized into five color-coded categories. We have the plan tools, the create tools, the differentiate tools, the support tools, and the learn tools. Teachers are also able to mark their favorite tools. And that way, they only see those when they first log in to their main menu. So that's another way that teachers are able to organize. So one thing that sets Khanmigo apart is that teachers always remain in control. Think of it as a smart, supportive teaching assistant. It is not a replacement. Teachers are able to edit. They're able to code draft. They're able to export to Word, PDF, Google Drive, OneDrive. Some tools even allow teachers to export to Google Forms. There's also a share link that teachers are able to use to send out to their teams, to their colleagues, so that you guys can have some cross-team collaboration as well. So what we would love to do is now give you some time to explore some of these tools. As you're exploring, I want you to consider these two questions. Number one is, which tool are you going, are you most excited to go back and share with teachers, and why? And the other thing that I want you to think about as you're exploring the tools is, which tool will help you the most in planning or in admin tasks that you engage with daily? So Victoria is going to drop a link in the chat that's going to have a handout that will help guide you through this activity. And we're going to come back in six minutes. And when we come back in six minutes, we'd love for you to be able to either drop in the chat or come off mute and share, again, which tool you're most excited about to share with teachers or which tool you're most excited about using for your own professional admin tasks. All right. Thanks. And feel free to ask questions at any point. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, team. If we can come back to the chat or if you prefer to unmute, who would like to share out what was a tool that you found would be helpful or useful to make sure that your teachers know about or a tool that maybe you're excited to explore further and use for your own professional tasks? Thank you. The discussion topic tool. Excellent. And it looks like you guys did some interacting with it. So I'm glad to see that. Once again, that's one of the great things that I love about Commeigo is that you're able to interact and highlight and say, hey, I don't like this. I like this. I need it to be more like this, more like that. I need this to be adjusted to support English language learners. Or I need to support this. I have a student that has an IEP and needs these certain accommodations. Please adjust this so that it can help support those students. So again, the more input, the more details, the more information, and the more that you interact and go back and forth and prompt Commeigo, the more Commeigo is going to be able to tailor and make that final product fit best what you need. Discussion prompts. Absolutely. Yes. And those discussion prompts can really help not only with the instructional part, but thinking about classroom management as well. If we keep students engaged, our classroom management is going to be better and more effective. And so these tools can also directly and indirectly help support with that as well, in addition to providing those either scaffold off grade level or on grade level or above grade level for students that may need that or have that. Excellent. Thank you for everybody that shared. All right. So now we are going to shift focus to the student side of Commeigo. There are several embedded supports designed to help students engage more deeply and independently in their learning. And so we're going to get to explore some of these the rest of our time together. So many of you have used or seen Khan Academy as a learning resource, whether as a former educator or maybe as a parent with your own kids or maybe you've used it for your own personal learning. But now with Commeigo, it takes that foundation and it takes that content and it adds a powerful layer of support for students right within their learning experience and provides those just in time scaffolds and supports that our students need. Commeigo is specifically designed to be a powerful tool in the teacher's toolbox to be able to provide, again, those just in time scaffolds and supports that are needed for a wide range and diverse learners with different instructional priorities within that same classroom. So now we're going to take a closer look at some of Commeigo's settings and features. So with Commeigo, students are able to adjust the language, the tone and the complexity level so that they can make their experience with Commeigo customizable and tailored to their preferences. It is going to default to simple for reading style, but there are two other settings that have more depth complexity that can be adjusted. But for the most part, simple is going to work best for everybody. Officially, we do have Commeigo in English, Spanish, Hindi and Portuguese. However, Commeigo is able to support in many other languages as well. But for us to be able to claim that it is officially multilingual, it is in those four languages. And then finally, the voice. Commeigo has some different voices that the students can set it to. So here's just an example of what it would look like. Even if a student doesn't change the setting, if a student types into Commeigo in Spanish, Commeigo is going to know and it's going to automatically respond back to that student in Spanish or in whatever language the student inputs that question. In terms of the voices, this is because there are some accessibility features built in such as text to speech and speech to text. So when the students hear Commeigo, that's why they're able to personalize that. There's also the built in calculator and students, I mean, I'm sorry, teachers have the availability and the functionality to do the app feature where they can specifically look for specific like student data or student specific things. So with our Commeigo learner activities, currently there are 22 student facing learner activities available in Commeigo. We're not going to have time to explore all of them today, but I do highly encourage you to explore them after the session or when you have time or with your teachers as part of a staff meeting or PLC, because there are some really great things here specifically for those secondary folks. There are some tools that are very specific to college prep. And we're going to go ahead and actually focus though on a handful of those. And one of the ones is companion mode for students. So this is a powerful way that students can use Commeigo when teachers assign aligned practice exercises that is complementing the instruction and what's going on in the classroom. Students can work toward mastery and proficiency with Commeigo by their side. Support with practice exercises includes these dynamic action bubbles, right? So the students are going to be given these sort of sentence stems, help me solve this, try a similar example, why should I care about learning this? Of course, that's the age old question that kids ask, as well as kids can just ask any question as they're working through the content. Similarly if students are on our videos or our articles, they can also pull up Commeigo and Commeigo is going to know exactly what exercise, what video, what article they are on and Commeigo is going to be able to provide that support and scaffolding that is specific to that particular skill. With the videos, students are also able to enable the closed captioning and they can enable closed captioning in different languages, not just English. This of course is something that can be beneficial to our multilingual learners, especially if they're listening to the video in English and they have the closed captioning in their native language, it can help bridge some of those comprehension language gaps. There's also access to a transcript of the video. The transcript can also be available in other languages, there is a way through the settings which we'll cover here shortly, where students can actually change the setting language of Khan Academy and it'll change the language of the whole platform and the videos, articles, and so on. The next tool that I'd like to talk about is Writing Coach. This is a game changer. It really helps students with not only providing support for the full essay, but we have recently in the last two weeks added a feature where now teachers and students can also get feedback and revision support for pre-written drafts. If they don't want to use Khanmigo for the whole full writing process, maybe they've worked on something in class with their teacher, with their peers, and they want to be able to submit that pre-written draft to Khanmigo to get specific actionable feedback and be able to revise that, they are now able to do that as well, both from the teacher side, so teachers can assign that as an assignment or a task for our students, or the students can go directly to Writing Coach and input that. In addition to that, teachers are going to get the Writing Coach Insights report and so this is going to allow teachers to be able to see not only originality flags to ensure that students' writing is authentic, if they're using the full essay portion of Writing Coach, they're going to be able to see that chat history. They're going to be able to see, as you can see here on the screen, what does that interaction between the student and Khanmigo look like? As I said, Khan Academy has over 50 languages to choose from for the actual platform and content within Khan Academy, and so at any time, teachers and students can go into their settings and change their primary language. If a user is under 13, then a teacher can do that, if not, the students have to go in their settings and do that themselves. All right, so what Khanmigo tool or feature are you most excited for your students to explore and why? It doesn't have to be one of the ones that we went over. It could be any of the 22 learner activity tools available. Which one is one that really excites you and one that you want to make sure your teachers are encouraging their students to use? Yes, the writing tutor and homework helper, absolutely. Debate and play seem to have a lot of potential, yes, and with the debate tool, there's elementary, middle and high school versions of that. Writing coach, absolutely. I want to go back and be a writing teacher just like writing coach in the classroom. TutorMe is such a powerful tool, absolutely. You've got the TutorMe math and science and you've got the TutorMe humanities. It's very powerful because students can use that with any content, anything that they need help and support within those content areas with Khanmigo will be there to help and support them 24 seven students have access to this. Awesome. Thank you for sharing in the chat. All right, so that brings our time to a close. We have two more learning workshop sessions. The next one will be April 24th. We're going to focus on providing all of our summer learning resources and just talking through and guiding you through what are some purposeful and intentional ways that you can include and integrate Khan Academy's resources and Khanmigo's resources into your summer learning plans. And then we will wrap up this year's sessions with our May 8th celebrating student success. If you could take a minute to please scan this QR code and leave us some feedback. We'd love to know how we did and what else you would like to see as we plan sessions for school year 2526. As always, we are here to help and support in any way that we can. Please do not hesitate to reach out to your district success manager and or your professional learning specialist. If you'd like to connect with us and go over any of this information in greater detail. Thank you, Chris. Thank you.
