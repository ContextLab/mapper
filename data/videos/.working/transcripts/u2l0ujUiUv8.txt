Khan Academy is excited to share our latest tool for writing instruction, Khanmigo Writing Coach. Designed by teachers to emphasize the writing process as much as the writing product, Writing Coach is an AI-enabled instructional tool with the purpose of producing better writers. Let's take a look at how it works. To get started, students can either fill in the assignment details themselves or click Begin Assignment for an essay assigned by their teacher. The first stage of the Writing Coach experience is understanding the assignment. Here, Khanmigo helps the student break down the essay prompt and instructions, answers questions about key terms, and supports the student in developing a plan to get started. Next, students complete their outline. The outline structure is flexible to accommodate different essay types and formats, and Khanmigo is there to guide the student as they organize their ideas. Before students move on to drafting, Khanmigo will also check their work to make sure the student's outline is aligned to the assignment's requirements. When it's time to begin drafting, students have easy access to their outline and can copy and paste ideas directly into their draft. If they get stuck or want to make sure they're on the right track, Khanmigo is there to give them guidance without doing their work for them. Like all Khanmigo student experiences, chats and other Writing Coach interactions are captured for teacher review and insights, so teachers will be notified of any interactions that may indicate plagiarism. When it's time to move on to revising, Khanmigo will check again to ensure that the student's first draft is ready for feedback. Khanmigo then generates specific, actionable, grade-level-appropriate feedback in areas like claim and introduction, essay structure and organization, how well arguments are supported, and even the style and tone. Students can view the feedback, ask for clarifications or examples, make revisions, and then request more reviews. When students are done revising, they can export their final draft to Google Drive or save it as a PDF or Word document to be shared in their LMS. While students are working, teachers can view a class assignment report with visibility into each student's writing process, summaries of class and student-level feedback, reports on time spent at each stage of writing, and chat exchanges with Khanmigo. Teachers can also review any feedback provided by Khanmigo throughout the writing process. Teachers can also see originality flags and zoom in on an individual student's full chat, outlining, drafting, and revising processes for deeper insights into where students may have struggled or excelled.
