What fraction of this circle is shaded red? So let's see, this circle is divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight equal parts. And of those eight equal parts, seven are shaded red. So we can say that seven out of eight are shaded red. And this isn't how we've traditionally seen fractions when we've written them. When we've written them, we've written it like this. We have written seven over eight are shaded red. And actually, let me do it in that color, although I don't have an exact, let me get closer to an actual red color. So we could literally say seven out of, and we need a gray color, was the non-shaded seven. Out of a total eight are shaded red. That's how we're used to seeing it. Usually when we type it in, there's no way to write the seven over the eight. So instead, we write seven over eight are shaded red, or seven out of eight. So let's do that, go back to what we were doing. So seven out of eight are shaded red. Let's check our answer. Let's do two more of these. What fraction of the bar is shaded red? So the bar has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine equal sections. And eight of them are shaded red. So we can say that eight out of nine are shaded red, or eight ninths, or eight over nine. Let's do one more. What fraction of this circle is shaded red? So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine equal sections. Did I count that right? Let me count again. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine equal sections. And of those, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven are shaded red. So seven out of nine, or seven ninths, are shaded red.
