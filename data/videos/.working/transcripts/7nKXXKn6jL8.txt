So I'm here with Sean Logan, who's the Director of College Counseling at Phillips Andover Academy in Jim Ventre. Ventre, am I pronouncing it right, Jim? Ventre, yes. Ventre, who's the Director of Admissions and Financial Aid at Phillips Andover. And what we're hoping to talk or start talking about in this video is really just the financial aid process, and in particular the FAFSA. So I guess I should probably do that in all caps. My first question for either of you is, I guess, what is the FAFSA and what does it actually stand for? Right. So the FAFSA is the free application for federal student aid. And it's really important for students to realize that free part of this name, because there is an opportunity to get on the web and go to FAFSA.com, and somebody will happily help you with it, but you need to pay for it. So the first thing we talk with students a lot about is the FAFSA is a free form. You should not be paying for it. And the title, again, it's by the federal government. They use a rubric to sort of figure out, based on this form, how much your family should contribute to a college education. And did I get the answer? It's free application for federal student aid? Student, yes. Student aid. And just to hit the point home of what you just said, it should absolutely be free. And there are places where people will charge you to kind of optimize it or fill it out for you? That's correct. So the first thing, normally when you start to type in, if you type in on a search engine, FAFSA, a lot of times FAFSA.com pops up. It's a legitimate site, but they charge you something like 80, $85 to help you fill out the form. So you want to go to FAFSA.ed.gov to start this process. And there it will be free. And what is, when you fill out this form, and in future videos we'll actually take a look at the form itself, but what, I guess, what do you input into it and what comes out of it and who uses that information? I think for many students who are applying to college right now, they are accustomed to telling their story in essays and in various pieces of their application. And they have to think of the FAFSA as just their family's financial story. And their financial story has many variables, but most importantly, the things that the FAFSA asked for are simplified as things that would be questions that students could probably answer right off the top of their head in terms of their family income and whether they own a home or whether they rent where they live. It's things like that. And I remember filling this, and we were talking about this before, I guess, clicking record. All of us, I guess, were significant recipients of financial aid, of need-based financial aid. And I remember filling it out. I remember I kind of had my mom's tax form, which I had to fill out for right before filling out the FAFSA. Exactly. But that's essentially, I remember, at least this was in the early 90s, kind of the inputs that I needed to be able to fill out most of the form. And that's correct. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that, you know, specifically looking at and working with a lot of low-income families, one of the things to realize is that it generally is actually a pretty simple form because there aren't a lot of things that make it complicated. There aren't trust funds. There aren't investments. There aren't probably, a lot of times, sometimes there are homes that are owned, but a lot of times they're just renting. Usually it's a paycheck that comes in, and it's sort of a standard paycheck that comes in for the year. So it's actually a pretty simple form. It's just getting students to step up and do it is the real challenge. And the reason, obviously, it's pretty obvious why they care about income. That's kind of just the total amount of money your family's making. But then the reason why they care about things like home ownership, and if I remember properly, you know, they ask things about the number of siblings you have. And they try to understand your family's expenses too, and the whole reason is to kind of figure out their ability to pay for college. That's right. So at the outset, students are asked questions to fill out in their families' financial circumstances. And basically what the colleges are trying to do is come to a conclusion which allows them to have a picture of what the family is up against every month, every week, and what's left in the bank, so to speak, at the end of all the family operating expenses. And so what, after you fill out the form, you know, where does that go? This is at the Department of Education site, but do they process it, or do they just give the form to the universities? What happens after that? Yeah, that's a great point, Sal. I think one of the misperceptions about the FAFSA is I'm going to submit this form to the government, basically, and then they're going to crunch all these numbers, and then they're going to determine a financial aid package for my family. I think that's a really common misperception. What the FAFSA, all the FAFSA does is it looks at, again, your family's income, number of kids in the family, other assets, those sorts of things, and it determines an estimated family contribution. What a college does with that varies greatly, and I think that's something that, you know, families need to understand. So all it is going to do is determine a number. That number might mean, you know, your family should be able to contribute $1,000 towards your son or daughter's education, $5,000, or $0, for that matter. But that's all it does. I see. And the reason why this, I guess, exists is so that colleges would have a somewhat uniform way of looking at this, and they can feel good that the data is, I guess, real. That's right. And so one of the things in this estimated family contribution is sort of this sense that the family is self-reporting where they stand in their family circumstances financially. And one of the things we want to caution about is that when you receive a sort of estimated family contribution, or what they call the EFC, you want to make sure that's in line with your expectations, because sometimes that number can seem odd to the family when they understand where it came from, and they may have made a mistake in some way on the form. I see. But then that estimated family contribution, then that gets sent to the universities that you have, usually at this point, have gotten admission to. Well, it will go to every university ahead of time. So, you know, if a student applies to seven schools, you're going to want it there well before decisions come out. They're usually very strict deadlines to get things there in time. But then, usually what happens in an admissions office is if, you know, Sal, if I'm rooting your application in the admissions office and I say, great, Sal Khan is going to be admitted. I call down to our financial aid office. This is all done electronically now. But, you know, the financial aid officer, what he will do is open up your electronic file, and he will see the fastest sitting in there. And then he will see that and it will say, okay, you know, the Khan family should be able to pay, you know, $1,000 towards Sal's education. We cost $50,000. So now we're going to have to create a financial aid package for $49,000 to make it possible for you to come here. And so that's before you've been officially admitted? Typically, it's typically when you get admitted. Then the admissions office will say, okay, now calculate a financial aid package. And are these, you know, I can imagine a lot of students would worry about this. Are these kind of separate processes, you know, or will the admissions officers be able to see the kind of estimated family contribution? And does that have the potential to kind of affect your chances of admissions? Oh, absolutely. I think colleges are mindful of the programs that they have in place to support these students. And so the college's overall mission plays a role in how they're distributing financial aid and the way they view students that they're going to support through what they uncover in the FAFSA. And Sal, let me add to that. There's two important, I think, definitions here. One is institutions that are need-blind and institutions that are need-sensitive. And that's an important question for students to ask as they're starting to research colleges. Typically, need-blind schools mean, you know, whether or not you're applying for aid has no impact on an admissions decision. And we will fund you to 100% of your demonstrated need based on the FAFSA. Okay? So that's an important one. If you're a student that's going to be a need-sensitive, and this is getting to your point, there are schools, and again, the great majority of schools are need-sensitive because they have limited budgets, so they might take into account at some point in the process financial aid. Again, if we're sort of talking to really high-achieving, low-income students right now, typically, they're still going to make out very well because even though the school might take into account need and the student may need as much as a full ride, if they're a really top, top student, that's still somebody they're going to support and probably pay for. If you're a student that's not as strong, that's when you might get caught in exactly what you're asking about is, oh, you need X number of dollars, you're sort of right in, you know, a range where we have a lot of choices. That may make you less attractive. So, again, the story I always tell students is the better student you are, not only the more opportunities you'll have for admission, but the better financial aid packages you'll be eligible for. That's right. And is it possible it might even go the other way where when they look at your need and they say, wow, you know, he or she comes from a family that, you know, didn't have all the resources of many of our other applicants, that that actually could be a positive when you apply? Oh, absolutely. I think the, for example, Andover operates on a need-blind admission initiative, and we're looking for students who meet the demands of our program. And when you see students who may not have had all the preparation in terms of leading up to come into Andover, it's very compelling to find students who could manage the rigor of our program and not have had that preparation. And so we would be very attracted to them and want to provide a financial aid package that supports them at our school. Colleges operate the same way. And Phil Sandler obviously, you know, well-recognized high school and colleges you're saying are operating in a very similar way, or many do. Exactly. Yes, they do. Right. Very cool.
