Let's say this past year I started a restaurant and I now want to think about what type of a profit I've been making at that restaurant. We're going to think about it in two different ways. We're going to think about it in terms of an accounting profit, which is really the type of profit that most of us associate with a business or a firm. And we're going to also think about it in terms of economic profit, which we'll see is a little bit different. And instead of telling us whether a business is producing income, it tells us whether it makes sense to even run the business in the way that we're actually running it. So first, let's focus on the traditional way of calculating profit. So let's say my firm, my restaurant, my firm is a restaurant. In year one, it brings in in revenue, it brings in $500,000. So revenue literally is the amount of money the customers pay me to eat at the restaurant. They are paying for their dinners. This is literally the money that's coming in the door. Sometimes people call it the top line because it's literally the top line of our income statement. I just wrote it. It's the top line. Now we have to think about our expenses. Now when you're running a restaurant, one of the obvious expenses is going to be the cost of food. So food, we're going to say cost us $100,000. Then you have the cost of labor. I have the wait staff, and I have the chefs, and the busboy, and all those people. In this past year, I spent $100,000. Then I have, and I'm going to assume that I don't own the building, that I rent the building. So building rent. So I'm assuming this is on the building. Let's say that that was $200,000. And then finally, I really just rented everything. I also rented the equipment, all of the stoves, the fridges, and all of that stuff. So none of this is stuff that I own, so the equipment rent. I spent another $50,000. So how much profit do I have here? Those are all my expenses. I didn't borrow any money, so I didn't have any interest expense or anything like that. How much profit do I have before paying tax, or essentially my pre-tax profit? The reason why we think of those terms is because the amount you pay in tax is usually derived from your pre-tax profit. And that depends on where this business is, what country, what state, what type of business it is. And the easy way to calculate pre-tax profit, and this is pre-tax, and we're thinking in terms of accounting profit right over here, is we take how much money comes through the door, and then we have to subtract out all of the payments we essentially have to make to other people. And what we have left is our pre-tax profit. And so $500,000 minus $450,000 gives us a pre-tax profit, I'll do that same bright yellow, of $50,000. And I'm assuming that I'm the only owner of this business, and so I can essentially take it all out for myself and maybe help pay my own personal rent or whatever else. Or I could take some of this or all of this and reinvest it back in the business. Maybe I start buying my equipment or I expand in some way. Who knows what I might do with that money? And this is just traditional accounting profit. This is how profit is calculated. Although this is a super simple example, in the future I'd like to do more nuanced examples in the accounting world. But this you would refer to as just accounting profit. When people in the everyday world talk about profit, this is normally what they're talking about. Now when economists talk about profit, they're talking about something slightly different. And the best way to realize that is to just calculate economic profit for this exact same business, or this firm, as an economist would call it. And a firm really is a general idea for an organization that is trying to maximize profit. So once again, it's year one. Actually, let me just copy and paste it. So it's year one. That's our revenue. So I'm going to copy and I'm going to paste it. So this right over here, so far so good. Looks pretty similar. But now we're going to think about things in a slightly different way. Economists view costs in terms of opportunity costs. And as we'll see some of the opportunity costs, you can measure in terms of dollars. But some are less explicit. So I'm going to write here, just so we can get in the economist frame of mind, opportunity costs. And within opportunity costs, there are going to be explicit opportunity costs and implicit opportunity costs. So first, let's do the explicit opportunity costs. Well, actually, all of these are explicit opportunity costs. So let me just copy and paste that. So I will copy and paste. So all of these are explicit opportunity costs. And the reason why they are explicit is I'm actually making up, I'm paying money for all of these things. Even the equipment and the rent of the apartment, I don't own it. I'm actually paying whoever does own it. These are direct outlays out of the business. I'm explicitly making these payments. And the reason why we can think of them as opportunity costs, even though they're given in dollar terms, is that if I'm spending $100,000 on food, that's $100,000 that I couldn't spend on something else. If I'm spending $100,000 on labor, that's $100,000 that I couldn't spend on something else. So I'm just measuring the opportunity costs in terms of dollars, but dollars that I could have spent on other things. But so far, it looks pretty much identical. I'm just viewing it with a slightly different lens. But you're like, well, what's the big deal here? Well, we're going to see a little bit of divergence when we start thinking about the implicit costs that really weren't taken into account here, the implicit opportunity costs especially. Implicit costs. So if I'm running this business, and let's say that in order to run it, I actually had to focus on it full time. I couldn't have actually quit my job. Then there's an implicit opportunity cost of the job that I gave up or my wages foregone. So let me write this down. Wages foregone. And this will depend on who we're talking about. But let's say I was a doctor. And I was making a nice, steady, risk-free $150,000 a year. So I was giving up $150,000 a year. Now we've listed all the explicit and the implicit opportunity costs. Now we're ready to calculate our economic profit. So let me draw a line over here. So our economic profit is going to be our revenue that we're taking in minus all of these expenses. So that gives us positive $50,000. But now we have to subtract the wages foregone. So then I get to negative $100,000. Now this is interesting. This is kind of a big discrepancy here. One, in accounting terms, I'm profitable. In economic terms, I'm not profitable. And the important thing to realize is economic profit, when it's negative, isn't saying, or you could say that we have a 100,000 economic loss or an economic profit of negative 100,000. This isn't saying that the business or the firm isn't spitting out money. What it is saying is it probably doesn't make sense to run this business, or at least run this business in this way. If this was zero, that means, hey, it's probably making money, but you're kind of neutral whether it makes sense to run it this way or not. If it's positive, that means it definitely does make sense to run the firm in this way, and that it is definitely doing better than all of the alternatives. So this right over here is saying, look, you're making $50,000 a year. That's the $50,000 that you have to spend if you're the owner or reinvest in the firm. This is saying, essentially, look, you could have been making more money than that $150,000. Instead of making $50,000 doing this, you could have been making $100,000 more doing something else. So you are essentially giving up $100,000 to do this restaurant. So if you're a rational decision maker and you really are about maximizing your profit, this actually might not make so much sense for you.
