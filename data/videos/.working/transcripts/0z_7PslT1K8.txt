Welcome to Khan Academy, a revolutionary platform transforming the way we learn. Founded in 2008 by Sal Khan, Khan Academy is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. I'm Rachel Anderson, a professional learning specialist with Khan Academy. In this course, my teammates and I are excited to guide you through how to use and navigate Khan Academy and introduce you to Khanmiko, our AI-powered learning assistant, which can further support your students' educational journey. You'll discover practical ways to use Khan Academy at home, whether you're helping with homework, teaching homeschool, or encouraging independent study. By the end of this course, you'll have the tools and confidence to make the most of Khan Academy and Khanmiko, empowering your students to achieve their learning goals. Khan Academy offers a vast library of instructional videos, practice exercises, and a personalized learning dashboard. This allows students to learn at their own pace, mastering concepts before moving on to more advanced topics. The Khan Academy platform serves a diverse audience, from elementary school students to adult learners. Our courses cover a wide range of subjects including math, science, economics, arts and humanities, and even life skills. One of the key focuses of Khan Academy is mastery learning. This approach ensures that students fully understand a topic before progressing. With features like instant feedback and tailored practice, learners can revisit challenging concepts as many times as needed. Recently, Khan Academy has embraced AI-enabled education with the development of Khanmiko, our AI-powered teacher assistant and personal tutor. By integrating artificial intelligence, the platform can provide personalized learning experiences that adapt to each student's unique needs. This means more effective learning pathways and support toward individual progress. Schools across the country have been partnering with us to connect students with Khanmiko. As a caregiver, you have the opportunity to purchase a Khanmiko subscription for use in a home school setting or if your child's traditional school does not already provide access through a Khan Academy partnership. As a non-profit organization, Khan Academy relies on donations and partnerships to keep its resources available for everyone. This commitment to accessibility ensures that quality education is available to all. In summary, Khan Academy is more than just an educational platform. It's a movement towards equitable education through innovative technology and mastery learning. Join us in making education accessible for everyone, everywhere.
