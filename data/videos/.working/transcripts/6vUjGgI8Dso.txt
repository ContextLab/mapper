which of the differential equations are separable? And I encourage you to pause this video and see which of these are actually separable. Now, the way that I approach this is I try to solve for the derivative, and if when I solve for the derivative, if I get dy dx is equal to some function of y times some other function of x, then I say, okay, this is separable, because I could rewrite this as, I could divide both sides by g of y, and I get one over g of y, which is itself a function of y, times dy is equal to h of x dx. You would go from this first equation to this second equation just by dividing both sides by g of y and multiplying both sides by dx, and then it's clear you have a separable equation, you can integrate both sides. But the key is let's solve for the derivative and see if we can put this in a form where we have the product of a function of y times a function of x. So let's do it with this first one here. So let's see, if I subtract y from both sides, I'm just trying to solve for the derivative of y with respect to x, I'm gonna get x, x times, I'll write y prime as the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to three minus y. So I subtracted y from both sides. Let's see, if I divide both sides by x, I'm gonna get the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to, actually I'm gonna write it this way, I'm gonna write it three minus y times one over x. And so it's clear, I'm able to write the derivative as a product of a function of y and a function of x. So this indeed is separable. And I could show you, I can multiply both sides by dx, and I can divide both sides by three minus y now, and I would get one over three minus y dy is equal to one over x dx. So clearly, this one right over here is separable. Now let's do the second one. And I'm gonna just do the same technique. I'll do it in a slightly different color so we don't get all of our math all jumbled together. So in this second one, let's see, if I subtract the two x, the two y from both sides, so actually let me just do, whoops, let me do a couple things at once. I'm gonna subtract two x from both sides. I am going to subtract two y from both sides. So I'm gonna subtract two y from both sides. I'm gonna add one to both sides. So I'm gonna add one to both sides. And then what am I going to get if I do that? This is gonna be zero, this is gonna be zero, this is gonna be zero. I'm gonna have two times the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to negative two x minus two y plus one. And now let's see, I can divide everything by two. I would get the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to, and actually, yeah, I would get, I'm just gonna divide by two. So I'm gonna get negative x minus y, and then I'm going to get plus one half. So it's not obvious to me how I can write this as a product of a function of x and a function of y. So this one does not feel, this one right over here is not separable. I don't know how to write this as a function of x times a function of y. So this one, I'm gonna say is not separable. Now this one, they've already written it for us as a function of x times a function of y. So this one is clearly separable right over here. And if you want me to do the separating, I can rewrite this as, well, this is dy dx. If I multiply both sides by dx and divide both sides by this right over here, I would get one over y squared plus y. Dy is equal to x squared plus x dx. So clearly separable. All right, now this last choice, this is interesting, they've essentially distributed the derivative right over here. So let's see, if we were to unfactor the derivative, I'm just gonna solve for dy dx. So I'm gonna factor it out. I'm gonna get dy dx times x plus y, x plus y is equal to x. Now if I were to divide both sides by x plus y, I'm gonna get dy dx is equal to x over x plus y. And here, my algebraic toolkit of how do I separate x and y, so I can write this as a function of x times a function of y. Not obvious to me here. So this one is not separable. So only the first one and the third one.
