      "question": "A government allows a foreign company to build a hydroelectric dam upstream of a river valley. The dam supplies $80\\%$ of city electricity and raises company profits. Downstream, 1,200 farmers lose land, fish stocks fall, and floods worsen. The farmers form a protest group, use media campaigns, and win a court case that forces the government to revise water-sharing rules and pay stronger environmental compensation. Which explanation best shows the three political ecology ideas: uneven distribution of environmental costs and benefits, environmental change altering the political/economic status quo, and the politicization of environmental issues?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The scenario shows uneven costs and benefits (farmers lose, city gains), environmental harm triggered political and legal change, and farmers politicized the issue through protest and courts.",
        "B": "The main problem is poor engineering; technical fixes by the company can restore fish stocks without changing political power or who benefits.",
        "C": "Because the company hires some local workers, the benefits are shared equally and no political or social conflict explains the environmental changes.",

      "question": "In the country of Novara, a written constitution guarantees free assembly. Parliament passes Statute S limiting protests within 200 metres of government buildings. The President issues Regulation R telling police not to enforce Statute S unless public safety is threatened. A private firm, BrightTech, sues a union for economic losses after a protest outside its factory. The union argues Statute S violates the constitution. Novara’s constitutional court then rules Statute S unconstitutional and void. Which option best describes the legal interaction, the public vs private law issues, and the likely social or economic effect of the court’s ruling?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The constitution is supreme and can invalidate statutes. Statute S was public law, while BrightTech’s suit is a private-law economic claim that depends on public-law limits. The court’s ruling strengthens protest rights, increases civil-society influence, and may raise costs for firms facing more protests.",
        "B": "The President’s Regulation R overrides both the constitution and Statute S, so the case is purely private law. The court ruling simply enforces contract rules and has no effect on politics or the economy.",

Which approach is most likely to produce the best just-in-time evacuation plan, and why?",

Company A proposes a steady harvest of 120 tons per year and will not change habitat. Company B proposes a harvest of 200 tons per year but will pay for habitat restoration that takes effect at the start of year 2 and raises reproduction to 20% per year. Which option most likely maintains the fish stock sustainably in the long term and matches what proper natural-capital accounting would favour?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Approve Company A: 120 t/yr is sustainable because it is less than the 10% annual addition ($0.10\\times1000=100$ t/yr).",

Private clinics offer extra procedures, and patients rarely see the full price. A new vaccine costs $200 per person and directly increases an individual's quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.01.
