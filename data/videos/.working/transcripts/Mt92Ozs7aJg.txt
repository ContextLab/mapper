we are asked to find the value of this indefinite integral. And some of you in attempting this might try to say, all right, is the numerator here the derivative or constant multiple of the derivative of the denominator, in which case u substitution might apply, but it's not the case here, so what do we do? And my hint to you would be partial fraction decomposition, which might invoke some memories from a pre-calculus class or maybe from an algebra two class. But it's a technique to break up this rational expression into the sum of two rational expressions. And a good hint there is the fact that this denominator here is factorable into these two expressions. So what we're gonna try to do with partial fraction decomposition is say, can we express x minus five over two x minus three times x minus one? Can we express it as a sum of two rational expressions where the denominator of the first rational expression is two x minus three, and the denominator of the second rational expression is x minus one, and I don't have to put parentheses there, is x minus one. Now we don't know the numerators, as you might have learned before, and I encourage you if this is the first time you're ever seeing partial fraction decomposition, look that up on Khan Academy, we have many videos on it. But the general principle here is that your numerator is gonna be one degree less than your denominator. So our denominators here are first degrees, so our numerator is gonna be zero degree, or just constants. So it's gonna be some unknown constant there, let's call that a, and some unknown constant b. And our goal is to solve for a and b, and this is all a review, this isn't really calculus, this is more pre-calculus now, or algebra. How do we solve for a and b? Well, let's add them as if we're just adding two fractions with unlike denominators. So we wanna have a common denominator, so what we wanna do is multiply this first, this first rational expression by x minus one in the numerator and the denominator. So you could call this a times x minus one over two x minus three times x minus one. And then for this second rational expression, we'd multiply the numerator and the denominator by two x minus three. So two x minus three times b over two x minus three times x minus one. And now, since I have the same denominator, I can add them. And the goal is when I add them, when I think about the numerator, I will try to say, well, how do the a's and b's line up to what we have already right over here? So this is going to be equal to same denominator, so the denominator is two x minus three times x minus one. And then the numerator, actually, let me do it over here. This is the same thing as ax minus a, just distributing the a. And if I distribute the b here, this is the same thing as two bx minus three b. And so if we add the numerators, we can add the x terms, ax plus two bx. So we could call that a plus two b times x. And then if we add these constant terms, minus a minus three b. And since we have a minus right over here, I'm gonna try to pattern match. So I'm gonna have minus, and I'll write that as minus a plus three b. If you distribute this negative sign, then you're gonna get negative a and negative three b. So these are equivalent. And now we can see the pattern. We can say, all right, our denominators are not the same, so this thing in our numerator has to be the same thing as x minus five. So whatever our coefficient here is on x, that's gotta be equal to one. That's the coefficient on x. And this thing that we're subtracting, that's gotta be equal to five. And we're gonna set up a system of two equations with two unknowns to solve for a and b. So we know that a plus, so let me write that down. We know that a plus two b needs to be equal to one. And we know that a plus three b, or a plus three b, is going to be equal to five. And so now to solve for a and b, well we could do that by elimination. So let's see, what if we multiply this top equation by negative one? So that'd be negative a, negative two b, negative one. And now we add them together. The whole point was to cancel out the a's, so we're left with negative two b plus three b. That's just going to be b is equal to four. And then we can substitute back in to solve for a. So let's say right over here, we know that, we know that a plus three times four, so that's gonna be 12, I'm using this equation right over here, is going to be equal to five. Subtract 12 from both sides, you get a is equal to negative seven. So just like that, we can rewrite this entire integral. We can say this is going to be equal to the indefinite integral of, open parentheses, a over two x minus three, we now know that a is negative seven. So it's negative seven over two x minus three. And then we're going to have plus b, b is four, so plus four over x minus one, over x minus one. And close the parentheses, dx. Now, if you are so inspired, I encourage you to pause the video and try to run with it from this point, because we have seen the techniques to solve integrals like this before, but I'll do it step by step. This is going to be the same thing as, actually let me just, so this is gonna be the same thing as the integral of, so two x minus three. I could write the negative seven here, but I'm gonna take the constant out of the integral. So I'll put a negative seven here. And to help us solve this, and this could be a one, but to help us solve this, it would be nice if we had a two here. Why is that? Because two is the derivative of two x minus three. And so then we can do our u substitution, which we have sometimes gotten practiced doing a little bit in our head. And so if we want this to be a two, we can't just multiply by two, we've also got to divide by two. And I could do that outside, because that's just a constant. D x plus, well the derivative of x minus one is one. So we just want a one up in the numerator. So we could take the four out of the integral, four times the integral of one over x minus one, d x. So this is going to be equal to, we just have our constant out front, negative seven halves. And since we have this thing in the denominator, and we have its derivative, we can really just think about this as integrating with respect to this thing in the denominator. You can sometimes view u substitution, which I'm not explicitly going to do here, as the reverse chain rule. The antiderivative of one over x is the natural log of the absolute value of x. But here, the antiderivative of this is going to be the natural log of the absolute value of two x minus three. And then for this part, this is going to be plus four, times the antiderivative here is the natural log of the absolute value of x minus one. And once again, I can do that, because the derivative of x minus one is just one. And of course, since we're taking an indefinite integral, we do not want to forget our plus c. And we're done.
