We're asked, how many centiliters are in one deca liter? So the first thing we want to do is just think about how much is a centiliter relative to a liter and how much is a deca liter relative to a liter? And I'll write the prefixes down. And really, you should have these really memorized, because you're going to see these prefixes over and over again for different types of units. So the prefix kilo, sometimes kilo, this means a thousand. That means a thousand. If you see hecto, hecto means 100. Deca means 10. If you have nothing, then that just means one. So let's put that there. Then if you have deci, this means 1 tenth. If you have centi, this means 1 hundredth. If you have milli, this means 1 thousandth. So let's go back to what we have. We have centiliters. We have centi right over here. So a centiliter, let me write this in a different color. If you have a centiliter, this is equal to 1 hundredth of a liter. Or you could say 1 liter for every 100 centiliters. So you could also write it like this. 1 liter for every 100 or per every 100 centiliters. So we got the centiliter, and let's think about the deca liter. So the deca is right over here. So a deca liter means 10 liters. Or another way to say it is for every 10 liters, you will have 1 deca liter. Now before I actually work out the problem, what's going on here? We're going from a smaller unit to a larger unit. So there are going to be many of the smaller units in one of the larger ones. And we could do it multiple ways. So we want to essentially convert 1 deca liter into centiliters. Now we could just do it by looking at this chart, or we could do it with the, I guess you'd call it, dimensional analysis, making sure the dimensions work out. Let's do it the first way. So if you have 1 deca liter, how many liters is that? Well that's going to be 10, let me write it over here. So 1 deca liter over here would be the same thing as 10 liters. That's liters. We're assuming that our unit is liters here. And then 10 liters is going to be how many deca liters? It's going to be 100 deca liters. Because each of these is 10 deca liters. And you have 10 of them. So every time you go down, you're going to be multiplying by a factor of 10. 100 deca liters is how many centiliters? Well 100 deca liters, each of them is going to be worth 10 centiliters. So that's going to be 1,000. So we have our answer. 1 deca liter is 1,000 centiliters. Now the other way to do it is you could convert a deca liter to liters, and then convert a liter to centiliters. So if we have 1 deca liter, and whenever you do unit things, just make sure that it makes sense. Sometimes people, instead of multiplying, they would divide and they'd get, oh, 1 deca liter is equal to 1,000th of a centiliter. And they say, no, no, no, no. A deca liter is a much larger unit than a centiliter. So 1 deca liter has to be a bunch of centiliters. So this should be a large number. So you should always do that reality check whenever you're dealing with units. Now let's do it the dimensional analysis way. We're starting with 1 deca liter. We want to convert it to liters. So if you're converting it to liters, you want the deca liter in the denominator. Deca liter. And you want liters in the numerator. Now, how many liters are 1 deca liter? Well, or you could say, well, 10 liters is equal to 1 deca liter. 10 liters is equal to 1 deca liter. So 1 deca liter is equal to, these cancel out, 1 times 10 is 10 liters. Now if we wanted to convert this to centiliters, we're going to want the liters in the denominator. And you want the centiliters in the numerator. Now how many centiliters are there per liter? How many centiliters? Well, 1 liter is 100 centiliters. Centiliter is 1 hundredth of a liter. Notice this and this are the inverse statements. They're saying the exact same thing, 1 liter per 100 centiliters. Here, writing 1 liter per 100 centiliters, we've just flipped it. But it's giving the same information. And the reason why we flipped it is so that the liters cancel out. And then we're just left with 10 times 100 is 1,000 centiliters. 1,000 centiliters. And we are done.
