We're told David uses a catapult to launch a water balloon from a height of one meter with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second at an angle of 35 degrees from the ground. He's trying to launch the water balloon over a target that is 55 meters away and is 2 meters tall. Write two parametric equations that model the path of the water balloon and what is the height of the water balloon when it reaches the target? So pause this video have a go at that and then we'll do it together. Alright, so let's work through this together. And this is going to involve a little bit of physics. If you want to go deeper on the physics or prove some of the formulas, I encourage you to look at physics on Khan Academy. But we have an initial velocity of 25 meters per second at an angle of 35 degrees. Some of you might be already familiar with the concept of a vector, but that's one way of representing something that has a magnitude and a direction. So in this case our magnitude is 25. We're going to assume everything is in meters per second when we're talking about velocity and its direction, it's at an angle of 35 degrees with the horizontal. Now what we want to do to set up our parametric equations is break down this velocity in terms of its horizontal or its x component and its vertical component. And then we can set up its x position as a function of time and its y position as a function of time. Those will be our two parametric equations. So let's think about the velocity in the x direction. You could think of breaking up that vector, that arrow right over there into two components. That would be the x component and then maybe in we pick another color here that I haven't used yet. Maybe in purple I will have the y- Oh, that's not purple. I'll go with it anyway. That is the y component. Now we know from trigonometry this is a right triangle and we can just use actually not even the unit circle. We could even go all the way back to our SOHCAHTOA definitions of sine, cosine, etc. This 25 meters per second, this 25 is the length, the magnitude of that hypotenuse. So what we have right over here the horizontal component, that will be the hypotenuse times the cosine of this angle, cosine of 35 degrees. We know that cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse and then from that you can get this right over here. And then similarly the vertical component is going to be 25 times the sine of 35 degrees. Now just from this we're very close to setting up what our x position is as a function of time. We can say that x as a function of time is just going to be our velocity in the x direction. So 25 times cosine of 35 degrees, whatever this number is, we could evaluate it with a calculator, times time. We're assuming we don't have any acceleration where we're assuming there's no friction or air resistance. Maybe we're doing this on a planet someplace or on a moon that has no atmosphere. But this is oftentimes an assumption we make when we're doing these introductory types physics problems. So this is our first parametric equation. Now let's think about it in the y direction. Now this is going to get a little bit more involved. I want to get that same color. Yeah, there you go. Is that the same color? No, not quite. Let me, as you can tell, sometimes I'm impaired by these colors a little bit. All right, so y of t, yeah, that's the same color, is going to be equal to, if we didn't have any gravity and any air resistance, we would just take the y component of velocity and multiply it by time. But we do, we know we have a gravity, and I'm not going to prove the equations here. We do this in other videos on Khan Academy. But your y as a function of time is going to be your initial velocity, 25 times sine of 35 degrees times time. But we're going to be taking away from that initial velocity until we get to some, until we get to zero. Our thing, our, if we just imagine what we're going to be doing, our trajectory for this, for this, what are we doing, a water balloon, it's going to go up and then it's going to go down. Or if you just imagine, it's going to take a parabolic trajectory like that. And if you just imagined its y velocity, it'll start really high, going upward, and then it's going to, so it's going to start high, then it's going to slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, and then it's going to, and then it's going to start increasing, but then as it goes down in the other direction. And so we have to incorporate gravity here. And the way that we incorporate gravity here in the equations is we take the, we take the acceleration of gravity, which is 9.8 meters per second squared, over 2 times t squared. Now, if we were just starting at, at y of zero is zero, then this would be it. But we know our, at y of zero, when t is zero, we're starting at a height of one meter. So we want to make sure that that's there too. With x of t, I don't have a term like that because we're just going to assume that x of zero is zero, and then we're going to see how long it took us to get, to move 55 meters or to make x equal to 55. But there you have it. I at least have my two parametric equations. Now, the next step is to figure out what is the height of the ball when it reaches the target. So what I need to do is figure out at what time is x of t or is x equal to 55. And then I could put that time back into this equation, the second parametric equation to figure out my height then. So let's do that. So I'll go back to yellow. So 55 meters, I'm assuming everything's in meters and meters per second, is equal to 25 times the cosine of 35 degrees times t. Now, if we want to solve for t, we would get t is equal to 55 over 25 cosine of 35 degrees. I guess we could simplify this a little bit. This is the same thing as 11 over 5. But let's figure out what that is, or at least what that is approximately going to be, get a calculator out. All right. So let's first make sure that we are in degree mode. If I click raid here, we go to the radiant mode. So let's go back into degree mode here. And so let's go to 35 degrees. I'm taking the cosine of it. Now let me multiply it by 5. I'm working on the denominator right over here. And then let me take the reciprocal of that or 1 over that and then multiply that times 11. Times 11. And so that's approximately, if I were to round, well, I'm going to round our eventual answer. I want to round to the nearest 10, but it doesn't hurt to have a little bit more precision in the in-between answer. So let's just call that 2.686. So that's approximately 2.686 seconds. Now, what we want to do now is take this value and evaluate y at that time. So what we want to do, we want to figure out y of, I'm running out of space here, y of, I'm going to write small of 2.686 is going to be equal to 25 sine of 35 degrees. All of that times 2.686. And then minus, this is the same thing as 4.9 times 2.686 squared and then plus 1. So let me just get my calculator out again. 35 sine, which is that, times 25. Times 25. This was initially, this is essentially our initial velocity in the y direction. If we wanted to write it out here, it'd be roughly 14.3 or 14.34 meters per second going straight up in the y direction. But we're going to multiply that. We want to see what our height is at 2.86 seconds. So times 2.686 is equal to that. So it's 38.5 for at least this first term. And then from that, I want to subtract and let me open that parentheses. And I could get 2.686 squared times 4.9 times 4.9. And if I were to close, I got the 4.9, that's just 9.8 divided by 2. If I close the parentheses, I get that. And so this is going to be equal to 3.16. And then I have to add that one at the end. So plus 1 is 4.164. If I'm rounding to the nearest 10th, it's approximately 4.2 meters. So all of this business is approximately 4.2 meters. So it's clear that we are actually clearing our target.
