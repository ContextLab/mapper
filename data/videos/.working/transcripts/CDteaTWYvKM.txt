So my name is Scott Seeken and I have a PhD in developmental neurobiology and I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the depth of content that it's on Khan Academy. Throughout grad school I was told over and over again about saltatory conduction in motor nerve nerves and none of the instructors I had was ever able to tell me exactly how and why that made the nerve impulse faster and I learned that from Khan Academy teaching me that very clearly and very concisely exactly how that functions not just that it functions. Thank you very much.
