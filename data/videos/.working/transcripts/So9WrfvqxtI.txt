- [David] Good day, good wordsmiths. We have a fearsome foursome
of words for you today in the Vocabulary Corner. You know the drill, definitions, and then if conditions permit, we'll use each word in a sentence. The words for this video
are critical, approximately, moreover, and conversely. Critical is an adjective that
can mean two different things: very important, and also
pointing out faults or flaws. So water, right, is
critical for human survival. I need to drink water to live.
That's one kind of critical. But my friend, Gingabeeb the Judgmental... - [Gingabeeb] Your
glasses are smudged today. - [David] Can be the
other kind of critical and point out all my
failings as she sees them. Hi, Gingabeeb. - [Gingabeeb] Hi. I don't
like that shirt on you. - [David] I'm just gonna keep going. - [Gingabeeb] Rude. - [David] Approximately is an adverb that means around or close to. So in approximately 10 minutes, Gingabeeb will get tired of doing this and go back to her little burrow. - [Gingabeeb] It's not
a burrow, it's a barrow. - [David] Moreover is an adverb that means also or in addition. And conversely, one last
adverb, means on the other hand. - [Gingabeeb] You left
out in an opposite way. - [David] Yes, fine, it also
means in an opposite way. Thank you, Gingabeeb the judgmental. - [Gingabeeb] You are not very good at disguising your irritation. - [David] Let's break
these words down, shall we? Crit in critical comes from a Greek root, meaning to judge or separate. And in this case, where
critical means important, it's about making a judgment call, what's critical and what's
not necessary or important. Approximate comes from add, meaning two and prox, meaning near. So it just means near to, basically. Cousin word that uses the
same root is approach, to come near. Moreover is fun 'cause
it's just two English words whacked together. More and over both have old English roots, as opposed to the Greek or Latin roots that a lot of vocabulary words have. It's only been written as
moreover as one word like this for about 600-ish years. Finally, for conversely, we've got con, which means with or together,
verse meaning to turn, so the converse of something
is all turned around, the opposite, and then
there's our old friend -ly, the adverb forming suffix. So to do something conversely
is to do it in a way that is all turned around or opposite. Time for using these
words in some sentences. "It's critical to remember that you can have too
much of a good thing. A little bit of banana and
pickle frosting is delicious, but too much can make you very sick." - [Gingabeeb] Banana and
pickle frosting sounds gross. - [David] Oh, ye of
little faith. Next one. "Colorblindness is a
relatively rare condition. Approximately one in every 12 men and one in every 200 women
struggle to tell the difference between certain colors,
like red and green." It's not exactly one in 12
men and one in 200 women, it's around that number. "Moreover, it has made my job
at the traffic light factory a living nightmare." Last one, "On the one hand, it
would be cool to time travel to the age of the dinosaurs. Conversely, on the other
hand," in an opposite way, "I would rather not be
eaten by velociraptors." No snappy retort, Gingabeeb? - [Gingabeeb] No, those were
pretty good sentences actually. I learned a lot. - [David] Thank goodness. All right, I'll see you in
the next one, wordsmiths. Until then, you can learn
anything. David out. - [Gingabeeb] And I'll see
you in the next one, David. - [David] Gingabeeb, is that a threat? - [Gingabeeb] It's a promise.
