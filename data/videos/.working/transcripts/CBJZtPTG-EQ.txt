Now, let's review the top 5 things you need to know about how to complete assignments on Khan Academy. First, let's discuss the types of assignments. There are two main types of assignments on Khan Academy. The first is Practice, indicated by the mastery icon. Practice can include exercises, quizzes, or unit tests. While completing assignments, you will receive instant feedback after each question you answer. The second type is Instruction, noted by the play symbol and the paper symbol. Instructional content can come in the form of videos or articles, helping you learn new skills or review concepts that were covered in class. All videos have subtitles for easy following. If you're stuck, take a hint. Feeling stuck when learning is natural, but don't get discouraged. Khan Academy offers hints for specific questions, providing step-by-step guidance. Be sure to jot down those hints for future reference. Additionally, you can watch related videos or read articles to gain deeper understanding. You will find help-related links under the skill you are working on. If needed, don't hesitate to seek support from classmates, teachers, or family members. Be patient and persistent. Don't worry if you're not satisfied with your initial score on a practice exercise. You can always retry assignments until you achieve a score you're proud of. Just click Try Again to start over. You can even go back to assignments with past due dates to improve your score. Remember, every challenge and mistake is a part of your learning journey and contributes to your intellectual growth.
