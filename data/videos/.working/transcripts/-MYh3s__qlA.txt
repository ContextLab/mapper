In the sequence above, the first term is 1, and each term after the first is twice the preceding term. What is the sum of the 16th, 17th, and 18th terms in the sequence? So let's write the sequence down again. So it's 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and just keeps going on and on and on. So the first term here, this is the first term, what is this? Well, one way to think about it is that this is 2 to the 0 power, and then our second term right over here, this is 2 to the first power, and then our third term right over here, this is 2 to the second power. Our fourth term here, you see the pattern, this is 2 to the third power. Our fifth term in the sequence, this is 2 to the fourth power. So if we were to go to the 16th, 17th, and 18th terms, so let's go there. So if we were to go to the dot, dot, dot, if we were to go to the 16th, 17th, and 18th term, the 16th term is going to be, if we just follow this pattern right over here, it's going to be 2 to the 1 minus less than the term power. When it's the fifth term, it's the fourth power. When it's the fourth term, it's the third power. So it's going to be 2 to the 15th power. This is going to be 2 to the 16th power, and this is going to be 2 to the 17th power. And so what's the sum of the 16th, 17th, and 18th terms in the sequence? Well, it's going to be 2 to the 15th plus 2 to the 16th plus 2 to the 17th. Now, this is accurate, but if you were taking this on a test and this wasn't the form that they have it in, we could try to manipulate this a little bit. And the one way to manipulate it would be, well, let's try to factor out a 2 to the 15th power. So if you factor out a 2 to the 15th power, so this is going to be 2 to the 15th times, so 2 to the 15th divided by 2 to the 15th, that's just going to be 1. 2 to the 16th divided by 2 to the 15th, well, just that's going to be 2. Let me write that down. 2 to the 16th over 2 to the 15th, that's equivalent to 2 to the 16 minus 15th power, which is just equal to 2 to the first, which is just equal to 2. So that's going to be 1 plus 2. And then finally, 2 to the 17th divided by 2 to the 15th is equal to 2 to the second power, or just 4. So just 4 right over there. And this, obviously, will simplify to 1 plus 2 plus 4 is just 7. So the answer to their question, it would be 7 times 2 to the 15th. So it would be 7 times 2 to the 15th power.
