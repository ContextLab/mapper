Emeka and Tom spun the big wheel to Enterprise. I guess this is the big wheel that they spun. Emeka got 17. Tom got a number that was 15 more than Emeka's number. What number did Tom spin? And try to pause the video and figure it out on your own. So what I like to do is I like to write down what they tell us and then think about what might make sense. So first of all we have Emeka. They tell us that Emeka, Emeka got a 17 when she spinned the wheel. So Emeka got a 17. This is Emeka's number right over here. She got a 17. Now what about Tom? So Tom, Tom, they tell us Tom got a number that was 15 more, more than Emeka's number. So did Tom get a higher number or a lower number than Emeka? Well Tom's number is 15 more than Emeka's. So it's going to be a larger number. So it's going to be Emeka's number plus 15. So 15 more than 17. So it's Emeka's number. It's going to be 15 more than that. So notice 15, let me do this in blue. 15 more than Emeka's number. Well Emeka's number is 17. 15 more than that is going to be 17 plus 15. So what's 17 plus 15 going to be? So I can calculate it right over here. So I'll line them up. So 17 is one 10 and seven ones. And 15 is one 10 and five ones. And five ones. And I'm going to add. So let's first look at the ones place. So seven ones plus five ones. Well it's going to be 12 ones. So the 12 ones is the same thing as one 10 and two ones. So I could write the two ones down here. And then I would write the one 10 up here. Another way you could think about it is I just carried the one. Seven plus five is 12. I wrote the two down here. I carried the one. But what I'm really saying is look, seven plus five is 12. 12 is two ones and one 10. And now I just add up the 10s. One 10 plus one 10 plus one 10 is three 10s. So it's 32. So Tom got a 32. And you should always check to see if that makes sense. It says that Tom got a number that was 15 more than Emica's number. Well it's 32, 15 more than Emica's number? Is 32, 15 more than 17? Sure it is because 17 plus 15 is 32. That's how we figured it out.
