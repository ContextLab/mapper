        "A": "Unique factorization means every integer can be expressed as a product of primes in exactly one way (up to ordering). This is not trivially obvious — in some number systems (like ℤ[√-5]), unique factorization fails: 6 = 2·3 = (1+√-5)(1-√-5), two genuinely different factorizations into irreducibles. The uniqueness in ℤ depends on the Euclidean algorithm and the fact that primes in ℤ satisfy: if p|ab then p|a or p|b",
        "B": "Uniqueness of prime factorization is a trivially obvious property that requires no mathematical proof and was never the subject of serious investigation",

N is not divisible by any pᵢ (since dividing gives remainder 1), so N either is prime or has a prime factor not in our list — contradicting the assumption that we listed all primes",

This means whether p is a quadratic residue mod q is 'reciprocally' related to whether q is a residue mod p — with a sign determined by both primes being ≡ 3 (mod 4). This surprising reciprocity reduces the problem of determining quadratic residues to a simple computation involving only the two primes",
        "C": "Quadratic reciprocity states that every odd prime number is automatically a quadratic residue modulo every other odd prime number without exception, meaning the congruence x² ≡ p (mod q) always has an integer solution for any pair of distinct odd primes p and q regardless of their residue classes modulo four, and the Legendre symbol (p/q) always equals positive one for all such prime pairs",
        "D": "The law of quadratic reciprocity applies only to prime numbers that are less than one hundred and breaks down completely for all larger primes, because the arithmetic patterns that govern quadratic residues and the Legendre symbol become highly irregular and fundamentally unpredictable beyond this numerical range due to the increasing influence of prime gaps, irregularities in prime distribution among residue classes modulo four, and the growth of arithmetic functions"
