In this video, we're gonna do an example that gives us a little bit of practice to think about what does it mean to divide by a fraction? So if we wanna figure out what eight divided by 7 fifths is, but we're gonna break it down into two steps. First of all, we're gonna use these visuals here to think about how many groups of 7 fifths are in one, or another way of thinking about it is how many 7 fifths are in a whole. So pause this video and just think about this first part. All right, so let's look at 7 fifths. 7 fifths is everything from here all the way to there. And then one is this. So how many 7 fifths are in one? Well, you can see that one, which is the same thing as 5 fifths, is less than 7 fifths. So it's actually going to be a fraction of a 7 fifth that is one or that is in one. And you can see what that fraction is. One is what fraction of 7 fifths? Well, if you look at the fifths, 7 fifths is of course, seven of them, and a whole is 5 fifths. So five of the 7 fifths make a whole. So the answer right over here is 5 sevenths. 5 sevenths of a 7 fifths is equal to one. You can also see this right over here. If you take each of these to be a fifth, each of these to be a fifth, then this whole bar is equal to 7 fifths and the blue part is equal to one. So how many 7 fifths are in the blue part? Well, we can see it's 5 sevenths of the whole bar. Once again, 5 sevenths of the whole bar. So we can also think about this as one divided by 7 fifths, this is another way of saying how many 7 fifths are in one or how many groups of 7 fifths are on one. And this is equal to 5 sevenths, which we've learned in other videos is a reciprocal of 7 fifths. The numerator and the denominator is swapped. So now what is eight divided by 7 fifths going to be? Well, if one divided by 7 fifths is 5 sevenths, or if you have 5 sevenths of a 7 fifths in one, I know the world language gets a little bit confusing. Well, you're going to have eight times that many in eight. So this is going to be the same thing as eight times, we could do it this way, eight times one divided by 7 fifths. Or you could just view this as eight times the reciprocal of 7 fifths, which is 5 over 7. And we've learned how to multiply this before. Eight times 5 sevenths is going to be equal to 40 sevenths. And we're done. You could obviously also write that as a mixed number if you like, this would be the same thing as five and five sevenths. So the big picture is when we think about how many of a fraction are in one, that's the same thing as saying what's one divided by that fraction. As you see visually here, you essentially get the reciprocal of that fraction. And so if you take any other number other than one divided by that fraction, you're essentially just going to multiply it by that reciprocal because it's that number times one. So when you divide by that fraction, it's that number times the reciprocal.
