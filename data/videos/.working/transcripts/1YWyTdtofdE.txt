Let's see if we could figure out what two over three divided by five is equal to. Pause this video and see if you can figure this out. Well, there's a couple of ways that we can approach it. We can first do it in a conceptual way. Think about it visually. And to do that, let me represent 2 thirds. So let's say that this, that what I'm drawing right over here is a whole. This is a square, and it represents a whole. And now I could divide into three equal sections, and I'm gonna try to hand draw that. So this is, that looks pretty good. Three equal sections here. Each is a third, and we have two thirds. So we are really representing all of this stuff right over here. That is two of my thirds. Now I want to divide those two thirds by five. Well, the way I could do this is I could divide it into five equal sections. But if I'm doing it, I might as well just divide everything, all the thirds, into five equal sections. So let me do that. So one, two, three, and then four and five equal sections. So what is one of those five equal sections of my original two thirds? Well, this right over here is one of those five equal sections of my original two thirds. Notice I could draw that. I could draw another one here, another one here, another one there, and another one there. And I would have five equal sections that make up those two thirds. But what does just one of them represent? And if we figure out what this represents of the whole, then we know what two thirds divided by five is. Well, when I took my thirds, and I divided them into five equal sections, I essentially constructed 15ths. How do I know that? Well, I had one, two, three thirds, and then I divided it into one, two, three, four, five sections. So each of these squares right over here is a 15th. You have three times five, and you could count them if you like. And what we have circled off in red is two of these 15ths. We have one 15th right over here, and then two 15ths right over there. So this is going to be equal to two over 15. Now, another way that you could think about it, and over time, this is the way you will approach it, but it's nice to think about it conceptually, is when you divide by any number, it's the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. So five, five is the same thing as five wholes, or five over one. And so two thirds divided by five is the same thing as two thirds times the reciprocal of five, or the reciprocal of five over one, which is, you just swap the numerator and the denominator, which is one over five. And so another way of thinking about this is, this is one fifth of two thirds, which is once again, will be this section right over here. And the way you could compute this, conceptually, you see that this is two 15ths, but you could also say, well, I can just multiply, when I multiply fractions, I can just multiply the numerators, two times one is two, we do that same red color, two times one is two, and then I can multiply the denominators. Three times five is 15. And hopefully, what we just drew out helps make sense of why we can, why dividing by something is the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. And then when you multiply fractions, it's the same thing as multiplying the numerators to get our new numerator, and then multiplying the denominators to get our new denominator.
