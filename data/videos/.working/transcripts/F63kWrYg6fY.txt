What we wanna do in this video is figure out what 438 minus 272 is. And to help us think about that, we have these place value blocks right over here. And so you can see 438, we have 400s, 100, 200, 300, 400. We have three 10s, one, two, three. And then we have eight ones. You can count those eight ones right over there. And from that, we're gonna take away 200s. So that's 200 right over there. Seven 10s or 70 right over here and two ones. So pause this video and see if you can figure out what this is going to be. All right, now let's work through this together. So first of all, we could start in the ones place and we can see we have eight ones and then we're gonna take away two ones. So that's pretty straightforward. We're just going to be left with six ones right over here. Now let's go to the 10s place. Now the 10s place is interesting. We have three 10s here and we're trying to take away from that one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 10s. So how do you take seven 10s from three 10s? Well, luckily we can regroup from the hundreds place. What if we were to take this piece right over here from the hundreds to the 10s place? And now this is going to be the equivalent of 10 10s. So let me represent it that way. Once again, I took a hundreds. That's the same thing as one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 10s. Well, this is useful now because now I have 10 plus three 10s or you could say I have 13 10s and now I can take away seven 10s from that. So let's do that. Let's take away one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And what we are left with is six 10s right over here. So now I have six 10s left, six ones left. And then the hundreds, I have three hundreds. I'm gonna take away two of them. So I'm gonna take away 100 and 200. So I'm left with just 100 there. So I'm left with 100, six 10s and six ones. So this is 100, six 10s and six ones or 166.
