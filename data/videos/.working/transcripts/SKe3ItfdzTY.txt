The parallelogram shown below has an area of 24 units squared or square units. Find the missing height. So here's the parallelogram. This side has length six, this side has length five, and we want to find the missing height, and they gave us the area. So pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well, the key to solving this is to realize how the area relates to a base and a height. An area of a parallelogram, area of a parallelogram is going to be equal to the base times the height. Now what's the base in this scenario? Well, you could view this length right over here as the base, which is also going to be the same as that length, and a parallelogram opposite sides have the same length. The parallel sides have the same length. So this is going to be six, so our base is going to be six. And our height is what we want to figure out. So that, I will just write as, this is the h that we're trying to figure out. And we know the area. The area is 24 square units. So there we go. We have 24 is equal to six, is equal to six times the height. So six times what is equal to 24? Well, six times four is equal to 24. So we know that h is going to be equal to four units. H is equal to four units.
