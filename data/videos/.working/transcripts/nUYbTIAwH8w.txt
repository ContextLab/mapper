We're told here is a graph of a segment of f of x is equal to x, and so they've graphed that segment right over here. And then they tell us that g of x is equal to negative two times f of x, and they want us to graph g. So think about how you would approach that. Now let's work on this together. So g of x, whatever x is, I would evaluate f of x and then I would multiply that by negative two. So let's pick, say, when we are at x equals three. So f of three, it looks like that is three. In fact, we know that's three because f of x is equal to x. So f of three is three, but if we want to figure out g of three, that's going to be f of three times negative two, which is three times negative two, which is negative six. So f of three is negative six. Now let's think about negative five over here. When x is equal to negative five, we see that f of negative five is negative five, which makes sense. But if we were to take g of negative five, that's going to be negative two times f of negative five. So it's going to be negative two times negative five, which is positive 10. So it would get us up here. So really what you see happening when we multiply f of x by negative two, well, if we multiply it by two, we would just be scaling everything up by a factor of two, but then that negative then flips it over the x-axis to get what we see right over here. Let's do another example, but it's going to be a little different. Here, instead of multiplying times our f of x, we're multiplying the x by a number here. So here's a graph of the segment f of x is equal to x. We see that again. And now they've defined h of x as being equal to f of 1 3rd x. So let's graph h. So one way to think about it is, I know what f of two is, f of two is equal to two. Now for h, I could actually input six in here. I could figure out what h of six is. How do I know what that is? How do I know I can do that? Because h of six is going to be f of 1 3rd of six, or another way of saying it, h of six is going to be the same thing as f of two. So h of six is the same thing as f of two, which is two. And then we could do that on the negative side. For example, we know that f is defined at negative three. F of negative three is negative three. Now, if we were to go three times that value, and we would say, what is h of negative nine? H of negative nine, we could go over here. H of negative nine is equal to f of 1 3rd times negative nine. Or it's going to be the same thing as f of negative three. F of negative three is negative three. So h of negative nine is negative three. So notice, now we are scaling, we're making it wider when we multiplied inside of our function, or as we multiply x times a fraction. If we multiply this times a value greater than one, then we would be squeezing it in the horizontal direction.
