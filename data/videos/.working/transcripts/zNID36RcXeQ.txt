- [David] Hello, wordsmiths, and greetings from an old sewer tunnel. I'm doing a little bit of
underground exploration, which is really just a way of saying I'm sneaking around
where I ought not to be. But look what I found
down here. (groaning) Words. Wow, what a surprise. But what's inside, oh ho? Accumulate, vast, and consist. I'll define these words, I'll break 'em down into word parts, and then I'll use them in some sentences. Let's get going. Accumulate is a verb
that means to pile up, to increase in number. Vast is an adjective that
means very large or wide. And consist is a verb that almost always is followed by the preposition of, and it means to be made from, like my band consists of me, Spatz Monroe, and Checky Valastro. Those three people make up the band. The band consists of them. Now, let's break these words down. Accumulate is funny. It's made of ad, meaning to or of, and cumu, from Latin
cumulus, meaning a heap. It does that assimilation trick where the D in ad becomes another C to match up with the C in cumul, right? Instead of addcumulate, we say accumulate. Not a ton of other related words here. Maybe you've seen the term cumulus cloud, which is a big heaped
up, fluffy-looking cloud. Vast comes to us from Latin vastus, meaning empty or desolate. We use it just to mean very large, but it does have a
connotation of emptiness. It's funny, a city can be
vast, but so can a desert. Other related words include waste, which can mean a big empty space, and devastate, which means
to completely destroy or to lay waste to. Next, consist. Unlike the two previous words, consist is a rich vein of ore from which we can mine many related words. So con of course means with or together, and sist from the Latin
sistere, meaning to place or to be firmly in one spot. Something that holds together. From consist, we also
get the word consistent, which means that it stands
together across time, it stays the same. Other words using sist include insist, right, to take a stand,
to demand something. I insist that you stop poking me. Persist, to stay firm through opposition. Per means through. To keep at what you're doing. Let's use these words in some sentences, oh, thou persistent wordsmith. Thank you for sticking with me. The metropolitan subway network consists of six different rail lines, each a different color. Right, the network is made
up of six different lines. That's what the network consists of. They say that deep beneath the city, there's a vast network of
tunnels that goes on for miles. And right they are. It's so big down here. These tunnels are so wide,
you wouldn't believe it. After centuries of
collecting golden jewels, the dragon had accumulated a huge fortune in her mountain cave. She had accumulated, piled up, gathered in heaps great
quantities of gold and jewels. I think if I were a dragon, I would probably gather books. I would not sleep on top of them, though. That sounds very unpleasant to me, but maybe that's why I'm
a person and not a dragon. Yeah, wordsmith, I can't believe
this website's free either. Yeah, I'm just giving this wisdom away. Okay, now to find the exit
hatch for this tunnel network, because at some point I have to, you know, eat dinner and sleep in my own bed, so I will see you in the next one. Until next time, you can learn anything. David out.
