Let's figure out where 7 thirds would go on this number line right over here. And the first thing I want to make sure is that we know what the units of this number line are. So starting with zero we have one slash, another slash, a third slash, and then that's three. So the slashes must represent one. So this must be one, this must be two, and then this is three. And then going in the left direction, this must be negative one, this must be negative two, and then they already market for us. That is negative three. Each slash represents exactly one unit. So to think about where 7 thirds goes, I like to think of it as a mixed... So right now it's an improper fraction. I like to rewrite it as a mixed number. So 7 over 3, that's the same thing as 3 divided into 7. 3 goes into 7. 2 times 3 is 6. Your remainder is 1. So this is the same thing. So 7 over 3 is the same thing as 7 divided by 3. Which is the same thing as 2. 3 goes into 7 2 times, and then you have a remainder of 1. So it's 2 and 1, 2 and 1 thirds. This 1 is this 1 right over here. This third is this 3 right over there. And then this 2 is this 2 right over here. So 7 thirds is the same thing as 2 and 1 third. So where would I plot 2 and 1 third? So this is 1, this is 2, and then it's going to be 1 more third. So if I split this into thirds, 1, 2 and then 3, 2 and 1 thirds is going to sit right over there.
