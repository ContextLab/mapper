Ian can rake a lawn and bag the leaves in five hours. Chiaundre can rake the same lawn and bag the leaves in three hours. In three hours, working together, how long would it take them to rake the lawn and bag the leaves? So the best way to think about this is think about how many bags per hour each of them can do. And then we could add the number of bags per hour they could produce. And then use that to figure out how many hours per bag. So this first piece of information, Ian can rake a lawn and bag the leaves in five hours. So Ian is five hours per bag. Or you could view this, if we invert it, as 1 fifth of a bag per hour. Or one bag every five hours. This and this is saying the exact same thing. We can do the same thing for Chiaundre. In his or her case, I'm not sure whether Chiaundre is a boy or girl's name. He, well I'll say she, she'll take three hours per bag. So it's three hours per bag. Or that's another way of saying she can do. She can do, if you invert this, one third of a bag per hour. One third of a bag per hour. You can see it is three hours per one bag. You invert it, you get one bag per three hours. One bag for three hours. This is five hours per one bag. Same thing as one bag per five hours. You're just inverting the ratio, not really changing the information. Now, what's their combined rate? Well, Ian can do one fifth, one fifth of a bag per hour. And Chiaundre, Chiaundre can do one third of a bag per hour. So what is this going to be equal to? Well, we find a common denominator here. Least common multiple of five and three is 15. Let's put it over 15. So one fifth is the same thing as three fifteenths of a bag per hour. I want to keep the units here, bag per hour. And then one third is the same thing as five over 15 bags per hour. So when you add them, you get three plus five is eight. So this is equal to eight over 15 bags per hour. When I say bag, I mean all this stuff, rake, lawn, and bag. The whole tasks per hour, eight fifteenths of a task per hour. So working together, how long would it take them to rake the lawn and bag the leaves? Well, this is how many of the bagging they can do per hour. You can invert this. So if you invert that, you get this is equal to 15 over 8 hours per bag. 15 over 8 hours per bag, or if we want to write this as a mixed number, this is equal to one and seven eighths hours per bag. Let me write it like this. Hours, one and seven eighths hours per bag. And if we really want to get a sense of what seven eighths is in terms of hours, we can multiply it by minutes. So seven eighths hours times 60 minutes per hour. And let's see what we can do here. 60 and 8 are both divisible by 4. 8 divided by 4 is 2. 60 divided by 4 is 15. 7 times 15 is 70 plus 35 is 105. So this is equal to 105 over 2 minutes, which is equal to what? 52.5 minutes. So as a combined effort, it will take them one hour and 52.5 minutes to do it together. And we're done.
