We're told to complete the equations. They have 34 times eight, and then they have something times eight plus four times eight. Then they add all that stuff together and then they get something else. So pause this video and see, think about what should be in these blanks. All right, so let's just think about this first thing. And sometimes when you see all of these blanks and parentheses, it can get a little confusing. But if you just try to break down, how would you try to actually tackle this? Well, you could actually view 34 times eight as 30 times eight plus four times eight. And another way to think about it is, 34 is the same thing as 30 plus four, 30 plus four, and we're multiplying that times eight. So we're gonna multiply that whole thing times eight. And so then if you apply the distributive property, that's going to be 30 times eight. So 30 times eight plus four times eight, plus four times eight. So four times eight. And so what do we have right over here in this first step? Well, they have something times eight plus four times eight. So that something is going to be 30. And you can even verify that because in this next step, you can see that the four times eight is this 32 right over here. And you could say, well, what times eight is 240? Well, you can see that's definitely 30 times eight. Three times eight is 24. So 30 times eight is 240. So that is the same thing as that. So I know it's sometimes a little bit complicated, but just try to see what you would do if you were doing the distributive property, and then you'll see what numbers you might wanna fill in. Now this last step, we just have to add 240 plus 32. You might be able to do that in your head. 240 plus 30 is 270, plus another two is 272. If we want, we could write it out here, 240 plus 32. In the ones place, zero plus two is two. Tens place, four tens plus three tens is seven tens. And then we have 200 and 72.
