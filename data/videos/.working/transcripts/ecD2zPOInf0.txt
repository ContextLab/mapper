This right over here is the graph of the polar function. R is equal to five minus three sine of theta. What I want to do in this video is think about what is the slope of the tangent line. So what is the slope of the tangent line? When theta is equal to five pi over six, and just so that we can visualize that, when theta is five pi over six, so that's going to be an angle that looks something like, it's gonna look something like this. So this angle right over here is five pi over six radians. Five pi over six radians. This is R of five pi over six. And I want to figure out the slope of the tangent line. So the tangent line would look something like this. I want to figure out what is the slope of that. What is the slope of the tangent line? I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure it out on your own. So I'm assuming you've had a go at it. I'll give you a hint right over here. And maybe if you get inspired, I encourage you always to pause the video again and try it out on your own. But one, one, or a series of hints, is we know when we're kind of going between polar form and regular rectangular form, that X, X is going to be equal to R cosine of theta, and Y is equal to R sine of theta. And then I'll give you another hint, is that the slope of the tangent line, that's going to be DY DX at that point, which is going to be the derivative of Y with respect to theta divided by the derivative of X with respect to theta. And once again, in literal form, you don't really think of differentials as numerators or denominators of fractions, but they do tend to work out that way. And you notice that right over here. In both the numerator and denominator, you're dividing by theta, and then that essentially could be conceptualized. Or one way to think about it is that's the same thing as DY DX. You're taking the rate at which Y is changing with respect to theta, divide that by the rate at which X is changing with respect to theta, and that's going to give you the rate at which Y is changing with respect to X. So given these hints that I've drawn in pink, maybe another go at it. See if you can figure out the slope of the tangent line when theta is equal to five pi over six. So let's just think through it. Let's just think through it. I will start with Y over here. So Y, Y is R sine of theta, but we know that R is five minus three sine of theta. So it's going to be five minus three sine of theta times sine of theta. Times sine of theta. And so what's DY D theta? DY D theta, the derivative of Y with respect to theta. Let's see, we can take the derivative of this first expression, which is just going to be negative three cosine theta. Negative three cosine theta, that's the derivative of that, times the second expression. I'm just doing the product rule over here. Times sine of theta. And then we're going to have plus, plus the derivative of the second expression, which is just cosine of theta. Cosine of theta times the first expression. Times five minus three, three sine of theta. Now let's figure out what DX D theta is. So X, X is equal to, it's R cosine theta, R is five minus three sine theta. Five minus three sine theta times cosine theta, times cosine, whoops, I want to do that in that pink color, times cosine theta. And so DX D theta, DX, the derivative of X with respect to theta, the rate of change of X with respect to theta, once again, we just apply the product rule. It's going to be the derivative of this first expression, which is going to be negative three cosine theta times the second expression. This is once again just applying, I'm just applying the, I'm just applying the product rule here. And then plus the derivative of the second expression, so it's minus sine of theta times this first expression. So times five minus three sine of theta. And so now we can write, we can write, DY DX is going to be equal to DY D theta over DX D theta, DX D theta, which is equal to DY D theta, it's all of this business. Actually, let me just, let me just write it up, let me just copy and paste it. So copy and paste, so it's going to be that, and then let me copy and paste the rest of it. So plus that, so copy and paste, plus that, that's our numerator, and then our denominator is going to be all of this business. All of this. So copy and paste, so we'll put that in the denominator. So that's a general, and this is pretty neat already, this is a general expression for DY DX, which would be the slope of the tangent line. Notice it is a function of theta, expressed as a function of theta. So now we just need to figure out what is this going to be when theta is five pi over six? And we see a bunch of cosines and sines of five pi over six, and let's just remind ourselves what cosine or sine of five pi over six is. So I'll just write it over in this. So sine of five pi over six, five pi over six is pi over six away from the negative x-axis. So this is going to be sine of five pi over six is 1 1 by 2, and cosine of five pi over six is negative square root of three over two. And so we can use that information right over here. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, and gotta be careful here, let me just, so it's negative three times cosine of theta. So negative three times cosine five pi over six is going to be positive three, square roots of three over two, that's this part right over here, negative times a negative is a positive, times sine of theta, well that's 1 1 by 2, times 1 by 2, and then plus cosine of theta, which is negative square root of three over two, times five minus three sine theta. Three times sine of theta is 3 1 by 2, five minus 1 by 2 is 3.5, or another way of thinking, this is 7 1 by 2. So times 7 1 by 2, that's our numerator. Now our denominator, once again this is a little bit hairy, but we will power through. Well negative three cosine theta, we already figured out, that is three square roots of three over two, and then times cosine of theta, well that's going to be a negative, that's going to be another, so times negative square root of three over two. Let me do that same color so we can follow along actually. So times negative square root of three over two, minus sine of theta, so minus 1 1 by 2, and then all of this business, we already figured out was 7 1 by 2. So all of this is 7 1 by 2, and so this is going to be equal to, let's see if we can do this relatively neatly. So it's going to be three, this part right over here, is three square roots of three over four. This right over here is minus seven square roots of three over four. So what would that be? That would be negative four square roots of three over four. This is negative four square roots of three over four, or this just simplifies luckily to negative square root of three. Now in the denominator, what do we have? In the denominator, we have this term right over here is going to be, see, square root of three times square root of three is three, three times three is nine. So it's negative 9 1 by 2, negative 9 1 by 2. Do that right, yep, negative, oh sorry, negative 9 fourths, be careful. Negative 9 fourths, and then we have to worry about this right over there. So that's negative negative 7 fourths. So minus seven fourths. So do that right, yep, this is negative, and then this is negative as well. And so this is going to be equal to, the denominator here, is going to be equal to negative 16 fourths, negative 16 fourths, let me just write that, negative 16 fourths, which is going to be equal to negative four. So we have negative square root of three over negative four. So we deserve a bit of a drum roll over here, the negatives cancel out, we get square root of three, square root of three over four is the slope, is the slope right over here. And you can actually see it, it actually makes sense that that would be the slope of the tangent line there.
