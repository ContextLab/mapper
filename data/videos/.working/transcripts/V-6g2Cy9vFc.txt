What I wanna do in this video is try to figure out what three times 29 is. And there's a lot of ways of approaching this, but the way that we're going to think about it is using an area model. What do I mean by that? Well, we can imagine a rectangle that is three units long in the vertical direction or in that direction, and then 29 units in this direction, and this isn't drawn completely to scale. And if you were to multiply what three times 29 is, you would get this area right over here. So how can we use this area model? Well, one way to do it is to think about 29 as being the same thing as 20 plus nine. So for example, let's say that this part right over here is 20 units long in the blue. So I'm gonna split up this rectangle. So that part right over here is 20 units long, and this part right over here is nine units long. So this is nine, and to be clear, this part right over here is 20. And it's still 29 units long or wide because 20 plus nine is 29. Now, the reason why this is useful is I can now think about these different areas. I can now think about this area right over here. It's three units high and 20 units wide. So what's this area? Well, this area is going to be three times 20, which we can do in our head. Three times two is six, so three times 20 is 60 of these square units. And then we can also think about this area right over here. This area is going to be three times nine, which you might already know is 27. So if you wanna figure out the entire area here, which would be three times 29, you would just add the 60 plus the 27. So I could write it here, maybe. This is 60 plus 27, which is going to be equal to 60 plus 20 is 80, plus another seven is going to be 87.
