Hey parents, we know that trying to help your kids with their essays can often feel like navigating through an unknown city without a map, but don't worry, we're here to provide the compass that you need. We're proud to present our latest Conmigo feature, Academic Essay Feedback. This new feature provides immediate, high-quality feedback on essays, helping your child become a more confident writer. Let me show you how it works. To get started, all your child needs to do is submit a draft essay from any class, be it English, U.S. government, history, etc. Click Submit, then Conmigo gets to work. Right now, Conmigo works best for persuasive, argumentative, explanatory, or literary analysis essays up to about 1,500 words. You can see that Conmigo offers insights into everything from essay structure and organization to how well arguments are supported, even down to style and tone. Your child can view the feedback, ask for clarifications, make revisions, and then request more review. It's like having a personal writing coach at your fingertips. And unlike other AI tools such as ChatGPT, Conmigo doesn't do the writing for your child. It also goes beyond just correcting grammar or spelling. Instead, it's like a trusted mentor that guides students through the entire revision process. And you can get unlimited access to this feature and everything else Conmigo has to offer for just $4 a month or $44 a year.
