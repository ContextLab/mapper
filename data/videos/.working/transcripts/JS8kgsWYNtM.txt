- [David] Hello,
wordsmith. Ah, one second. (hissing) Hi, sorry, I was just doing
some deep sea diving for words. I brought you two treasures from the deep: submerge and profound. Let's define these words,
look at their origins, and then use each word in a sentence. Let me put my diving
suit away. One second. (diving suit clattering) First, submerge, a verb. To submerge is to go underwater or to put something underwater, like I submerged the French
fry in a lake of ketchup. Profound is an adjective,
and it means deep or intensely felt, showing deep
understanding or intellect, as in my explanation of the origins of the word profound will be profound. So let's take a deep dive,
hah, into these words' origins. Submerge, sub is a Latin
prefix meaning below, like subscribe, write your name under here so I can send you videos, or substandard, it's not very good, it's below the standard. Or submarine under the
marine, under the sea, where the underwater boat goes. And then merge means to plunge. The root there is merg. So to submerge is to plunge
below, splash beneath the water, although you could submerge in any kind of plungeable liquid, like fries into ketchup
in the earlier example. Now, turning to profound, we have pro, meaning towards, and found, or sometimes fund from Latin meaning bottom. So something profound is deep. It's going to the bottom of things. We can use it to mean literally deep, but its figurative meaning
is way more common. You can have a profound idea or read a profound book full of insights. Note that the noun form of
profound isn't profoundness; it's actually, it uses this
form, so it's profundity. You'll see the root found or
fund in other words in English, having to do with the base
or the bottom of something, like a foundation. It also has an association with money, like funds or funding. Fund was in Latin meant bottom, but it also meant piece of land, which was basically another
way of saying source of wealth. Alright, let's use these words
in some sentences, shall we? "When Lu submerged the dusty pot in water, decades of dirt washed away revealing the shiny metal underneath." She put the pot underwater.
She submerged it. The pot plunges beneath the water. "Andrea corrected her brother's
profound misunderstanding of the planet by explaining that no, the earth did not have
a gooey caramel center." His misunderstanding was
deep, nearly complete, a full, almost impressive misunderstanding of what the center of Earth is like. It was perhaps a little
stunning to Andrea. Mind you, the outer core of the earth is made of molten iron and nickel, but just because it's made
of 5,000-degree liquid metal doesn't mean I'm in a
hurry to call it gooey. You can learn more about that in Khan Academy's Earth Sciences course. But that's all the time
we've got for this one. I'll see you in the next. You can learn anything. David out.
