    "correct_answer": "It complicates treatment by requiring clinicians to address multiple interacting conditions, often reducing the efficacy of single-disorder protocols",
    "distractors": [
      "It simplifies treatment because co-occurring disorders always share a single underlying cause that can be targeted directly",
      "It eliminates the need for differential diagnosis because all symptoms are attributed to whichever disorder was diagnosed first",

    "distractors": [
