We are asked is a conic section with foci at F sub one and they give the coordinates in F sub two and these coordinates and points at P one and P two with these corresponding coordinates and ellipse a hyperbola or both. Why or why not? Pause this video, have a go at that before we do this together. All right, so let's just remind ourselves, if we're dealing with an ellipse, then we know that the distance from P one to F one plus the distance from P one to F two, so the sum of the distances of P one to the different foci, that should be equal to the sum of the distances for point two. So from P two to F one and from P two, P two to F two. Now, if we're dealing with an a hyperbola, so let me write that over here. So the hyperbola case, hyperbola, instead of the sum, we're looking at the difference and we're looking at the absolute value of the difference of the distances. So in the hyperbola situation, we're gonna have the distance from P one to F one minus the distance from P one to F two and we just care about the absolute value of it. We want this to be positive. That needs to be equal to the absolute value of the differences of the distances from P two to the foci, so plus D, P two and F two, and we're done. My hand is hurting all that notation. So what we have to do is just figure out these things and we don't have to figure out eight things, you don't have to figure out four of these and then we can look at them in each of these cases. So first, let's look at the distance from P one to F one. So that's going to be, I'll just do it right over here, it's going to be the square root of our difference in x values. So it's going to be zero minus one squared, it's just the distance formula. And then plus the difference in y values, so one minus zero squared, one minus zero squared. Well, this is just going to be one plus one square root, so this is just going to be the square root of two. So that's the square root of two, and by the way, this is also right over here, the square root of two. And now this one over here, distance from P one to F two, well, same idea, let's see, from P one to F two. So we have zero minus negative one, zero minus negative one squared, and then we have plus one minus zero squared, one minus zero squared. Well, this is just going to be one, this is going to be one squared, one squared plus one squared is just two. And so this is once again going to be square root of two. So the left-hand side over here has added up to two times the square root of two. And in this situation down here, this was the square root of two, so the left-hand side, the difference, the absolute value of the difference over here is just going to be zero. Now let's do the right-hand sides, and I'm going to find more colors. So the square root of P two, zero, one, so zero minus one squared plus one, sorry, plus negative one minus zero squared, negative one, negative one minus zero squared. Well, once again, this is one, this is one, you square them, you still get ones, you add them, you get a two, so this is going to be square root of two. This is also right over here, square root of two. And then last but not least, this piece right over here, I'm sensing a pattern, so we see, let's see, we're going from zero to negative one, so zero minus negative one squared plus negative one minus zero squared. So same idea, this all simplifies to square root of two. So this is also square root of two. So in this top scenario, this is two square roots of two. So the sum of the distances from each of the points to the two foci, they are actually the same. So these two points could be on an ellipse, but we also see the difference of the distances from each point to the foci. It stays constant. So they could also be on a hyperbola. So this is a case where the same set of two points could be on an ellipse or a hyperbola. And so you can imagine if you were to construct an ellipse that has those two points in a hyperbola that had those two points, those would be two points where those two conic sections would actually intersect.
