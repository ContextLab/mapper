In the last video, we worked out the step response of an RC circuit, and now we're gonna look at a real example. So this is our answer. This is the step response, the total response to our circuit to a step input. And what does this look like? So I'm gonna move down a little bit. We'll make up a circuit and we'll do a real example here. Let's say we do a step, and the step goes from 0.2 volts up to say 1.1 volts, and let's let R equal one k ohm. And let's let R equal one k ohm. K ohm. And let the capacitor equal four microfarads. So now let's plug these values over here into our solution and see what we get. Now first I'm gonna work out RC. RC is equal to one k ohm times four microfarads. And what does that equal? K is plus three, and micro is minus six. So one times four is four, and plus three minus six is times 10 to the minus three. And that is in seconds, so that's equal to four milliseconds. Now let's plug the rest of our values in here. V of t. The total response, or the step response, equals V naught, 0.2, minus VS, that's the step voltage, 1.1 times E to the minus t over four milliseconds, E to the minus t over four milliseconds, plus VS, plus VS, VS is 1.1. So I went ahead and I plotted this using a computer, and we'll see how close this comes to what we sketched earlier. So here's Vt, or the step response, the total response of our RC network to a step voltage. The step voltage is here in rows color, and it goes from 0.2 volts up to, oh I got it wrong, 1.2 volts, let's change that to the right number, 1.2, 1.2, and this is what it looks like. And if you go back and compare this to what we sketched at the beginning, it'll look pretty similar. So the output voltage, the voltage on the capacitor here, starts at V naught, which is 0.2, it ends up at VS, which is 1.2 in this case, and that's the forced response up here, and in between it did that smooth, exponential curve. That's what the step response of an RC circuit looks like.
