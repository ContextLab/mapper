What we're going to do in this video is refresh our understanding of place value, but we're going to dig a little bit deeper and think about place value in the context of decimals. So just as a refresher, if I had the number 973, this should be review for you. We already know that this rightmost space right over here, this is the one's place. And if we move one space to the left of that, this is the 10's place. Notice we went from ones to 10's. 10's are 10 times as much as ones. And then we move one space to the left of that, we go to the, we multiply by 10's again, we get to the 100's space. And so this 9 doesn't just represent 9, it represents 900. Or we could write that as 900. Similarly, the 7 doesn't just represent 7, it represents 7 10's, or 70. This 3 represents 31, so it actually does represent 3. But as I promised, we're now going to extend our understanding. And what we do is we put a decimal here, which you've probably seen before, at the right. And the reason why we even need a decimal is to really tell us where our ones place is. We say, okay, if we go right to the left of the decimal, that's going to be our one space. Because once we start introducing decimals, we can introduce as many spaces as we want to the right of the decimal. And so let's think about those a little bit. If when we went from 100's to 10's, notice, we divided by 10. When we go from 10's to 1's, notice you divide by 10. So what do you think this place over here is going to be called? Well, what happens if you take one divided by 10? Well then you get a 10th. So, as you might imagine, this is the 10th's place. And then if you were to go one place to the right of that, what would this place be? What would be 10th's divided by 10? Or one 10th of a 10th? So this would be a hundredth, hundredth's place. And then if you were to go one space to the right, and we could keep doing this forever, but if we were to go one space to the right of that, what would it be? Well, a hundredth divided by 10, or one 10th of a hundredth is a thousandth, thousandth space. And so, for example, if I were to extend this number, instead of it just being 973, if I were to write 973.526, what do these numbers, these digits represent? This five doesn't just represent five. It represents 5 10ths. Or another way of writing 5 10ths, you could write it like this, 0.5. You just have a five in the 10ths place. Or you could write it as 5 10ths. This two, and I think you get where this is going, this doesn't just represent two, it represents two hundredths. I'm just going to make it very explicit in this video, so it's very clear, two hundredths. Another way to write that is you just write a two in the hundredths place. So we're going one two spaces to the right of the decimal, or you could write it as two over a hundred, two hundredths. And so, you know, for kicks, pause the video, what are all the different ways of representing this six? What does this six represent? Well, this is 6 thousandths. 6 thousandths. This is thousandths. There you go. How would I could also write that as zero point, let's see, this is the 10ths place, hundredths place, and then in the thousandths place, I have six. Or I could write this as six over 1 thousand. Six thousandths. So big picture, place value, we can keep going to the right of the decimal, and we can start representing things that are, I guess you could say, more precise.
