The pH at the equivalence point of the titration is measured to be 2.54. Which of the following indicators would be the best choice for determining the endpoint of the titration? Justify your answer. Well, let's just remind ourselves, the endpoint of the titration is when the indicator changes color. And because that's our signal, our visual signal, so saying, hey, we must have hit the equivalence point, you want the pKa of your indicator to be as close as possible to the pH at the equivalence point. If the pH at the equivalence point is 2.54, well, which of these indicators have the closest pKa to that? Well, we see thymol blue has it at two right over here. So we would choose to use thymol blue, thymol blue because, because it's pKa, pKa closest to pH, pH at equivalence point. Equivalence, equivalence point. There you go.
