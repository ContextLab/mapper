Let f and g be the functions defined by f of x is equal to one plus x plus e to the x squared minus two x, and g of x equal x to the fourth minus 6.5 x squared plus six x plus two. Let r and s be the two regions enclosed by the graphs of f and g shown in the figure above. So here I have the graphs of the two functions and the enclosed regions r and s. So the first thing they want us to figure out is find the sum of the areas of region r and s. So the sum of those areas, you could think about it, we're gonna go from x equals zero right over here to x equals two, so we're gonna take the integral from x equals, let me write this down, area of r plus s is equal to, let me write that a little bit neater. So the area of r plus s is going to be equal to, let's see, we can take the integral from x equals zero to x equals two, x equals zero to x equals two, and what are we going to integrate? Well, we're going to integrate the difference between the two functions, and really the absolute value of the difference, where we want the sums, we don't wanna have negative area here, we want the sum of the areas of regions r and s, and at some point you have g of x is above f of x, and at other points f of x is above g of x, but if we take the absolute value, it doesn't matter which one we're subtracting from the other, we're just getting the absolute value of the difference. So let's take the absolute value of, the absolute value of f of x minus, minus g of x dx. So that's gonna be the sum of the areas, or we could say this is going to be the integral from zero to two of the absolute value, f of x is one plus x plus e to the x squared minus two x minus g of x. So minus x to the fourth plus 6.5 x squared minus six x minus two. Take the absolute value, dx. Now this would be pretty hairy to solve if we did not have access to a calculator, but lucky for us on this part of the AP exam, we can use a graphing calculator, so let's do that to evaluate this definite integral here. And if you're wondering why don't I say minus two instead of plus two, remember we're subtracting, we're subtracting g of x, we're finding the difference between them. So let's input this function into my calculator, and I'm gonna do the same thing that I did in part one, where I'm just gonna define, let me turn it on, all right. So I'm gonna actually clear that out, and I'm gonna define this whole expression as y one. So I am going to take the absolute value, so let me see where the absolute value, it's been a little while since I last used one of these. So, actually maybe it's a math, math number, oh there you go, absolute value. So it's the absolute value of one plus x plus second e to the, and then we have x squared minus two x, and then close that parentheses, and then you have minus x to the fourth power plus 6.5 times x squared minus six times x minus two, and then we have to close the parentheses around the absolute value, all right. So we've inputted y one, and so now let's go over here, and also evaluate this definite integral. So we go to math, and then we scroll down to definite for function integral, so click on that, and we're gonna use y ones, we go to variables, we go to the right to go to y variables, where it's a function variable that we just defined, and so we select y one, that's what we just inputted. Our variable of integration is x, and our bounds of integration, well we're gonna go from x equals zero to x equals two, so we go from zero to two, and then we let the calculator munch on it a little bit, and we get, it's taking some time to calculate, it's still munching on it, let's see, this is taking a good bit of time. There you go, all right, so it's approximately 2.00, if you wanna get a little more precise, 2.004, so this is approximately 2.004.
