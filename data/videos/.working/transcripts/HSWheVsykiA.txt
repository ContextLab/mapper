If 2m times k is equal to 6, then m times k is equal to 2. So let me just rewrite that down. They're telling us that 2m times k is equal to 6. And we need to figure out what m times k is. Well, we can really just put these parentheses around mk. Multiplication is associative. So this could be rewritten as 2 times mk is equal to 6. And now it becomes pretty obvious about how to solve for mk. Divide both sides by 2, you're going to have just an mk on the left-hand side. So let's do that. Divide both sides by 2, you're left with m times k is equal to 6 over 2, or 3.
