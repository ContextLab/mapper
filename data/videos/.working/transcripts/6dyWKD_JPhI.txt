The graph below contains the rectangle A, B, C, P. Draw the image of A, B, C, P under a dilation whose center is at P and a scale factor is 1 2 3rds. What are the lengths of the side A, B and its image? So we're going to do a dilation centered at P. So for centering a dilation at P, that means that every other point is going, and its scale factor is 1 2 3rds. That means once we scale, once we perform the dilation, every point is going to be 1 2 3rds times as far away from P. Well P is 0 away from P, so P is still going to be, its image is still going to be at P. So let's put that point right over there. Now point C is going to be 1 2 3rds times as far as it is right now. So let's see, right now it is 6 away. It's at negative 3 and P is, or its x coordinate is the same, but in the y direction, P is at 3, C is at negative 3, so it's 6 less. We want to be 1 2 3rds times as far away. So what's 1 2 3rds of 6? Well 2 3rds of 6 is 4, so it's going to be 6 plus 4, it's going to be, you're going to be 10 away. So 3 minus 10, that gets us to negative 7, so that gets us right over there. Now point A, right now it is 3 more in the horizontal direction than point P's x coordinate. So we want to go 1 2 3rds as far. So what is 1 2 3rds times 3? Well that's going to be 3 plus 2 3rds of 3, which is another 2. So that's going to be 5. So we're going to get right over there, then we can complete the rectangle. And notice, point B is now 1 2 3rds times as far in the horizontal direction. It was 3 away in the horizontal direction, now it is 5 away from P's x coordinate. And in the vertical direction, in the vertical direction, in the y direction, it was 6 below P's y coordinate. Now it is 1 2 3rds times as far. It is 10 below P's y coordinate. So let's answer these questions. The length of segment AB, well we already saw that. That is, we're going from 3 to negative 3. That is 6 units long. And its image, well it's 1 and 2 3rds as long. We see it over here, we're going from 3 to negative 7. 3 minus negative 7 is 10. It is 10 units long. We got it right.
