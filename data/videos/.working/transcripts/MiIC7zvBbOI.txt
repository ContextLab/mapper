What we're gonna do in this video is get some practice graphing in polar coordinates. So I have three points here and some of them are given in degrees, some of them are given in radians for the angle. And we're gonna think about how to plot it on this, on these axes, or I guess you could say this graph paper here. And if you don't have any graph paper in front of you, I encourage you to at least pause the video before I plot it and at least point your finger on your screen to where you think I should plot it. All right, let's start with this first point, three 405 degrees. So 405 degrees is interesting because that's more than one full circle around, one revolution. 405 degrees is going to be equal to 360 degrees plus 45 degrees. So we're going to go all the way around, that's going to be 360, and then another 45, which would get us right to that little gray line right over there. And then it's the radius is three. So we're going to go one, two, three. So that is our point, three comma 405 degrees. Now our next one is in radians, and this one's interesting because the radius is negative. So I like to start with the angle as always. So three pi over four radians. So if this is pi over two, this is pi radians, we're going to be exactly halfway in between on this gray line right over here. But if our radius was two, we would go out one, two, but our radius isn't two, it's negative two. So we go backwards, we go one, two, right over there. All right, now four comma negative four pi over three. So let's think about where that would be. So here we're in radians and we have a negative angle. So we're going to go clockwise, negative four pi over three. So I always just like to think about that's four pi over three is equal to three pi over three plus pi over three. So it equals pi plus pi over three. And we're going to, and if we did put a negative here, we would say that. And so let us now go negative pi, that would take us over here. And then we want to go another negative pi over three. And my brain sometimes converts back and forth between radians and degrees. I remind myself, well, pi is 180 degrees, pi over three is 60 degrees. So that would get us, if we go another negative pi over three, we would get right over here to two pi over three. And another way to think about this, if you just took two pi, which is, you could use this as zero radians or two pi radians, you subtracted four pi over three. Let me do that over here. So two pi minus four pi over three. That's the same thing as six pi over three minus four pi over three, which is equal to two pi over three. And so that gets us to this angle right over here. And our radius is one, two, three, four. There we go. And then last but not least, we have both the negative angle and the negative radius. This should be fun. All right, let's do the angle first. So negative 100 degrees. If we view this as zero degrees, but it could also be viewed as 360 degrees if you made one full revolution, you're gonna subtract 100 degrees from that. So if you subtract 100 degrees from that, that would be the same thing as 260 degrees. So we get to this angle right over here. And if it was positive three, we would go one, one, two, three, but it's not, it's negative three. Let me make sure I'm following this properly. So if I follow this line backwards, I get to that line right over there. And so I'm going to go backwards one, two, three, and get to that point right over there. And we're done.
