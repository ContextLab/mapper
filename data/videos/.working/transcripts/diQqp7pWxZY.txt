In this video, we wanna prove that if a diameter of a circle bisects a chord, it is perpendicular to the chord. So we've drawn the first part. We have a diameter here and it is bisecting this chord and bisecting just means it splits it into two equal segments. So that's why we have the lines there. That's what the bisects tell us. And now how do we determine whether it's truly perpendicular? Well, what I'm gonna do is construct some triangles. So let me put some radii out here. So that's one radius and then that's another radius. This is a circle. So the length of the radius is always the same. So that length is equal to that length. And then we also know, of course, this side is equal to itself. So all of a sudden we have these two triangles that are congruent to each other. How do we know? Well, it's by side, side, side. They both share this side. They both have a side that is these double slashes and they both have the side that's on that bisected chord. So we know that these two triangles are congruent. Well, that means that corresponding angles are also going to be congruent. And let me do this in a new color. This angle, let's call that theta. The measure of this angle is theta. And let's call the measure of this angle phi. We know that these measures have to be equal to each other. That theta needs to be equal to phi because they're corresponding angles of two congruent triangles. But we also know because they're collinear that they're supplementary. We also know that theta plus phi is going to be equal to 180. Well, if theta equals phi, we could just substitute phi for theta here. And then we would get two theta is equal to 180, divide both sides by two, and you get theta is equal to 90. So theta is 90. And if phi is also equal to theta, they all equal 90. And so the diameter in question and the chord that it bisects, they are perpendicular. We have just shown that.
