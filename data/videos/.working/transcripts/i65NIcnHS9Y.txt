Let's think about the payoff diagram for just owning the stock, or we could say going long the stock, which is really just owning it. If we think about just the underlying asset value, and we're talking about the value at some date, and you know, traditionally we're talking about some maturity date for some options, but the value at maturity, but it's some date we have in our mind. So if we're thinking about just the value, if on that date the underlying stock price is 50, then the value of holding the stock is going to be 50. If the value of the underlying stock is 0, then the value of owning the stock is going to be 0. If the value of the underlying stock is 70, then the value of the stock is going to be 70. So you just have this very simple line payoff diagram. It's just whatever the underlying stock price, that is the value of the asset, because you just own the stock. If you think about it from a profit and loss point of view, you break even if on that day, since you're paying $50 per share for it today, if on whatever date we're talking about, the stock price at some future date, at maturity for some type of option, you paid 50, if the value is 50, then you're at break even. If the value is at 0, then you just lost $50, so you're going to be at negative 50 over here. If the value of the stock price on that date goes to 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, then you just made $50, so it's going to be this point right up here. Your profit will be 50, so you see a payoff diagram that looks something like this. Once again, the only difference between this payoff diagram and that payoff diagram is that this one right here is shifted down by $50 to incorporate the price that you paid for it. Now, this is what happens if you just buy the stock. Let's say you want to buy the stock, but you want to mitigate your downside risk. You want to buy some insurance on your stock. You want to mitigate the downside. What you can do is you can literally just also buy a put option, maybe with a strike price right at 50. You want to mitigate your downside if the stock goes below 50. If you do that, and I'll only do it on this payoff diagram, you could just shift it down for this one, what would it look like? Well, just the put options payoff diagram looks like this. We've already drawn...let me do that in the color of the put option. We've already done that in a previous video. It looks something like this. If the underlying stock price is zero, then the put option is worth 50 because you can buy it for zero, buy the stock for zero, and then you have the right to sell it for 50. Then the value of the put option, it's worthless if the stock can actually be sold for 50, then you wouldn't exercise the put option. What happens if you own both? If you own both at maybe the maturity of the option, if the stock is worth zero, your stock part is worth zero, but the option is worth 50. The combination is going to be worth 50. If the stock is worth 25, then the put option is also worth 25. If you own both of them, the combination is going to be worth 50. If the stock is worth 50, the put option is worth zero. You own the combination, it's going to be worth 50. Anything above 50, the put option is just worth zero, but then you have the value of the stock. The stock plus the put would look like this payoff diagram right over here. When you look at this, what happened is we'll get all of the upside if the stock goes above 50, but we've mitigated our downside. This right here is the stock plus the put option. What you see here is that the put is acting as insurance. When people talk about buying insurance on a position, they're usually talking about buying a put option. If we were to draw the same graph over here, we would shift it down by the amount you pay for the stock and for the $10 that you're paying for the put option. You would shift this graph down by $60 because that's what it costs to go into this position.
