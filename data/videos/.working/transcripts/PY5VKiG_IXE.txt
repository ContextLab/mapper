Sal Khan lives in California outside of San Francisco. Sarah Shadid halfway around the globe in Dubai. Their lives are interconnected but Khan doesn't know it. This is a story about how one man is helping to educate the world but has never seen any of his students face to face. Where does this passion come from? I think I've always enjoyed teaching. It's about a man who gave up a lucrative career in Silicon Valley for what might look like a boring desk job. Right now I'm cash flow negative. But it was never about money and with his drive and education, Khan could have made millions. He was valedictorian of his high school with a perfect math score on the SAT. Then came MIT, Bill Clinton handing him his diploma. Next, Harvard Business School. He was lured into hedge funds and did well. But Khan, who has a wife and son to support, gave it up. A lot of people thought I was kind of crazy. Obviously, you know, when every waking hour you have, you would sneak into a room and make math videos and put them on YouTube. People kind of question, you know, what's up. Here's what's up. Khan's YouTube videos. Let's do a couple more examples and I think you might get it. They've been clicked on more than 9 million times from users around the world. The topics range from math to chemistry to economics. From every curriculum they can use the videos. He's really helpful. One of his users, 19-year-old college sophomore Sarah Shadid in Dubai. She says the videos made all the difference in helping her conquer calculus. Before each and every exam, like I take two days checking all of his videos and understanding the small details he explains. This gigantic virtual school originates from the smallest of places. From a tiny converted closet inside Saul's master bedroom. This is where he's able to reach an estimated 80,000 knowledge-seeking users a month. It all started a few years ago when a cousin wanted some online math tutoring. Pretty soon other relatives started asking for similar help. Suddenly, people he didn't know started watching. People must have put in math terms and suddenly they find you. Yeah, I think it's just completely right. It's that small subset of people who go to YouTube and do a web search for greatest common divisor. People did it and it caught on. It's now called the Khan Academy. The videos are short and simply produced. Only his voice. So that's your slope of the system. With a simple black background and graphics. There are a lot of people who need help with their math, science, whatever. And I think they find these YouTube videos as kind of the ideal nuggets to fill in their gaps. These many classes filled in Sarah Chagid's gaps who says she and her friends refer to Khan as the man with the colored fonts. Whatever you call him or his teachings, the success of this site has validated that decision to walk away from hedge funds. Dan Simon, CNN, San Francisco.
