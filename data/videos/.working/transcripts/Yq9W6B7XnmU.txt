You're having a movie marathon. Each movie lasts about 1 3 fourths hours. If you want to watch three movies, how long will your movie marathon last? You can use the number line below to help you find your answer. So each movie lasts 1 3 fourths hours long. So let's say the first movie happens to be Star Wars, which I probably would include in any movie marathon. So it's going to be 1 3 fourths hours long. Let's see. This is 1 1, and then we're going to have 3 fourths more. So each of these are a fourth, because we have four sections between 1 and 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. So we're going to watch 3 fourths. 1, 2, 3. So that's how long my first movie is. And then my second movie is going to be another 1 and 3 fourths. So 1 is 4 fourths. So 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we're going to have another 3 fourths. And just as a way I said that, 4 fourths and 3 fourths is 7 fourths. So 1 and 3 fourths, that's the same thing as 7 fourths. And you see that over here. When I did the 1 and 3 fourths in blue, I actually marked off 7 fourths. Same thing here in magenta. And now let's do it in green. So Gandhi is actually a good bit longer than 1 and 3 fourths. But it's a good movie, so I put it here just because it's one of my favorite. And so let's do another 1 and 3 fourths hours. Or we could do that as 4 fourths plus 3 fourths hours, or 7 fourths. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So that gets us to 5. So this point right over here is 5 and 1 fourths hours. Let's see if we get that same result when we do it mathematically. I guess this is mathematical as well. But every movie lasts 1 and 3 fourths hours. We already said that 1 and 3 fourths is the same thing as 1 plus 3 fourths. It's the same thing. 1 is the same thing as 4 fourths. So it's 4 fourths plus 3 fourths, which is the same thing as 7 fourths. And another way to convert this mixed number into an improper fraction, you say, hey, look. 4 times 1 is 4. And that's really where you're getting the 4 fourths from. Plus 3 is 7. 7 fourths. Now, we're going to do 7 fourths of an hour 3 times. So we're going to multiply 7 fourths times 3. Now, there's several ways that you could think about this. You could literally view this as having 3 7 fourths and adding them together. So 7 fourths plus 7 fourths plus 7 fourths, which would be equal to 21 over 4. And if you wanted to convert this into a mixed number, 21 over 4 is the same thing as, well, 4 goes into 20 evenly. So you could call this 20 over 4 plus 1 over 4. And 20 over 4 is the same thing as 5. So it's 5 and 1, 5 and 1 fourth, which is exactly what we saw here. Another way of thinking about it, you could say 7 fourths. And then we can multiply it by 3 over 1 times 3 over 1. Just to make it clear that we're multiplying the numerators and multiplying the denominators. So in the numerator, I'm going to have 7 plus 7 plus 7. That's 7 times 3. And the denominator, I'm going to have 4 times 1, which is just 4. Well, this is just 7 times 3 over 4, or 21 over 4, which we've already seen is 5 and 1 fourth.
