Solve for p. So we have negative 3p minus 7 is less than p plus 9. So let's isolate the p's on one side of this equation. We could do it on the left-hand side. So to do that, we want to get rid of this p right over here. So let's subtract p from both sides. So I am subtracting p from both sides of this inequality. The left-hand side, negative 3p minus p, well, that's going to be negative 4p minus 7 is less than or equal to, or no, sorry, just less than, not less than or equal to, is just less than p minus p is 0. So we just have a 9 over here. And then we can add, if we want to isolate the p's, we can add 7 to both sides to get rid of this negative 7 over here. So let's add 7 to both sides of this equation. Sorry, this inequality. It's not an equation. It's an inequality. And we have negative 4p minus 7 plus 7, those cancel out, is less than 9 plus 7, which is 16. Now, if we want to isolate the p, if we want to get rid of this negative 4 coefficient, we want to multiply both sides of the inequality by its inverse, by negative 1 fourth. Another way we could think about it, we could divide both sides of this inequality by negative 4. But we have to remember, if you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to swap the inequality. So let me do it this way. Negative 4p over negative 4. And we have 16 over negative 4. So I just divided both sides by negative 4. But since I'm dividing by a negative number, or if I had multiplied by a negative number, this is equivalent to multiplying by negative 1 fourth, I have to swap the inequality. It goes from less than to being greater than. And now this negative 4 cancels to negative 4. We have p is greater than 16 divided by negative 4 is negative 4. And we could have done it another way. We could have grouped all of the p's on the right-hand side of the equation. Let me do that, just to show you there's multiple ways to do this. So you have negative 3p minus 7 is less than p plus 9. Let's group the p's on the right-hand side. So we could add 3p to both sides. So let's add 3p to both sides. So we get just a negative 7 is less than p plus 3p is 4p plus 9. Now we can subtract 9 from both sides to get rid of that 9 over there. And so we will get negative 7 minus 9 is negative 16 is less than 4p. And now we can divide both sides by a positive 4. So we just have a p on the right-hand side. So we divide both sides by a positive number. You don't swap the inequality. So we just want to divide both sides by a positive 4. And so the left-hand side becomes negative 4 is less than 4p over 4 is just p. So we get p is greater than negative 4, or negative 4 is less than p, which is the exact same thing we have over here. p is greater than negative 4, or negative 4 is less than p. And so let's graph it here. Let's graph our solution. So it would look like this. Maybe we have negative 5, negative 4, negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1. And so p is greater than negative 4. p is greater than negative 4. So we're not going to include negative 4, because it's not a greater than or equal. So we have to put a open circle around negative 4. But then we're going to include all the values greater than that. So we're going to go to the right. And then let's just verify that this makes reasonable amount of sense. Let's find something that should work. So negative 3 is included. Let's verify that negative 3 works. So if we have negative 3 times negative 3, so that's the negative 3, and for p I'm putting in negative 3, minus 7, it should be less than negative 3 plus 9. So this is 9 minus 7, which is 2, is less than negative 3 plus 9 is 6. This is true. So negative 3 definitely worked. Negative 5 should not work. Let's verify that. Negative 3 times negative 5 minus 7. Let's see how that relates. Well, let's see if this is true. Whether it's less than negative 5 plus 9. So this is positive 15 minus 7 is 8. 8 is less than negative 5 plus 9 is 4. This is not true. It is not less than 4. So negative 5 does not work. So at least from one point that's outside of the solution set, it definitely did not work. And one point that was in the solution set, it did work. So we're feeling pretty good about our solution.
