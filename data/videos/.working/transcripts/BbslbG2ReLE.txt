Hello everyone. Good afternoon. We are slowly welcoming folks into the room. Thanks for taking the time to join us My name is Philippe Escamilla. I'm the video manager here at Khan Academy Shortly, we will be joined by Sal Khan the CEO and founder of Khan Academy You'll tell you a little bit about our mission Our AI tool and teacher assistant and student tutor called Khan Migo We also have two senior product managers that will be joining us at Gintas Brodhanas and Sarah Robertson I'm gonna go ahead and introduce Sarah and Gintas now tell you a little bit about their roles And what they do here Khan Academy and some of the things a little preview what they'll be presenting today. Hi Sarah. Hi Gintas Hey Philippe. Welcome everybody. I'm Sarah Robertson as Philippe mentioned. I am a senior product manager here at Khan Academy I am a former English teacher many years ago Also previously worked for common lit another edtech nonprofit company and I've been at Khan Academy now for a little over a year Mostly I've been focusing on our literacy related initiatives So building out content and tools and resources for ELA and humanities teachers most exciting thing that we've been working on lately is our writing coach tool, which I will show you in In detail in a little bit and I'll let Gintas share about himself. Sure. Thanks Sarah. Hi everyone. My name is Gintas I'm a senior product manager on our teacher experience team And like Sarah I was a teacher in a past life. So I was a middle school English teacher taught sixth and seventh grade ELA and then got pulled into the world of product and My team as the name suggests is focus Primarily on everything and anything we can do to make the lives of teachers easier And to make it possible for teachers to of course get help their students reach their their learning goals and their needs So it's a it's a fun team to be on. It's got a lot of other former educators on it Also a lot of English teachers. We do go down the rabbit hole sometimes with our metaphors. So Yeah, really excited to show you today about our Khan Amigo tools And what we've been working on to make on me go the ideal Teachers assistant. I just wanted to thank everyone for joining I'll just give a little bit of a background and then hand it over to the Khan Academy team to go Much deeper into things but I'm assuming most folks here are somewhat familiar with Khan Academy nonprofit mission free world-class education for anyone anywhere and probably a lot of y'all know how Khan Academy got started and I used to Talk about the origin story just as a fun quirky way that I got involved in Khan Academy But I now talk about it because I think it's very relevant to to some of what we're going to talk about with AI and beyond You know back in the day, I started tutoring cousins words present my family free tutoring is going on before I know what I'm tutoring Many cousins I start trying to scale those types of personalized one-on-one interactions I I start making writing exercises for them teacher tools I was the first user of the teacher tools so that I could keep track of what students were doing and make assignments to my To my cousins a friend suggested I make videos once again That was a way to scale some of these mini lessons that I was giving for my cousins And then you fast forward to now or a couple of years ago Khan Academy is obviously now much more than than me But as a not-for-profit what we've really everything we've been doing even though we're now at 160 million plus users is that same idea. How do we really try to scale the type of attention Personalization mastery learning which is just that if students haven't learned something yet They should get more of an opportunity incentive to learn it how do we scale that to more and more students and How do we support teachers and educators and school leaders and superintendents in order to better support their students and all of those things? So, you know, those were the teacher tools and the professional development that we've run over the years you fast forward to About a year and a half ago and this is when open AI first reached out to us We were curious but skeptical We've been monitoring what's been going on in the AI world for a while It didn't seem ready for prime time at least in 2022 but then when we saw what GPT for could do and just to give a little bit of Clarification on some of the terminology a lot of people know chat GPT Chat GPT is an application that they later created originally on an older model Now you could access it on GPT for if you pay money But the models are the GPT 3 GPT 4 Google has models like Gemini, etc And then you have the applications But when we saw what GPT 4 was capable of even though it had its rough spots We said wow This could get us that much further to being able to scale the type of personalization That we want to do for students and it could be that much more powerful for supporting teachers All of these tasks that teachers need to do Clearly they have to get reporting on how their students are doing but they also are doing things like lesson plans Exit tickets progress reports, etc, etc Maybe it could be part of it could be a tutor for every student and a teaching assistant for every teacher So that's the journey we started to go on. There's obviously a lot of questions about how you handle safety privacy Cheating and and we're working on all of those and we think we have good answers but we're going to show you is especially many of the tools that are teacher facing that we're very excited about and we've recently done a Pretty significant revamp and we've made it far more accessible to a lot more educators But also recognize that this is a journey that we're hoping that many of y'all want to go on with us that it can be immediately useful to you right now But as y'all use it and we learn from how you're using it We can make it better and better so that we can support you and we can support your students So with that, I'll pass it to the team so they can show you a little bit of what we've been up to Alright, thanks. I will get us started with our teacher tools So this is our new con we go teacher tools page as I mentioned in the introduction I am a former middle school English teacher and My team's charge is quite simply to make the lives of teachers easier And when we all think back to our teaching days I still say it's the hardest job that I ever did that any of us ever did and the only way a teacher Often can make it through their teaching experience is by leaning on others by leaning on their support network So in my case, it was a lot of other first second third year teachers. It was a veteran teacher across the hall Mrs. Hall who I could see into her classroom and brainstorm ideas for the lesson the next day And so I'm building out can we go we want to add another piece to that support network So in the same way you would go across the hall to ask a teacher for ideas You can now go to can we go and work with can we go to make your lessons better to come up with? Ideas on how to make sure you're engaging your students So to show you what this might look like I can go in here and say I have a lesson tomorrow that I'm teaching And I'm already dreading it because it is what I know is A topic that my students Don't necessarily love all that much and in this case, let's say it's adding fractions It's a topic that my students might not find all that engaging But we are in Baltimore and Baltimore for once has a really good baseball team So I'm gonna say my class There's a question of baseball fans. They're actually Orioles fans and I'm gonna say can there can you make it relevant to my students? Who might care more about baseball than adding fractions? And so this would be the same idea of you know, going across all way and being like hey What did you do with your class yesterday? That was so cool. Why were they so engaged? Why were they so into your lesson and here we can see a couple ideas on using baseball card statistics averages to teach fractions And this is great But of course, I'm a little bit biased I'm a baseball fan myself and that might not apply to all of my students. And so this is where it really gets exciting using conmigo where conmigo is really your partner here and can work with you to customize the content and fit the needs of students, so Looking at this I can ask conmigo to make changes to this try something different discuss this in this case I'm gonna say make changes to this and I know that in my class. I have a couple Taylor Swift fans, so I'm gonna say make this about Taylor Swift instead and I have no idea how this is going to work because I have no idea how you connect Taylor Swift to Fractions and conmigo will give me some ideas here possibly tying it to track lengths collaborations to her sales there was a previous case where kind of ego gave me an example of Finding fractions in the lyrics of Taylor Swift. These are ideas. I would never come up with or never had if I wasn't You know brainstorming with kind of ego. So First and foremost kind of ego is a great thought partner It's also a great lesson plan partner if I go here and I select lesson plan I can say you know adding fractions and it will pull from our content Here on Khan Academy and so I'll see adding and subtracting negative fractions create lesson plan and it will Create a full five-part lesson plan that includes differentiation And this is where our prompt engineering team a lot of former educators on that team have worked To design an experience where can we go is providing the strategies that your fellow teacher would Suggest to another teacher to include in their classrooms last but certainly not least can we go can also do things like recommend assignments, so if I'm Maybe for class just thinking about what I should be working with my students They might have been working on a couple topics, but I'm not really sure what's next I always had questions about you know, scope and sequence and what makes sense to teach after what? I can just ask on me go in this case and can we go give me a couple ideas as to what to work with my students on tomorrow and say assigned to group one and I can assign it directly from can we go and that will be in my students accounts the next day For them to be working on so really really excited about where? Can we go has gone in terms of the teacher use case? Really useful already today. We as a team had whiteboards upon whiteboards of future tools and ideas on where to take can be going next So stay tuned for that But that's my update for today and I will pass it over to Sarah to share a little bit more about writing coach Thanks, Gintas. All right. So I think most of you know Khan Academy is very well known for its Its stem content. It's excellent videos and articles and exercises and mastery learning We are really excited about some of the advancements that we're seeing when it comes to AI and ELA and humanities And we've been working really hard in the past year at applying some of this this innovation and this opportunity to the ELA and humanities teacher use cases So what I'm going to share is a project that we're calling writing coach This is something that is not available quite yet. We are launching it for this back-to-school season Right now there is a feature that is kind of a preview of writing coach that you can see if you have kind of you go access For students and that's called our academic essay feedback activity But I'm going to give you a preview of what writing coach will look like this back-to-school season in a moment But really quick if you and I think many of you are probably familiar with this Quandary of writing instruction in schools right now research tells us that students need to be spending 60 minutes a day Writing in classrooms middle and high school students fewer than 10% of students are actually reaching that goal We also know that in order to improve in writing instruction students need specific actionable feedback on their writing that is delivered as Timely in a timely a manner as possible. This is almost never what happens in reality And as a result teachers don't assign quite enough writing They get super burnt out if they even try to provide personalized feedback on every essay So it's kind of no wonder that students are behind in their writing skills As I mentioned earlier, I'm a former English teacher assigning one Essay to my hundred students would take 17 hours for me to provide personalized feedback on all their essays. So what I think is particularly exciting about writing coach is First of all the features that it provides for students So one thing that we know is obviously students need feedback in order to become better writers But many of the teachers that we've spoken to have told us, you know It's great that your your current feedback tool gives feedback on essays But I can't even get most of my students to the point where they have a first draft that whole getting started piece Outlining it's like pulling teeth. It is really hard to even get students to produce something to begin with and I also Like that was that was my experience as well I remember that moment of looking around and students just feeling so stuck. So with the writing coach tool It actually supports students through the entire writing process from the very beginning The very first step that writing coach does is it talks to the student? Can you go will talk to the student about the essay prompt? It will make sure that they understand what the expectations are and then if there are any words that they're unfamiliar with Can you go will help them understand, you know, what is a rebuttal? How do I write a counter argument those kinds of things? So this preview right here shows that initial prompt review stage before the student even begins writing where they have a casual and Kind of low-pressure conversation with Kanmigo to get them thinking about the essay assignment And then of course one of the next steps is outlining so one of the benefits of having Kanmigo support students through the outlining process is Kanmigo knows what the teacher's assignment was so Kanmigo knows how many paragraphs the teacher expects What kind of citations the teacher wants to see, you know What sort of details they want students to include and when the student is working on their outline Kanmigo can make sure that they're on track and if the student has questions Kanmigo knows how to respond and if you have students who are Completely lost when it comes to writing a thesis Kanmigo has been trained to support students through writing and drafting these different elements of an outline without actually doing any of that work for them When it comes to drafting Obviously Kanmigo now has the students outline that it worked on with the students So it can help the student kind of plug that into their draft and flesh it out more And of course like with all other features, it will not do the writing for the student But it's there if they get stuck and they need a little bit of help There's also other things happening behind the scenes as the students drafting that the student can't always see that you will see in a moment on the teacher end and For revising the student can submit their draft to Kanmigo for feedback Kanmigo generates suggestions in five main feedback areas that are aligned to most major rubrics Students can ask Kanmigo about the feedback that they got but most excitingly they can also Revise their essay on the page and get Follow-up feedback from Kanmigo in real time so they can find out immediately did my suggestion did my revision Address the suggestion that you gave me And for teachers, I think this is where writing coach where the magic really starts to show so because students are interacting with Kanmigo through the whole writing process we are then able to Synthesize that and report it back to the teacher and give them really helpful insights into what students were able to do what they struggled with So some of the things that teachers will be able to see Include, you know, of course where where in the assignment every student is so so-and-so is working on their outline This person's already in revising. They can see how much time was spent drafting versus revising or outlining versus drafting They can see current word count. They can see High level data about the feedback distribution. So, you know, most students got feedback related to evidence Maybe that's something that you should focus on for instruction later and then these potential originality concerns or these flags So these are the things that I mentioned when a student is drafting or even outlining or revising If they're pasting a large amount of text into The experience and Kanmigo doesn't know where it came from. It didn't come from the outline or didn't come from that conversation We will raise a flag for the teacher that they can then go in and investigate and see exactly what was pasted See what happened kind of dig into that which from the conversations i've had with teachers having to do this You know using google docs or you know draft back chrome extensions one student at a time can be unbelievably time consuming in itself and with chat gpt I think this is a As big of a problem as as teachers have ever seen so we are really excited About the the student benefits of writing coach But then also a lot of these teacher features that will come with that Before we go to sal for questions because i'm sure you have a lot of stuff for him Just want to let me know that uh, I head up our uh, partnerships team here at con academy working with schools school districts And now even states on some level uh to partner for our con academy districts offering as well as konbigo So a lot of our content and tools are free and totally Accessible for your students and teachers to use just about every district in the country Has their teachers using the free version of con academy because it's a fantastic supplemental resource Um, if you want additional letters of support and you want your students to have access to konmigo, you can partner with my team Uh, which is the con academy districts a partnership team to allow you to basically get support for con academy courses and content but also Uh, let your students and teacher access konmigo Student access for konmigo is only available as part of our um district partnerships Um, and so the the way it works is you're basically going to get Rostering services you're going to get data analytics and you're going to get professional learning both for the core kon academy offering But also for konmigo And the professional learning is really key because obviously this ai is new to all of us So we want to make sure this is a journey we're going through together that we have really robust professional learning resources For you as part of our district partnership Our partnerships start as small as 250 students So if you're a smaller district or maybe your larger district and just wanted to dip your toe in the water We can partner for as few as 250 student licenses up through as many as you would like We only charge for the student licenses So if you're partnering for us at the district offering and paying for the student licenses, the teacher licenses are going to be free Which is great Um, and again, like we talked about there's the implementation support Where we're going to hold your hand and walk you through kind of best practices how to leverage kon academy how to leverage konmigo Train your teachers train your staff train your admin so that everybody's on board for how the platform should be used I will say that professional learning with konmigo is mandatory because this is so new And everybody's learning as we go. We insist that you have some sort of pl as part of the partnership with us And the pl is going to depend on the scope of the partnership for the smaller partnerships That might to be on-demand pd that your teachers can do async Up through live virtual hours and even recommended in-person pl days that we can come out to your district and train your staff depending on the pl calendar But the idea here is we want to support everyone support all your teachers and kind of best practices with ai konmigo So that your students and teachers are getting the most out of the platform And if you're interested Two things you can do here You can email us directly at districts icon academy.org or there's a qr code here Which will take you to our district's landing page, which has a bunch of information about our district offering konmigo, etc So we're on standby now. My team's ready to help But whether you just want a more detailed demo We're happy to provide that or more detailed information on pricing happy to provide that with either one of these touch points But looking forward to speaking with you If you have any questions and now i'd love to throw it back to south we have as much time as possible with with him to answer your questions Thanks, Jason, so yes, I and others here not just me happy to answer any questions Uh and any ideas that y'all might have We do have a couple questions that are in right now Um, does the writing coach have the capabilities to create text-based writing prompts where excerpts are Inserted for students to read and to analyze. I do want to go a little bit more in depth with that One thing i'll say is that we specifically do support literary analysis essays Um, you know structurally I think konmigo does a very good job at helping students with that if the essay is about Anything that is well known that was published prior to 2023, which is when gbt4's knowledge base goes up to Um, then students actually get support from konmigo analyzing the text So if the student is like I really don't understand this theme or this character or you know Something that happened in the story konmigo is aware of of that text and can support them with that So, um, you can't actually upload your own text yet Although I think we will be able to support something like that fairly soon But it can help students if the texts are fairly well known and then also there's a question. Do we have a dsa? We have versions of that with multiple districts um, most of the day sharing agreements that i'm familiar with are the ones where We have partnered with the school district and we want to understand the efficacy results Better. Uh, so we have several districts there and so that way we can help analyze Whether we are hopefully moving the dial the way that many of our efficacy studies, um indicate that they would but uh, yeah, we we are obviously you know, we have I think we're the leaders when it comes to data privacy, um and and solid use of data Only using it to personalize experience measure efficacy Etc. Uh, but uh, yes Yeah, john, you can email the districts at con academy.org email address and we'd sort out with you. We have state level agreements We have consortium agreements, uh, dsa's and dpa's we provide directly to districts as well So we can definitely sort you out But sal maybe it's useful to talk about what you know What we share or don't share with open ai in terms of that learning and usage on the platform in terms of the data sharing And student usage sure and i'll yeah i'll speak a little bit generally about data when Obviously, there's a lot of opportunity with artificial intelligence, but there's there's some fears here Um, there's a cheating fear. There's a fear of students doing shady things with the ai and then there's fears of Do these conversations somehow get incorporated into the training data for future models? And so could that somehow? create a data privacy risk For especially with something very sensitive like student data. So i'll go in that order It's already been alluded to for students con academy does not support it will not just answer the question It really acts as an ethical tutor We can seriously do a little bit of this There's a ted talk I gave last year that goes into a lot more depth on that But we're very clear now for student teachers have a teacher mode Uh, and they can if they put it on student mode They see what students would see if they put it in teacher mode It actually not only supports teachers with answers it acts like a super teacher's guide It can help them with all the things that gintis was showing lesson plans lesson hooks, etc, etc another area a guardrail that we have or is When students interact with conmigo those interactions are all observable by teachers and then we also have a moderation Api or a moderation aii. So if the student has a conversation, you know, they're saying they want to Heaven forbid build a bomb or they they want to harm themselves or it's going to shut down those conversations and actively notify uh teachers and administrators Now the data and this is a principle for con academy well before Gender of ai is that we only use data and this is one of the reasons we're not for profit So we're not even tempted to try to monetize data in some shady way. We only use data to measure our impact personalize the experience improve the experience or inform Key trusted stakeholders like teachers Or districts those are our only uses for data. So when it comes into the ai realm As I just mentioned we are storing the student conversations We're only using that for teacher reporting or our own evaluation of what is happening and how we can make it better we do not Allow those conversations and these are agreements that we have with the underlying ai companies That data cannot be used for the general purpose training of future models So none of students private private information can make its way into let's call it the public realm We might use that information to fine tune or train our own versions to once again Personalize or be more effective for students, but once again that will stay within this garden of con academy Not for the broader world. So we take that Very very seriously and you know to be clear. There's a ton of people If we were a for-profit company Every day I have some ai company offering to pay us for that data and we are saying no uh, so You could imagine what might be happening if our if our um governance was a little bit different Yeah, and sal brings up a great point as you all are looking at ai products Whether it's konmigo or the other companies out there. I would really encourage you to actually read privacy policies There's these companies are popping up every day. There's tons of startups out there. We don't know who's behind them We don't know if there's education educational folks looking at the pedagogy and learning of this There's a bunch of folks out there right now whose names you will know go read their privacy policies and they specifically say We will not share or sell student data unless we get acquired or go out of business Which is going to be 95 of these companies, right? And so what are they going to do when they start running out of money or they do they're acquired Do they have those same guardrails that a company like con academy does in terms of sharing? So be very careful as you're looking at products in the space right now what they are doing in terms of data sharing data privacy data governance Because I think it's really key decision making a choice for you at all for y'all Thank you all for joining us today and watching this video and being a part of the con academy Learner and teacher community if you'd like to see more about how conmigo is supercharging learning in classrooms right now Click on the links on your screen and to stay in touch and never miss an announcement about free world-class education for anyone anywhere Be sure to subscribe
