Dia thought it would be nice to include 2 21sts of a pound of chocolate in each of the holiday gift bags she made for her friends and family. So Dia is very precise. She wants exactly 2 21sts of a pound of chocolate. How many holiday gift bags could Dia make with 2 thirds of a pound of chocolate? So we really just need to think about what's the total amount of chocolate she has. So what's the total pounds? And we just have to divide it by the pounds she wants per bag. And then you will get the number of bags. If she had 6 total pounds and she wanted 2 pounds per bag, she would be able to make 3 bags. And so we just do the same thing over here. But over here, her total number of pounds, it's a slightly hairier number, it's 2 thirds. So her total pounds are 2 thirds of a pound. We want to divide that by how many pounds she wants to put in each bag. So that would be 2 21sts of a pound. And this will give us the number of bags. Now, when we divide fractions like this, so we can rewrite this expression. This is the same thing as 2 thirds divided by 2 21sts, 2 over 21. Which we've learned is the same thing as 2 thirds times the reciprocal of 2 21sts. Which is just 21 over 2. All we did is we swapped the numerator and the denominator. We took the reciprocal here. When you divide by a fraction, it's like multiplying by its reciprocal. And this is equal to, and there's other videos we were going to, the idea behind that. We just have to multiply this out. And our numerator, and I won't even multiply it out. And our numerator, we get 2 times 21. I'll do a new color here. 2 times 21, when I multiply the numerators. And the denominator, I get 3 times 2. And now we can simplify it before we even multiply it out. Divide the numerator and the denominator by a common factor. They're both divisible by 2. They are both divisible by 2. So let's divide both the numerator and denominator by 2. And the numerator and denominator are both divisible by 3. One's divisible by 3, and 3 is divisible by 3. So let's also divide them both by 3. So when you divide the numerator by 2, so this 2 and this 2 cancels out. And then 21 divided by 3, you're just left with 7. Down here, you have 2 divided by 2 cancels out, and 3 divided by 3 cancels out. And so you're left with 7 over 1, or exactly 7, 7 bags.
