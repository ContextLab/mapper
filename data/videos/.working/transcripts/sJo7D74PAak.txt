Hey everyone, so in the last video I introduced this thing called the second partial derivative test And if you have some kind of multivariable function or really just a two variable function is what this applies to Something that's f of x y and it outputs a number When you're looking for places where it has a local maximum or a local minimum The first step as I talked about a few videos ago is to find where the gradient equals zero and sometimes you'll hear these called Critical points or stable points but inputs where the gradient equals zero and that's really just a way of Compactly writing the fact that all the partial derivatives are equal to zero Now when you find a point like this in order to test whether it's a local maximum or a local minimum or a saddle point Without actually looking at the graph because you don't always have the ability to do that at your disposal The first step is to compute this long value and this is the thing I want to give intuition behind Where you take all three second partial derivatives the second partial derivative with respect to x the second partial derivative with respect to y And the mixed partial derivative where first you do it with respect to x then you do it with respect to y And you compute this value where you evaluate each one of those at your critical point and you Multiply the two pure second partial derivatives and then subtract off the square of the mixed partial derivative and again I'll give intuition for that in a reason but right now we just kind of take it Oh, all right I guess you compute this number and if that value h if that value h is greater than zero What it tells you what it tells you is that you definitely have either a maximum or a minimum So you definitely have either a maximum or a minimum and then to determine which one you just have to look at the concavity In one direction, so you'll look at the second partial derivative with respect to x for example And if that was positive that would tell you when you look in the x direction There's a positive concavity if it was negative it would mean a negative concavity And so that means a positive value for that second partial derivative would mean a local minimum and a negative value would mean a local maximum So that's that's what it means if this value h turns out to be greater than zero and if this value h Turns out to be less than zero strictly less than zero then you definitely have a saddle point Saddle point which is neither a maximum nor minimum. It's kind of like there's disagreement in different directions over whether it should be a maximum or minimum And if h equals zero the test isn't good enough you would have to do something else to figure it out So why does this work? Why does this seemingly random? Conglomeration of second partial derivatives give you a test that lets you determine what type of stable point you're looking at well Let's just understand each term individually so this second partial derivative with respect to x since you're taking both partial derivatives with respect to x You're basically treating the entire multivariable function as if x is the only variable and y was just some constant So it's like you're only looking at movement in the x direction so in terms of a graph Let's say we've got like this graph here You can imagine slicing this with a plane that represents movement purely in the x direction So that'll be a constant y value slice and you take a look at the curve where this slice Intersects your graph and the one that I have pictured here. It looks like it's a positive concavity So so this term right here kind of tells you x concavity so it's kind of like the What is the concavity as far as the variable x is concerned and then symmetrically this over here when you take the partial derivative with respect? To y two times in a row It's like you're ignoring the fact that x is even a variable and you're looking purely at what movement in the y direction looks like Which on the graph that I have pictured here? Also happens to give you kind of this positive concavity parabola look But the point is that the curve on the graph that results from looking at movement purely in the y direction Can be analyzed just looking at this partial derivative with respect to y twice in a row So that term kind of tells you y concavity y concavity now first of all notice what happens if these disagree if say x thought there should be positive concavity and y thought there should be Negative concavity here. I'll write that down what that means if x thinks there's positive concavity We have here some kind of positive number that I'll just write as like a plus sign in parentheses And then this here y concavity would be some kind of negative number So I'll just put like a negative sign in parentheses So that would mean this very first term would be a positive times a negative and that first term would be negative and now the thing That we're subtracting off. I'll get to the intuition behind this next partial derivative term in a moment But for now you can notice that it's something squared. It's something that's always a positive term So you're always subtracting off a positive term which means if this initial one is negative the entire term h is definitely going to be negative So it's going to put you over into this saddle point territory Which makes sense because if the x direction the y direction disagree on concavity That should be a saddle point the quintessential example here is when you have when you have the function f of x y is equal to x squared minus y squared x squared minus y squared and the graph of that by the way the graph of that would look like this Where let's see so orienting myself here moving in the x direction you have kind of positive concavity which corresponds to the Positive coefficient in front of x squared and in the y direction It looks like negative concavity corresponding to that negative coefficient in front of the y squared So when there's disagreement among these the test ensures that we're going to have a saddle point now What about if they agree right what if either? It's the case that x thinks there should be positive concavity and y thinks there should be positive concavity or they both Agree that there should be you know negative concavity in either one of these cases when you multiply them together They're positive so it's kind of like saying if you look purely in the x direction or purely in the y direction They agree that there should be you know definitely positive concavity or definitely negative concavity So that entire first term is going to be positive So it's kind of like a clever way of capturing whether or not the x directions and y directions agree However, the reason that it's not enough is because in either case we're still subtracting off something. That's always a positive term So when you have this agreement between the x direction and a y direction it then turns into a battle between this XY agreement and whatever is going on with this mixed partial derivative term and The stronger that mixed partial derivative term the bigger this negative number So the more it's pulling the entire value h towards being negative So let me see if I can give a little bit of reasoning behind why this mixed partial derivative term is trying to pull things Towards being a saddle point. Let's take a look at the very simple function f of xy XY is equal to x times y So what that looks like graphically f of xy equals x times y is this it looks like a saddle point So Let's go ahead and look at its partial derivatives So the the first partial derivatives partial with respect to x and partial with respect to y Well when you do it with respect to x x looks like a variable y looks like a constant It's just that constant y and when you do it with respect to y it goes the other way around y looks like the variable x Looks like the constant so the derivative is that constant x now when you take the second partial derivatives If you do it with respect to x twice in a row You're differentiating this with respect to x that looks like a constant so you get zero And similarly if you do it with respect to y twice in a row You're doing this And the derivative of x with respect to y x looks like a constant goes to zero But the important term the one that we're getting an intuition about here this Mixed partial derivative first with respect to x then with respect to y well You can view it in two ways either you take the derivative of this expression with respect to y in which case it's 1 Or you think of taking the derivative of this expression with respect to x in which case it's also 1 So it's kind of like this This function is a very pure way to take a look at what this mixed partial derivative term looks like and the higher the coefficient Here if I had put a coefficient of you know 3 here that would mean that the mixed partial derivative would ultimately end up being 3 So notice the reason that this looks like a saddle isn't because the x and y directions disagree in fact if you take a look at Pure movement in the x direction it just looks like a constant the height of the graph along this plane along this line here is Just a constant which corresponds to the fact that the second partial derivative with respect to x is equal to 0 and then likewise if you cut It with a plane representing a constant x value meaning movement purely in the y direction The height of the graph doesn't really change along there It's constantly zero which corresponds to the fact that this other partial derivative is 0 The reason that the whole thing looks like a saddle is because when you cut it with a diagonal plane here a diagonal plane It looks like it has negative concavity, but if you were to chop it you know in another direction It would look like it has positive concavity So in fact this xy term is kind of like a way of capturing whether there's disagreement in the diagonal directions And one thing that might be surprising at first is that you only need one of these second partial derivatives in order to determine All of the information about the diagonal directions because you could imagine you know Maybe there's disagreement between movement along one certain vector and movement along another and you would have to account for infinitely many directions and look at all of them and yet evidently it's the case that You only really need to take a look at this mixed partial derivative term You know along with the original pure second partial derivatives with respect to x twice and with respect to y twice But still looking at only three different terms to take into account possible disagreement in infinitely many directions Actually feels like quite the surprise and if you want the full rigorous justification for why this is the case why? This second partial derivative test works and kind of an airtight argument I've put that in an article that you can find that kind of goes into the dirty details for those who are interested But if you just want the intuition I think it's fine to think about the fact that this mixed partial derivative is telling you how much your function Looks like the graph of f of x y equals x times y which is the graph that kind of captures all of the Diagonal disagreement and then when you let that term that mixed partial derivative term kind of compete with the agreement between the x and y Directions, you know if they agree very strongly you have to subtract off a very strong amount in order to pull it back to being negative So this this battle back and forth if it's pulled to be very negative That'll give you a saddle point if it doesn't pull hard enough then the agreement between the x and y directions wins out And it's it's either a local maximum or a local minimum So hopefully that sheds a little bit of light on why this term makes sense and why it's a reasonable way to combine the three Different parts second partial derivatives available to you and again if you want the full details I've written that up in an article form. I'll see you next video
