The continuous function f is defined on the interval negative four is less than or equal to x is less than or equal to three. The graph of f consists of two quarter circles and one line segment. So this right here is one quarter circle, then we have another quarter circle, and then it has this line segment over here. As shown in the figure above, I put the figure on the side so that we have some screen real estate down here. Let g of x be equal to two x plus the definite integral from zero to x of f of t dt. All right, that's a little bit interesting. Now let's do part a. Part a, find g of negative three. So we want to find g of negative three. So first of all, they tell us what g of x is. So g of negative three, every time we see an x, we just put a negative three there. So it's going to be two times negative three, two times negative three, plus the definite integral from zero to negative three, f of t, f of t dt. So this first part is pretty straightforward. Two times negative three is negative six. And then this part right over here is the definite integral from zero to negative three of f of t dt. So from zero to negative three, f of t dt. So this is essentially the area under f of t, or under f of x if you want to view it that way, from zero to three. And this is pretty straightforward to figure out, but we have to be careful here. Because this area, this area right over here, this would be the integral, let me do this in a color that you can see, that area right over there would be the integral from negative three to zero, f of t, or we could either say f of t dt or f of x dx, either way, dt. That would be this area right over here. They've swapped it. They have the larger number as the lower bound. They have zero as the lower bound. So what we could do this, we could rewrite this. This is the same thing. This is equal to negative six minus, if you swap the bounds of integration, you've swapped the sign on the integral. So we could say minus from negative three to zero of f of t dt. And now this thing right over here, this expression right over here, is the area, it is the area under this quarter circle. And the area under this quarter circle, we can just use a little bit of geometry to figure that out. We know it's radius. The radius here is three. Radius is equal to three. The entire circle is pi r squared. So the entire circle, the area, if this was an entire circle right over here, if this was an entire circle, that area would be pi r squared, so pi times three squared. So nine pi. So it would be nine pi. But this is only 1 fourth of the entire circle. So we want to divide it by four. So this right over here will evaluate to nine pi over four. So part a, we get, it's equal to negative six, that's that right over there, minus nine pi, minus nine pi over four. And that's at least the first part of part a. Then they say find g prime of x. So let's find g prime of x. So g prime of x. We did the first part of part a right over there. Then we need to find g prime of x. G prime of x. Well it's just going to be the derivative of g of x. The derivative of two x is just going to be two. And then the derivative, and this is the fundamental theorem of calculus right over here, the derivative of the definite integral from zero to x of f of t dt, that's just going to be f of x. That is just going to be f of x. So that is g prime of x. We did this second part right over there. That is g prime of x. And then we need to evaluate it at negative three. So g prime of negative three. G prime of negative three is going to be equal to two plus f of negative three, which is equal to two plus, and let's look at our, let's see what f of negative three is. This is our function definition. When x is equal to negative three, our function is at zero. So f of negative three is just zero. So it's just two plus zero, which is equal to two. So g of negative three is equal to two. And we're done with part a. And the trickiest part of this is just realizing the bounds of integration. That you might be tempted to say, oh, the integral between zero and negative three, that's just this area over here, because we're going between zero and negative three. But you've got to realize that we actually have to swap them and make them negative if you really want to consider this area right over here. That this integral is going to be the negative of this area. And that's what we did when we went to this step right over there.
