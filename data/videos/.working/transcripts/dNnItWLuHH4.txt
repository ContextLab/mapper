Fill in the table with whole numbers to write 0.25 in different ways. So one way to look at it is just this 2 in 0.25 is in the tenths place, so it literally represents two tenths, while the 5 is in the hundredths place, so it literally represents five hundredths. So that's one way to represent it. But then we can start to rearrange value amongst these two place values. For example, what happens if we only have one tenth, then how many hundredths would we have to have? Well, one tenth is ten hundredths. So if we take the ten hundredths that we took away from here and give it to the hundredths place, you're going to have fifteen hundredths. And you could verify that one tenth plus fifteen hundredths is equal to twenty-five hundredths. Or another way you could say it is ten hundredths plus fifteen hundredths is equal to twenty-five hundredths. Now another way you could do it, you could have no tenths and view it as all hundredths, as all hundredths, because two tenths is the same thing as twenty hundredths. So twenty hundredths plus five hundredths is twenty-five hundredths. Let's do a few more of these. These are a lot of fun. Fill in the table with whole numbers to write 20.1 in different ways. So here the table, the two columns are tens and tenths. So I guess the assumption is we're not going to give anything to the ones place here. And in the original example, we didn't have anything in the ones place either. So we could write the two in the tenths place is literally two tenths. And the one in the tenths place is literally one tenth. But let's think about what happens as we regroup value from the tenths place to the tenths place. So if we only have one tenth, then we have another tenth to play with that we have to express in terms of tenths. So ten is, well it's clearly that one tenth is the same thing as ten ones, which is the same thing as one hundred tenths. So we're essentially giving a hundred tenths. Notice we have an extra ten to play with, ten of value. That is the same thing as a hundred, hundred over ten, or a hundred tenths. And we already had one tenths. So a hundred tenths plus one tenth is going to be a hundred and one tenths. And it was really confusing. We have tens and tenths. So now let's go again. What happens if we take all the value in the tenths place? So now we have two tenths, or twenty to play with. Well twenty is how many tenths? Well you have ten tenths per one. So twenty is two hundred tenths. And so you take the two hundred tenths that you took out of the tenths place, add it to the one tenth, and you have two hundred and one tenths. Let's do one more example. So let's write two point one in three different ways. So here's between the one and the tenths place. So we could write it as two ones and one tenth. We could also write it as one one, and now we've seen this game before. We have one extra one to play with. So that's going to be ten tenths plus the one tenth that was already there. Give us eleven tenths. Or if we have no ones, well two point one is the same thing as twenty one tenths. The two represents literally twenty tenths, and then you have the one tenth. So twenty tenths plus one tenth is twenty one tenths.
