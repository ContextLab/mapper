So with that, just a quick reminder of your Khan Academy team. You've got Chelsea, that is your partnership manager. You've got Francis and Victoria. They are busy supporting your administrators in a concurrent learning session right now. We've got Cheryl on the rostering team and Jennifer and myself are the professional learning specialists to support the test coast as well as all of your districts. So we're so excited to have you here. If you have questions as we go through today, please feel free to add those questions to the chat. I'll definitely make time to answer them as we go. Okay. So a couple of things. First, our agenda, we are right in the midst of our welcome and introductions. We are going to be deep diving into our Khanmigo teacher tools. We will have some time and interactive time for you to get a chance to experience what Khanmigo has to offer to maybe plan something that you can take and use with your students tomorrow. We will spend some time sharing out about your learnings and then also cover our student embedded supports within Khan Academy and Khanmigo. And so with that, and if everyone could make sure that they are muted just as we are talking today. Okay. And so we are going to go ahead and start off with a question. I'm going to put it on my screen. When you are ready, I would love to have you add your answer into the chat. So if you could effortlessly enhance your teaching with Khanmigo, which would have the biggest impact on your teaching? You've got four choices. You don't have to choose just one. You might decide that there's maybe two or three that work for you here. Okay. I'm seeing A's and B's mostly. C and D, B and D. Okay. Okay. Lots of A's. Hooking students with activities tied to interest and their lives. Love that. Okay. So basically we've got every option. Every one of these items are something that you are excited to bring to your students and hoping to have Khanmigo help with. And that's something we'll talk about today in the ways in which you can use Khanmigo to do all of these things. And so with that, let's dive in. So I would love for us to start with our teacher tools. If you have a Khan Academy account already, definitely recommend that you go ahead and jump in there and you are going to your Khanmigo teacher tools. If you were here the previous, about two weeks ago, Jennifer did a nice job of overviewing some of those tools with you. I am going to take you in there again. If you have not created a Khan Academy account or if you don't have a Khan Academy account, you can always set one up. It is free to join and you will have those Khanmigo teacher tools available for you there. And so Khanacademy.org. And we are going to our Khanmigo teacher tools. I'm going to go live into the platform in just a second, help you navigate there. Thank you, Jennifer, for adding that into the chat. All right. Once you are in the dashboard, you've got Khanmigo and under the dropdown here at the top, teacher tools. You've got Khanmigo tools under where it says welcome. Both of those will take you to our 27 exciting and colorful teacher tools that support you with building customized, differentiated lesson supports for your students. I believe Jennifer took you through last time some of the different tools that exist. You do have tools that are coded in the light purple color for planning, instructional planning materials. You have tools coded in a light green color. Those are great for creation of educational materials and supports. You've got tools that are coded the light salmon colored. Those are great for differentiation of materials. And we've got our support and learn tools in blue and yellow. The tools that I want us to jump into today as we think about how do we craft and create materials that are going to support all the learners in our classroom, we are going to deep dive into three of them to start. And then I'm going to give you time to explore and to see how these tools can help you craft the materials that you can use with your students. So we are going to go through three. And I'm just going to quickly tell you what those three are. And then we'll deep dive a little bit, show you the power of conmigo. And then I will give you time to explore. So we've got our discussion prompts. This is a great tool for engaging and create crafting engaging prompts to stimulate those meaningful discussions in your classrooms. I highly encourage you to try this with maybe math as a subject and thinking about engaging your students in math discourse. We've got clear directions to generate concise, easy to follow instructions for assignments and activities. And in our differentiate section, which is my personal favorite as someone who was an elementary school teacher, this would have changed my life. Our chunking text tool is a great tool for breaking complex texts into manageable pieces. So we are going to focus on those tools. And something that I want you to really consider as we go through that you will see me do is that you have the ability to craft and co-create with conmigo. You are the expert, you are the driving force. Conmigo is another tool in your toolbox to help you save time as you are creating materials and components that you can use with your students in your classroom. And I want to show you some of the ways that you can modify and differentiate materials that you can bring to your students. So with that, I'm going to go on back. And we are going to, I'm going to bypass the discussion prompts because I want to give you a chance to explore there. Let's start with clear directions, actually. I'm going to go live into the platform for this. Clear directions is under my create area of my dashboard. Thank you, Jennifer, for adding the additional details for anyone who's still logging in to the Khan Academy dashboard. And I'm going to go ahead and choose clear directions. And you might be thinking, this is pretty simple. Making directions for something, maybe it's not that tough. But sometimes crafting directions takes time. And sometimes you've got a project in mind and you're thinking, okay, I need something step by step that my students can do. And we know that we don't want our students to get stuck in just understanding the directions. We want them to dive right into the task. So clear directions can be a great tool to start off with. So I'm going to click on into that. And you will notice that as a teacher, I've only got two items to fill in. I don't have to spend a lot of time here. I can select my grade level. I'm going to say, let's say I was sixth grade. And I'm going to choose my assignment. I can give a pretty overall idea of what I want this assignment to be, the description of the assignment or an activity. I'm going to put in an example here right now. Let's say I want my students to create a diagram of the water cycle. I want them to include a real world example of what does this look like. And I can just start there. I'll press start. Okay, conmigo goes to work. I've got some of my steps. Here it is. Research the water cycle. Here's my main stages of the water cycle. Include a diagram, write a paragraph, review your work. Perfect. Love it. But I know my students best. I know that I need some additional supports for my students. I know that I've got English language learners in my class. I need to do a little bit more refining in this particular tool. I can, as a teacher, hover next to areas that I might want to have conmigo make changes to. See that little purple bar on my screen? I can click that and bring up the editing toolbar. I can ask conmigo to make changes to this, try something different. I can ask conmigo to discuss this and I can really deep dive. I'm going to go ahead and change the I'm going to go ahead and just start with deep diving in with discussing it with conmigo. And you see conmigo on the far right corner, a little cute googly eyes. That's conmigo. I'm going to click on me go and just bring conmigo out. And conmigo says, okay, I've written a draft of the assignment directions. Let me know if you have any questions. I'm thinking about my students and I want to make this work for all the learners in my classroom. So maybe I can ask conmigo to provide support ideas for students with different learning modalities. Let's say that I want to do that. And conmigo is going to go to work. Here we go. I've got some ideas of things that I can include or consider as I'm thinking about these just clear directions. Maybe I'm thinking, okay, I've got students who speak Spanish primarily, that is their first language. Can I translate and get conmigo to give me a copy of this clear directions that was created in both English and Spanish? I'll say provide the directions. Let me go. And there I go. Voila, I can go ahead and have that copy in English and Spanish. And maybe I just need some quick work done in a particular area. I'm seeing that conmigo is listing the stages of the water cycle. But I know that my students are going to need some support with remembering what are those stages of the water cycle. So I can go ahead and I can ask conmigo to maybe define the key vocabulary and add that into my directions. And it's going to conmigo. Oh, and I've also got it in Spanish. There we go. I've got my key vocabulary. I can copy that over if I want. I can go ahead and just copy it and I can go ahead and drop it in. I'll just paste it directly in there. But I can go ahead and craft this the way that I needed to work for my students. Okay. So that was clear directions. Don't forget, and I shouldn't have gone away from that. I can always go back to my documents. Teachers, you always have the ability to whatever you created with conmigo, the great work of art that you created, you can go back and you can access that again. If you've clicked away, maybe the bell rang and you're like, Oh, I need to go. You can come back. You can share, you can print, and you can export that information. I can do the same with my next tool that I'm going to have you explore in just a second. Oops, let me go back, which is our chunk text tool. So with my chunk text tool, this is one of my favorites. I can take a text that I've had that I have digitally, and I can copy and paste it here into my tool. I've created one earlier with conmigo's help with one of our other teacher tools, our informational text on the American Revolution. It was causes of the American Revolution. I'm just going to grab that text about 300 words, paste it right in. Takes me just a minute. You can see the text here. Then I have the option to ask conmigo to chunk that text for comprehension or chunk a shorter text by fluency by phrases for fluency. I'll choose comprehension. And conmigo goes to work. Here's my chunk text. Let me show you my original text that I was working with. Here's my original text that I asked conmigo to create for me on the causes of the American Revolution. You can see the various paragraphs here. Here's my chunked version by central ideas, by central topics reduced for those students that that needed. Okay, so now I'm going to give you the chance to try out these tools yourself. You are going to take a few minutes to go in and give these tools a try. We also are providing some suggestions for some additional tools that you can jump into right in your teacher tools, like lesson plan, or many of you mentioned making it relevant to students lives. Try that one. Craft it. Ask conmigo to make changes. I'm going to drop that item in for you into the chat right now. It is going to ask you to make a copy when you open up that document. And I'm going to have to reduce that time to about three minutes only because there's still so much to show you. So three minutes time to just explore here. I forgot to mention that on that second page of that document are some sample prompts that you can use to engage with conmigo, some topics that you can try out on your side. If you don't have ones already in mind. An awesome suggestion, Jennifer. Jennifer is saying that if you are struggling to think of a topic, just think of something. What are you teaching in the next week, or maybe a unit that you're going to be going into in the next couple weeks. That can be a great idea. I love that idea. Even a topic as you're thinking about state assessments. If you just joined, I am dropping in the handout that we're currently working in. As we're exploring our conmigo teacher tools. One more minute of time exploring again, you'll have this handout. You can always take a little extra time yourself later. All right. All right. I know that that was not near enough time, but I hope that you got a chance to just dabble and just see what are the possibilities here. So my question to you, after your just quick exploration so far, what you saw me do, is there a tool that sticks out to you already that you're like, hey, I'm excited to try this. I want to give this a go and see how this can transform my teaching or just simply save me a couple hours in my week. And are there some creative ways that you envision incorporating these into your classroom? Feel free to add that to the chat. Or even, is there a tool that you're like, hmm, I haven't had a chance to really try it much, but this sounds interesting to me and I'd like to check it out. So that chunking text resource, Bethany, love it. Discussion prompts is one of my favorites. I mentioned especially for math because we're working on that math talk in this course. Make it relevant. Wonderful. Okay, well, I'm excited for you to deep dive further into those tools to think about how you can bring them into your classroom, how you can use them to support the learning of all your students within your classroom. As we talk and just honestly finish up our conversation, because guess what? We have a short period of time together. A couple of things I want to remind you on the student side of things. There are embedded supports for students as they are working within the platform. You might be familiar with our Khan Academy courses. We have offerings that pretty much for everyone. And so students can dive into our math courses. We have reading and language arts, arts and humanities, a whole list of different course offerings that are available for our learners. A reminder that Khan Academy is available in over 50 languages. And so it is possible for learners to come into the platform, go to the settings in their dashboard and choose the language that they'd like to work within. There are over 50 languages to choose from. Conmigo is that extra layer of support. It's that extra addition within our platform. And if you are within a district that has partnered with us and has added on Conmigo for students, now your students have an extra layer of support. And so as I talk and finish up with this last piece talking about how Conmigo can support all of our students, I am going to dive into this piece just a little further. And again, this is that extra layer if you've included this in the as a paid portion of your platform. So Conmigo is available for students. We like to say Conmigo exists for students in companion mode when students are working within the content, our Khan Academy courses and content. And Conmigo delivers real time support and tailored scaffolding for students as they're working on those essential skills. And so students will see the ability for Conmigo to be available for them as they are working in exercises and articles and videos. I'll go in and do a quick review of I'll go in in just a second and show you that component. We also support usage with Conmigo in different languages. And so Conmigo is designed with multilingual capabilities and can function in many different languages. However, we make sure that those interactions are quality interactions. And so we officially support English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi. When students are working with Conmigo, some of the accessibility features that are available for them is they have a math palette and they're working on math problems. You'll see on the right corner of my screen, they also have text to speech and speech to text available. So if they're not able to do the typing, or that's not something that they feel comfortable with, they can always put on those headphones, hear Conmigo respond back to them. And something that's pretty fabulous is that the text to speech function is also available in those different languages. So students have the ability to choose and to put Conmigo in a different language as needed. And also Conmigo can have a different voice. There are three different options for Conmigo's voice. And what that looks like, I'm going to go back into my dashboard, is a student. I'm going to go into my courses up here at the top. And let's say as a student, I am working in eighth grade math. Here are all of my units that exist for this particular course. But maybe my teacher has assigned me a practice exercise of working in negative exponents as an example. I'm getting started, I'm ready to practice and I'm going, ooh, select the equivalent expression. I need help. Conmigo, can you help me? Here's Conmigo, bottom of my screen. I can open out Conmigo as a student. And now I've got Conmigo functioning as a tutor, supporting me and giving me some options to help me dive in. I can ask Conmigo to help me solve this, try a similar example, say why should I care about learning this. I can go ahead and type away. I'll say help me solve this, Conmigo. Okay, it's asking me a question, providing me some support as I dive in. I can say, I don't know. And I could have changed the language for Conmigo. Let me just go ahead. Let's say I want Conmigo to respond to me. Oops, didn't mean to click that in Spanish. I needed to click Conmigo voice. Here we go. Let's try again. Un exponente negativo indica que de besto mar el reci proco de la vase. Como cre es que podrias escribir y a la menos dos usando esta idea? All right, and so there you have it. Conmigo is responding to me in the language that I selected. So this is one of the ways that students can get support with Conmigo as they're working through those skills. Okay, so let's talk next steps because we are quickly coming to the end of our time. I hope that you enjoyed getting to explore Conmigo Teacher Tools and thinking about how Conmigo and Khan Academy can support all the learners within your classroom. As we're coming up to our next session on the 24th, we will be talking about supporting summer learning. And again, in May, support celebrating student success. We are so thankful that you got a chance to join us for today and we look forward to seeing you again. I will close out with our quote from our CEO and founder, Sal Khan. This is our launch. And thank you so much for joining today. We hope to see you next time. Thank you.
