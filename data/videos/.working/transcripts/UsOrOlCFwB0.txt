Today I will show you how to use the Skills Overview Report in the teacher dashboard on Khan Academy. Once you have logged into Khan Academy, go to your teacher dashboard. Once you are in your teacher dashboard on the left-hand panel under Tools, click Activity Overview. This will be the screen that will load. At the top, there are two tabs, Activity and Skills. Today we are going to use the Skills tab. Once the Skills tab loads, you will have several options on the top of the screen. You can choose the grade that you want to look at, the units that you want to look at, the mastery levels, and there's an additional box that you can check if you just want to see Assigned Skills. So as I scroll down, I see that there are 11 units and 148 skills. I'm just going to look at the ratios unit. So if I click ratios, this will expand the screen and I will be able to see more information. So this is Basic Ratios, one of the skills. Here's the Common Core Standard, and here is actually the exercise. I can look at the actual exercise that the students have completed. Under that, you will see the mastery levels. If I hover over the mastery levels, it will explain to me exactly what the student had to complete in order to earn this mastery level. I can also assign this assignment back to the students right from this screen. So if I click this blue, assign this skill button, a pop-up screen will appear and it will allow me to pick my question set, whether I want to have a different question set or the same question set. It would allow me to select or deselect students that I want to have this assignment. I can choose the start date, the start time, the due date, and the due time, and then I just click the assign button. It will bring me back to this screen. This is a great snapshot for you to be able to see what level students are at for different skill levels and to make small groups and differentiate within your classroom. You can also take this data back to PLCs and revise your teaching instruction in order to suit the needs of the different students in the different skill sets. Another thing you can do with this report is click on the individual student. If I click on Victoria, I will see just her information. At the top, make sure everything that you want to see is clicked. So I'm going to look at just the ratio. So I'm going to unselect everything and just select ratios. And here I can see that she has 148 skills. She's practiced 13. Here is the mastery levels that she's earned. And if I dig a little bit deeper, I can see that these are the things that were assigned to Victoria. Here are her current mastery levels, and I can actually look at the different assignments that were assigned to her. This is a great tool for parent-teacher conferences or IEP meetings or for individual student conferences. Now we'll go back to the main class page where I see all my students. And I can go down to the next skill level, and I can see the same exact information, what students are performing where, and I can also assign the skill, see the Common Core strand, and also look at the assignment.
