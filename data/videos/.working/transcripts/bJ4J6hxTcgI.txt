I've been talking to some coworkers recently, and I realized that they didn't realize what I thought was fairly public knowledge. So I've decided to make a video on it. And this really is just the fact that Hank Paulson, when he became Treasury Secretary, actually got a pretty good deal, actually. Even when it happened, I wondered, why would the CEO of Goldman Sachs join an administration that had a traditionally weak Treasury Secretary and join it for the last year of the administration? And this is an article from a Wall Street Journal market watch dated June 30, 2006. I don't know how much you can see it. I know the text quality definitely degrades when it goes to YouTube. But it's pretty much just saying that when you become Treasury Secretary, to avoid a conflict of interest, you quote unquote, have to sell your shares. Because you essentially don't want to be Treasury Secretary and also own a large stake in a company. We can just read this together. Paulson filed to sell 3.23 million shares in a shelf offering of Goldman Sachs. Stock according to prospectus filed with regulators. Based on the bank's closing price of $152, the stock is worth about $492 million. So he's sold $500 million. So there's one, I guess, benefit of becoming the Treasury Secretary is that you can offload your stock. And it won't raise any questions. Because normally, if you're the CEO of a company and you were to just offload all of your stock, if you were to offload $500 million onto the market, people would view that as a huge red flag on the company. And the stock would just trade down and you would get less value for it. It would just be bad for investors in general. But if you say, hey, I'm going to become the Treasury Secretary, I have to sell these shares, then all of a sudden it doesn't look as bad. But the real, I guess, benefit to what he got is this rule. And let me take it down, go down here. See, it goes here, right here. Interestingly, under US government ethics rules, while Paulson is required to sell the shares, he is also exempt from paying taxes on any capital gains on the sale if he obtains a certificate of divestiture. The rule granting the exception is designed to make sure prospective government employees who own a lot of stock are not dissuaded from joining the government. Earlier this week, The Economist magazine estimated the rule eliminated a tax liability of about $200 million for Paulson. And just to be clear, and I'm not an expert on the tax code here, it allows him, so it does. It eliminated this liability. If I was the CEO of a company and if I wasn't Treasury Secretary and if I sold all my shares, because no one wants their entire net worth to be sitting in the stock of one company, as we now learned, even Goldman Sachs shares dropped a lot, you want to diversify your holdings. So if I'm a CEO and I want to retire and I want to diversify my holdings into other things, I'm going to have to pay, if I sell $500 million of stock that has a very low cost basis, I essentially paid nothing for it, I'm going to have to pay $200 million. But if I become Treasury Secretary for essentially, what, June 2006 until, what, January 2008? So essentially for 18 months work, I can avoid a $200 million, or at least I can defer. Well, just by diversifying, I avoid the $200 million tax penalty, and then it actually does get deferred. So let's say he takes that $500 million and he sells all his Goldman shares and he puts it into Treasuries. 10 years into the future, when he sells those Treasuries, my understanding is he will have to still pay the capital gains tax. But what's interesting about that is a tax deferral really is a savings, because I could either pay $200 million now, that's what would happen to anyone else who isn't becoming Treasury Secretary, or I can defer the taxes, let's say you defer it 10 years into the future. So you pay 200 in 10 years, and you could probably defer it more, I mean this is going to go into his estate, this is enough money that many generations of Paulsons can live very happily without contributing much to the world. But in 10 years, if he decides to sell whatever he diversifies into, and even then if he has to pay $200 million at that point, the present value of that $200 million, depending on what you discounted at, if you discounted it at 6% or 7%, which I think is a reasonable rate, considering what he probably could get in other investments, but you might want to discount it by something less. But the present value of that is really something on the order of about $100 million. So no matter how you look at it, for about 18 months of work, Paulson essentially got to defer a $200 million tax liability, or you could almost, and even if you say well it's just a deferral and he's going to have to pay it eventually, the present value savings of that is at least $100 million. So just by becoming Treasury Secretary for 18 months, he almost got paid more than any one of his, I believe it was seven or eight years, at Goldman Sachs. And then a kind of a more conspiratorial view on why he decided to do this, as if the $100 million or the $200 million, depending on how you view it, wasn't enough, or even just the ability to diversify your holdings without creating a big red flag, is that he was CEO of Goldman Sachs from 1999, or it says it right here, he was the CEO of Goldman Sachs in May 1999. He only made $35 million a year, which we all know is peanuts relative to at least his actual holdings in the stock, but this is a little bit of a ridiculous number too. I'd be CEO of Goldman Sachs for $30 million. But anyway, so if you wanted to be a little bit more sinister about his motivations, then you could also say that he was CEO from 1999 until 2006, which is exactly the time period where a lot of the mess that we're trying to unwind right now was essentially created. And Goldman Sachs was a very central figure in a lot of this, and if you are the Treasury Secretary, it allows you a unique position to create some of these bailouts so that you can essentially cover up a lot of the damage that was done by you and your fellow executives over this seven-year period. Anyway, I just wanted to point this out. I thought it was common knowledge, but I realize it's not because I know financial professionals, my co-workers, who didn't know about this. And I think it's an important thing to realize, especially considering the power he has had in the last 18 months. Not only did he have that power, which allowed him to essentially cover up, well, maybe, depending on what you view as motivations, but he also got compensated quite nicely for his efforts.
