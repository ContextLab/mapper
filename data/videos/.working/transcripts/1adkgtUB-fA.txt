A school secretary started the school year with 450 markers at open house, I should say, at the open house. At the open house, parents donated 163 markers. By winter break, 278 markers had been dried out or lost. How many usable markers does the school have now? Pause this video and try to think through that before we do this together. All right, let's first try to visualize this with a strip diagram. So we start the school year with 450 markers. So let's say that this is, and I'm just eyeballing it, so it's not going to be exact, but just to help visualize. So let's say that this is 450 right over here. So that's the number of markers that we start with. And at the open house, parents donated 163. So that's going to increase the number of markers we have. So let me do this in another color. So they donated 163 markers. So we should increase by 163. So it looks something like this. We should increase by another 163. And then by winter break, 278 markers had been dried out or lost. So this is now taking away from our total number of markers. 278 had been dried out or lost. So we could take those away, the 278. Maybe it looks something like this, 278. And so this piece right over here is what is going to be left over. So we need to figure out this thing that I'm shading in, I guess you could say black. So first we could add 450 to 163 to get this total, and then we could subtract 278. So we're going to do 450 plus 163, plus 163. And then we're going to subtract 278. So first 450 plus 163, I can expand those out. That's the same thing. I'll do it, let's see, I think I have space here. 400, I have 400s plus five 10s, that's 50, plus zero ones. And then I'm adding 163, that's 100, six 10s, and three ones. And if I add those two together, maybe in purple, I'm going to get three ones. I am getting 50 plus 60, that's 110 or 11 10s. Five plus six is 11, but we're in the 10s place. So this is 11 10s or 110, and then 400 plus 100 is 500. So 500 plus 110, this part over here is 610, plus three, which is equal to 613. So this entire thing right over here, this whole thing is 613, and now we want to subtract 278 from that. Well, we could use a similar technique. We could expand out, 613 is 600s plus 110, plus three ones. And we're going to subtract out 200s, seven 10s, and eight ones. So minus 200, subtracting seven 10s and subtracting eight ones. Now, when we do this, we can't subtract three from eight from three, so let's take 10 from the 10s place. So this becomes zero. We put the 10 here, this becomes 13. 13 minus eight is five. Now we have a problem in the 10s place. We have no 10s, and we want to subtract 70. So let's take 100 from the 100s place. So if we take 100, this becomes 500, and we put that 100 over here, this becomes 100, and again, 100 minus 70 is 30, and then I have 500 minus 200 is 300. So 300 plus 30 plus five, which is 335. 300s, three 10s, and five ones. So that's how many usable markers the school now has, 335.
