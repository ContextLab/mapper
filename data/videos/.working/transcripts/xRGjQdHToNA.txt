Hello grammarians. Hello David. Hello Paige. So today we're going to talk about apostrophes and plurals and We talked about this a little bit in our introduction to the apostrophe video This is a very very rare case where we use an apostrophe To show that something is plural and it almost never happens But we will explain when it does. Paige when is the one time in this immense and wonderful galaxy of English when the stars align for it to be permissible to Pluralize something with an apostrophe that one time is when you are pluralizing a lowercase letter So if you're saying something like you need to remember to always dot your eyes Where you're talking about the letter I and there are several of them You're gonna put an apostrophe before the s. Okay, and that's to prevent it from looking like is right? Cuz if we didn't have that apostrophe in there, it would just like be the word is there's no way to tell eyes From the word is in that case, right and you need to remember to always die your is doesn't make any sense, right? so Right. So this apostrophe can look like it's making the letter I possessive But it's really just there to make it clear that this is plural I and not is is So this is the only case If it were uppercase letters, you wouldn't do this, right? So if you were saying, you know David's capital A's look like trees It's less likely that you're going to confuse capital a lowercase s in the middle of a sentence for the word as Right because you wouldn't just capitalize the word as in the middle of a sentence, right? So this is for only lowercase letters. So the little ones the inside voice. I Mean but that's like page that's it right? Like that's the only exception That's the only time to use apostrophes to form the plural no other time so if you're talking about doesn't matter if you're talking about like CDs or DVDs or MP threes or whatever you kids are listening to these days like it doesn't it doesn't matter There's no need for an apostrophe in any of these places Right because that's pretty clear you just use a lowercase s But if you're trying to talk about multiple lowercase letters, then you use an apostrophe Yeah, so if you're trying to figure out how to make something plural and you're like, do I use an apostrophe? No, unless it's a lowercase letter You can learn anything David out page out
