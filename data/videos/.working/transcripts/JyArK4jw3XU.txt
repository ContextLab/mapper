We've already seen, and you're probably getting tired of me pointing it out repeatedly, that this yellow area right over here, this area under the curve y is equal to f of x and above the positive x-axis, or I guess I could say just above the x-axis, between the point between x equals a and x equals b, that we can denote this area right over here as a definite integral from a to b of f of x dx. Now what I want to explore in this video, and it'll come up with kind of an answer that you probably could have guessed on your own, but at least get an intuition for it, is I want to start thinking about the area under the curve that's a scaled version of f of x. Let's say it's y is equal to c times f of x. y is equal to some number times f of x, so it's scaling f of x. And so I want this to be kind of some arbitrary number, but just to help me visualize, you know, I have to draw something. So I'm just gonna kind of, in my head, let's just pretend like the c is three, just for visualization purposes. So it's gonna be three times the song, instead of this far right over here, it's gonna be about this far, far right over here. Instead of this far right over here, it's gonna be that and another right over there. And then instead of, it's gonna be about there, and then instead of it being like that, it's going to be one, two, and then three right around there. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what this curve is going to look like. It's going to be a scaled version of f of x, at least what I'm drawing is pretty close to three times f of x, but just to give you an idea, it's gonna look something like, and over here, let's see, at this distance, do a second one, a third one, it's gonna be up here. It's gonna look something, something like this. It's gonna look something like that. So this is a scaled version. And the scale I did right here, I assumed a positive c greater than zero, but this is just for visualization purposes. Now, what do we think the area under this curve is going to be between a and b? So what do we think this, what do we think, what do we think this area, this area, right over here is going to be? And we already know how we can denote it. That area right over there is equal to the definite integral from a to b of the function we're integrating is c f of x dx. I guess to make the question a little bit clearer, how does this relate to this? How does this green area relate to this yellow area? Well, one way to think about it is we just scaled the vertical dimension up by c. So one way that you could reason it is, well, if I'm finding the area of something, if I have the area of a rectangle, and I have the vertical dimension is, let's say the vertical dimension is, I don't want to use those same letters over and over again. Well, I'll just, well, say the vertical dimension is alpha and the horizontal dimension is beta. We know that the area, we know that the area is going to be alpha times beta. Now, if I scale up the vertical dimension by c, so instead of alpha, this is c times alpha, and this is the width is beta. If I scale up the vertical dimension by c, so this is essentially, this is now c times alpha, what's the area going to be? Well, it's going to be c alpha times beta. Or another way to think of it, I have just taken, when I scale one of the dimensions by c, I take my old area and I scale up my old area by c. And that's what we're doing, we're scaling up the vertical dimension by c. When you multiply c times f of x, f of x is giving us the vertical height. Now, obviously that changes as our x changes, but when you think back to the Riemann sums, the f of x is what gave us the height of our rectangles. We're now scaling up the height, or scaling, I should say, because we might be scaling down depending on the c. We're scaling it, we're scaling one dimension by c. If you scale one dimension by c, you're going to scale the area by c. So this right over here, the integral, let me just rewrite it, the integral from a to b of c f of x dx, that's just going to be the scaled, we're just going to take the area of f of x, so let me do that in that same color. We're going to take the area under the curve f of x from a to b f of x dx, and we're just going to scale it up, we're going to scale it up by this c. We're just going to scale it up by the c. So you might say, okay, maybe I could have felt that that was, you know, if there was a c inside of the integral, now I can take the c out of the integral. Once again, this is not a rigorous proof based on the definition of the definite integral, but it hopefully gives you a little bit of intuition why you can do this. If you scale up the function, you're essentially scaling up the vertical dimension, so the area under this is going to just be a scaled up version of the area under the original function f of x. And once again, really, really, really useful property, really, really useful property of definite integrals that's going to help us solve a bunch of definite integrals and kind of clarify what we're even doing with them.
