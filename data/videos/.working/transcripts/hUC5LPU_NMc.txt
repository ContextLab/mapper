This is Sal with Jeffrey Morgan. What are we going to do now? This is an unfamiliar environment for me. What's going on here? What is this? So we're in a word processor because we're going to talk about words. Word processor. Fascinating. What word processor are we in, by the way? This is Google Docs, Google Drive, I think it's now called. Everyone could use this if they were Google Docs. All right. So if you're going to write, you're going to actually write on a keyboard. So we thought, okay, let's get out of this handwritten stuff and let's get into a real keyboarding world. So I thought today we're going to talk about nouns. All right. So nouns, I remember that. So nouns is actually a grammatical term. The really key idea behind nouns is naming things. Dramatical, like subject, predicate, all these crazy things that you remember from baseball. Exactly. Adverbs, adverbs, conjunctions. But nouns are about naming things. You're taking a strong stand against my entire education. Yes. And actually naming a noun in a more understandable way by calling it something that names things. Exactly. The power of a noun is, so why would I need a new noun? So if I had the word dog, why do I need the word cat? And the answer is because cats don't come when you call. Dogs do. Right. There's a difference between... So now I need the words dog and cat. So do I need the word cocker spaniel? Well, maybe not. If I'm just a dog owner, but if I'm a pet store owner, I need the word cocker spaniel. I'm not typing cocker spaniel because actually I have a couple of spell... Cocker... Cocker spaniel. Sort of like Spanish only with an L. Yeah, yeah. Spaniel part is the easy part. I thought maybe cocker had an H in there or something. You're doing good. Cocker spaniel. Is it capitalized? Yeah, you did good. We haven't gotten to that yet. But you're getting hung up on grammar, which everybody does. I shouldn't have capitalized dog and cat though. So, okay. But you're... I'm getting hung up on grammar. You are getting hung up on grammar. Because I want to be a member of the ruling class. Exactly. Or at least look like I am. But this is how people can put roadblocks in their writing because they worry about grammar before they worry about logic. I want to talk about the logic, which is why do people care about a cocker spaniel? Well, a pet store guy does because you might know... People come in and they specifically want to buy a breed of dog. And cocker spaniel has certain attributes. It gives you precision. It gives you precision. It does. And what you notice about people is when they have an area of expertise, they have lots and lots and lots of precise nouns in that area. Sometimes they call it jargon. Yes. Okay. So jargon is just a bunch of nouns for specialists. And jargon itself is a noun. Look at that. There it is. It all comes back. No. And what's interesting about that... So look at the word jargon. Why do you need the word jargon? Because it gives you power over the world. It lets you identify a class of language and say, you know what? That language I don't need to understand. Those specialists need to understand it because there are nerds in that subject, but I don't need to. Or maybe I should, but I'm also going to tell them to stop using it. Well... Because they're preventing other people from understanding. And the issue with jargon is jargon doesn't prevent specialists from understanding each other. In fact, it probably helps specialists, but it prevents generalists. Because it can get to precision faster. Exactly. Exactly. So when you hang out in Silicon Valley with all these software people and they're always using three-letter acronyms and you're going, well, what's CRM, SPT, whatever it is? It's like, okay. But they know what they're talking about. So that's all I would want to say about nouns is, look, you want to know a bunch of general nouns to sort of work your way through the world. So there's a set of vocabulary you just have to know to be a citizen. And then whatever you're passionate about, you should expect to get more and more nouns in that area because they're going to teach you the refined distinctions that make that area interesting and make you more powerful in that specialized area. What I think would be a fun way to end this is to just list a bunch of rounds. And maybe things that are not nouns. Okay. All right. So you want to just brainstorm? Let's brainstorm. Go ahead. You go first. All right. Chuck Norris is a noun. Chuck Norris. Yes, Chuck Norris is a noun. Someone argue he's maybe a verb and a noun. Well, and an adjective. But he's definitely a noun. This is a noun. And basically, what you're doing though is you're saying he's a body of forces. He is. The interesting thing about nouns is they always represent a body of forces. That's why we care about them. So water has the property of cooling and tables have the property of holding things up and cups keep waters on tables. And I mean, when your nouns help you model how the world works. And so if you don't have enough nouns, you might not know how it works. But after a while, you don't need more nouns unless you've seen some new property in the world that you're trying to name. Love. Love. Okay. So now love is an abstract. Now that's one of those ones where it's not a concrete noun. You can't hold it. It's not a person, place or thing. I mean, I guess you could call it a thing, but it's really nice. It's a relationship. But it's powerful. If you don't understand love, you have trouble when you go home at night. Irony. Okay. So irony is an interesting word. So irony is... But now who needs to know the word irony? Which I think is Alanis Morissette is an ironic, but most of our song is actually... Isn't it unfortunate? The guy who's never written on a plane and the plane goes... That's unfortunate. That wasn't so ironic. That wasn't ironic. I guess there's a little bit of irony there. Well, but there's kind of... Yeah, there's sort of... Irony at one level is two perspectives which don't link up. But irony as a concept is a special... I would argue is a specialist word. Most people probably don't need the word irony, but a literary critic could not live without it. And so again, it's what are you interested in? If you're interested in hockey, you'll get there or soccer or golf. I'll do golf because I love golf. So you need to know things about like a high fade. Well, what's a high fade? Well, it's a shot in golf or a flop shot or what's a lob wedge or that kind of stuff. And I throw swimming and golfing there because they'll sound like an action. They are. But when you talk about the action itself, you're naming the action. So swimming is good for you. I want to take swimming... Well, swimming lessons, it's modifying the word lessons. Language is a very, very... So swimming is sometimes a noun. Language is a very, very mutable thing. Words can be verbs, modifiers, nouns. And it's amazing. So when we try to teach a computer these rules, we still can't do it. But kids learn it before they're taught. Love is sometimes a noun. Yes, sometimes a noun, sometimes a verb. Exactly. And when you're talking about as a noun, it means you're talking about the force of love. When you're using as a verb, you're talking about your relationship, being in a relationship of love to another person. So verbs connect nouns to each other. So John loves Mary, right? So now we've connected... We used a verb to connect two nouns together. I'm also listening to not nouns. Not nouns. Yeah, so eat, run... Lovely. Lovely. Yeah, so basically what you're going to find with the not nouns, there's going to be three other classes, but all the action stuff, then all the modifier stuff. So lovely is a modifier. It's telling you Jane is lovely or that's a lovely day out. So these are eat and run are actions. That's right. We were to use the grammatical fancy words, verbs. Yep, yep, yep, absolutely. Lovely is a modifier. Right. If it's modifying, if it's describing a noun, it would be an adjective. That's right. If it's describing a verb, it would be an adverb. Right. See, I learned that. Those are good, but that's the grammatical idea. Yeah, I don't want to... Okay. Those are grammatical ideas. I'm going to get out of my whole ruling class in security. Well, it's a difference between semantics and syntax. Sometimes the words use... But from a meaning point of view, yeah, and you need modifiers only to the degree that you want to be more precise about what's going on in the world or you want to be more rhetorical. You want to actually create a bond with your audience by using a modifier to connect with them emotionally. Those are the two classic reasons to use. Float is a verb. It describes an attribute of ivory soap that is not an attribute of douse. I think you're dating people because I barely remember those guys. That was apparently their biggest claim to fame, is that the soap floats. It's amazing that marketers determined that people would buy soap based on the fact that it would float. It floats. Actually, they found out it floats. I think what happens, they probably did focus scripts to say, you know, the cool thing about the soap is it floats. Which to me tells me they put air in it, which means I'm getting less soap, but I don't know. See, you're going the wrong way. That's too much logic. That's too much logic and not rhetoric. They're appealing to rhetoric. Exactly. That's exactly true. So born? Okay, so again, born is an action. It's also... You can use it as a modifier. Born in Portland, Oregon. So it tells me stuff like that. He was born. That would be modified. He was. It's a state. Well, yes. It's an intransitive verb. It's a state. I mean, so this is where the grammatical categories get very confusing and very complex. I actually don't like teaching grammar until people are well into their writing world because it really doesn't help. What does help is these four ideas. Name things. That's the noun-like stuff. Talk about actions and relationships. That's the verb-like stuff. Be more precise about either one of those. That's the modifier stuff. And the fourth one we haven't talked about is words like and, but, although, when. They're called conjunctions. And that's about how do you... All right, then we're just saying not nouns. We're throwing everything into the bucket right now. So I put in and, when, you know. But when, although... Exactly. Cool ways of talking about how two ideas relate to it. Here to for, therefore, moreover. And then one thing, there's one classic grammar that people should just know about. All the prepositions in, out, above, around, whatever. It turns out that they're always used in a modifying way. So you never use in by itself. It's like the boy in the car. And in the car just tells you more precisely something about the boy. In to... Yeah, exactly. Above, around, of... No, us can act... That's actually a little... Us is a little grammatical blorp. But it's not a noun. No, it's actually a form of modifier. But it's not a noun. No, it's not a noun. Yeah, that's true. It's not a noun. That's why we're talking about nouns. Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Very cool. Well, this was fun. We should do one of these. I like these.
