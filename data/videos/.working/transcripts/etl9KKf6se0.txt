Let's get some practice solving some exponential equations and we have one right over here. We have 26 to the nine x plus five power equals one. So pause the video and see if you can tell me what x is going to be. Well the key here is to realize that 26 to the zeroth power to the zeroth power is equal to one. Anything to the zeroth power is going to be equal to one. Zero to the zeroth power, we can discuss it some other time, but anything other than zero to the zeroth power is going to be one. So we just have to say, well nine x plus five needs to be equal to zero. Nine x plus five needs to be equal to zero and this is pretty straightforward to solve. Subtract five from both sides and we get nine x is equal to negative five. Divide both sides by nine and we are left with x is equal to negative five. Let's do another one of these and let's make it a little bit more interesting. Let's say we have the exponential equation. Two to the three x plus five power is equal to 64 to the x minus seventh power. Once again, pause the video and see if you can tell me what x is going to be or what x needs to be to satisfy this exponential equation. Alright, so you might at first say, oh maybe three x plus five needs to be equal to x minus seven but that wouldn't work because these are two different bases. You have two to the three x plus five power then you have 64 to the x minus seven. The key here is to express both of these with the same base and lucky for us, 64 is a power of two. Two to the, let's see, two to the third is eight so it's gonna be two to the third times two to the third. Eight times eight is 64 so it's two to the sixth is equal to 64 and you can verify that. Take six twos and multiply them together. You're going to get 64. This is just a little bit easier for me. Eight times eight and this is the same thing as two to the sixth power is 64 and I knew it was two to the sixth power because I just added the exponents because I had the same base. Alright, so I can rewrite 64. Let me rewrite the whole thing. So this is two to the three x plus five power is equal to, instead of writing 64, I am going to write two to the sixth power, two to the sixth power and then that to the x minus seventh power. X minus seventh power. And to simplify this a little bit, we just have to remind ourselves that if I raise something to one power and then I raise that to another power, this is the same thing as raising my base to the product of these powers, a to the bc power. So this equation I can rewrite as two to the three x plus five is equal to two to the, and I just multiply six times x minus seven. So it's going to be six x, six x minus six times seven is 42. I'll just write the whole thing in yellow. So six x minus 42. I just multiply the six times the entire expression x minus seven. And so now it's interesting. I have two to the three x plus five power has to be equal to two to the six x minus 42 power. So these need to be the same exponent. So three x plus five needs to be equal to six x minus 42. So there we go. It sets up a nice little linear equation for us. Three x plus five is equal to six x minus 42. Let's see. We could get all of our, since I'll put my x's on the right-hand side since I have more x's on the right already. So let me subtract three x from both sides. And let me, I want to get rid of this 42 here. So let's add 42 to both sides. And we are going to be left with five plus 42 is 47 is equal to 47 is equal to three x. Now we just divide both sides by three and we are left with x is equal to 47 over three. X is equal to 47 over three. And we are done.
