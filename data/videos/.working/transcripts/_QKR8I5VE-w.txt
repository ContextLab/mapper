We're told that Naomi lives at Second Avenue and Third Street, representing 2,3 on the graph below. Her school is at Fourth Avenue and Tenth Street, representing 4,10 on the graph. She walks over to Fourth Avenue and up to Tenth Street. Plot her home and school on the map. How many blocks does Naomi walk to school? So let's plot her home first. Second Avenue and Third Street, which they're giving us the coordinates 2,3. So the x-axis right over here, this is representing the avenues. And then the y-axis here, the vertical axis, this represents the street. So 2,3, so this right over here, Second Avenue and Third Street. So you see here, we went to Second Avenue and then we went up to Third Street. This is where she lives at home. We could have also said Third Street and Second Avenue. Now her school is at Fourth Avenue and Tenth Street. So Fourth Avenue, and now we're going to go, so if we start at the origin, we go to Fourth Avenue and then go up 10 to Tenth Street. So this is the coordinate 4,10. So this is where her home is. This is where her school is. They say she walks over to Fourth Avenue and up to Tenth Street. So she walks from Second Avenue to Fourth Avenue and then up to Tenth Street. How many blocks does Naomi walk to school? Well, as she walks from Second Avenue to Fourth Avenue, she's going to walk two blocks. One block and two blocks. You shouldn't get confused by the, they're actually marking off with these lines every half a block. So that's one block to Third Avenue, two blocks to Fourth Avenue. So that's two blocks so far. And then she goes from Third Street to Tenth Street. Well, if you go from Third Street to Tenth Street, that's going to be seven more blocks. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So two in the horizontal direction and then seven in the vertical direction. So that's nine total blocks.
