Frank wants to fill up a spherical water balloon with as much water as possible. The balloons he bought can stretch to a radius of three inches. Not too big. If the volume of a sphere is, and this is volume as a function of radius, is equal to 4 thirds pi r cubed, what volume of water in cubic inches can Frank put into the balloon? So this function definition is going, if you give it a radius in inches, it's going to produce a volume in cubic inches. Let's rewrite it. Volume as a function of radius is equal to 4 thirds pi r cubed. Now, they say the balloons he bought can stretch to a radius of three inches. So let's think about if the radius gets to three inches, what the volume of that balloon is going to be. So we essentially would just input three inches into our function definition. So everywhere where we see an r, we would replace it with a three. So we could write, just to be clear, let me rewrite it in the same color, V of, that's not the same color. We do that brownish color right over here. So V of three, V of three is equal to 4 thirds pi, instead of r cubed, I would write three cubed. Three, 4 thirds pi, three cubed. Three cubed. This is how the function definition works. Whatever we input here, it will replace the r in the expression. So V of three is going to be equal to, so this is going to be equal to 4 thirds pi times three to the third power is 27. 27 divided by three is nine. So this is nine. Nine times four is 36 pi. So this is equal to 36 pi. And since this was in inches, our volume is going to be in inches, in inches, in inches cubed, or cubic inches. So that's the volume of water that Frank can put in the balloon. 36 pi cubic inches.
