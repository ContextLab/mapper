In the last video, we worked through essentially the probability distribution for this random variable defined as the number of free throws you make when taking six free throws, assuming you have a 70% free throw percentage. And I suggested, hey, why don't you visualize this, graph this probability distribution, this binomial probability distribution. And when I thought about it, I said, well, you know, I too would enjoy graphing it, and we might as well do it together, because whenever you graph these things, it makes it very visual, kind of the shape of a binomial distribution like this. So let's do that. So let me maybe move over to the right a little bit. I really just need to be able to keep track of these things right over here. So let me draw some lines. So let me, if I were to just draw one line there, and then another line here. And then we have the different percentages. So let's do that. See, the highest one is a little over 30%, 32%. So maybe we'll go as high as 40% here. 40%. And then this would be 20%. 20%, that looks about halfway, 20%. This would be 10%. 10%. And this would be 30%. 30%. And then in this axis, let's do the different values that the random variable could take on. So the random variable taking on the value zero. The random variable taking on the value one. Zero, one. The random variable taking on two. Two, we're almost there. Let's see, three. And then four. Four. And then five. Five. And then finally six. Taking x equals six. And then six, and now let's just graph all of these. So this first one, 0.1%, well that's barely gonna register on this graph right here, so I'll just give it a little bit of a showing right over there. Actually, I want me to do it in that green color. So let me make sure, so in that green color, you're gonna have just a little bit of a showing. One as well is kind of barely a showing, so it shows up a little bit more. So let me draw it like that. That is 1% right over there. Now two is 6%, which on this scale is gonna be about, it's about that high. So we draw it like that. So that is two. So that is 6%, right there. x equaling three, 18 1�2% shot of that happening. So 18 1�2, it gets us right about, it's a hand-drawn chart, or histogram, so you have to bear with me. So it's roughly there. And then four, four was 32.4%. So that is up here. So 32.4% is right, looks like that. So let me shade that in. 32.4%. And then five was 30.3%. So 30.3%, slightly lower, just like that. And it looks, it'll look like this. 33%. And finally, six is 11.8%. 11.8%. So really, this whole video was just an exercise in making a histogram. But it's useful, because to actually visualize, to actually visualize what the distribution looks like. And what's really interesting is to think about, well, how does this change as you change, as you change the free throw percentage, or as you change the number of shots you take, how does this change this binomial distribution? And you could do that on a spreadsheet and actually see how that all works out.
