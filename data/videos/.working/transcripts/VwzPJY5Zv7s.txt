Kevin ate one slice of pizza, and Emily ate two slices. If Kevin ate one fifth of the pizza, one fifth of the pizza, what fraction of the pizza is remaining? So let's just think about how many total pieces, because in order to figure out the fraction of the pizza that is remaining, we need to figure out the number of pieces remaining, number of remaining pieces, divided by the total number of pieces. Total number, let me write it this way, total number of slices over the total number. So number of slices remaining over total number of slices. So let's figure out the total number of slices that were there originally. They tell us Kevin ate one slice of pizza, and that is one fifth of the pizza. One slice is one fifth of the pizza. That tells us, these two pieces of information tell us, if one slice is one fifth of the pizza, that tells us that the pizza originally had five total slices. So this number right over here is five. And now, what are the number of pieces or number of slices remaining? So we started off with five total slices. Kevin ate one, so let's subtract out the one that Kevin ate. Emily ate two, so let's subtract out those two. And we're left with five minus one minus two, we're left with two slices remaining. Two remaining, two remaining slices. So this right over here is going to be two. So there's two fifths of the pizza is remaining.
