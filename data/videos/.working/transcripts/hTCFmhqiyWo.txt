All right. Hello, everyone. Welcome back or just welcome to the Northeast Learning Collaborative. This is the session three out of six. So if you I would love to know in the chat first off to say, Hey, let me know where you're zooming in from. And if this is your first session, or have you attended the other ones? The first we did on mastery learning. Second was in February around writing and today is all about math. And I'm very excited for a couple reasons. Number one, I have a special guest with me today. And number two, we change the format so we actually can see each other's faces if you want to share your camera. I feel like I wanted a little bit more engagement interactivity. So if you want to turn your camera on, great, no pressure. But we are going to go ahead and get started with the most important question today. How are you feeling on a scale of melted duck? Just go ahead and type that in the chat. Make sure that you can see the chat and whatever you type is correct. Or if you want to have your camera on, you can just show us with numbers. So we got it. We got a four almost melted. I'm a one for being on this presentation right now. But inside I'm a nine because I'm fighting a cold. Oh, we have a couple we have a couple of fours. Dina, how about you? How are you feeling on a scale of melted duck? I think I'm probably about a three. We had spring break here last week. So I'm coming off of spring break, which re-enter you back into normal life is a little tough, like feeling good, but just a little bit of a deflated duck. But excited to be here with you all today. Excellent. Well, nice to meet you. My name is Danielle Sullivan, and I am in charge of Northeast District Partnerships for Khan Academy. A little bit of background on me. I'm from Oswego, New York, and I used to teach fifth and sixth grade special education. And I was also in an improv comedy troupe. So sometimes I say some weird stuff on these webinars. I think you all have learned to enjoy my sense of humor and also spontaneity. But I'm really excited to be part of the Khan Academy team. And it's coming up on my one year anniversary of the Khan Academy. And today we're really excited to share all about math. And I'm gonna let my co host who I'm so excited that she's with me today, because she and I have actually had a long history together, working at different ed tech companies. I feel like I've just followed Dina along in our career. So I'm excited to have Dina here today, let her introduce herself. Hey, everyone, my name is Dina Nyman, as Danielle shared, we have worked together for a very long time. We love working together because we share a passion for invigorating education and being creative and thoughtful. I am the director of district success here at Khan Academy. If you partner with us, you likely know the members of my team, Sarah Thaler, Raven Cassius. I'm usually behind the scenes helping out, but very excited to get to come and hang out with you. And a couple of notes about my pictures here. I have been a math teacher forever. I like to say I'm an old math teacher. I started back in the olden days of overhead projectors, and have taught for a very long time, and have had the privilege of teaching the students like the one in the top left corner, Tommy, who made it easy to be a math teacher, the student in the bottom right corner, Ralph, who was forever a challenge, but I'm still in touch with him because he's a great kid, but kept me on my toes. And then the one in the middle has made me the best version of my teaching self. And that is my child who thinks differently than I do and pushes my skills in explaining math, talking about math, and making sure that any time we talk about it, that it's relevant. So that's a little bit about me. You'll hear a little bit more about me later on, but I'm very excited to be here with you all today. Great. Thank you, Dina. So the goal for today, and we're going to start with what's been sort of the brand of these webinars, the current state of math and what can help best practices in math based on neuroscience. And then we're going to lean into how we're thinking through math at Khan Academy and how Comigo can help. So it wouldn't be a math webinar without asking you to do a little bit of math. So I'm going to give you a minute or two to solve this equation and go ahead and put the answer in the chat. So just give you a minute or two, solve this equation. All right. We have some eager math students right there. I already put it in the chat. Anyone else? Great. We have some discourse happening. So how many of you, when I just put that on the screen, felt like this. When you solve a math's problem three times and get a different answer each time, or maybe you felt like this, or maybe you were like, I love math. Thank you. I love starting with math. What if I showed it to you this way? Would that change anything? Yeah, Dean is definitely the third one. So fun fact, this math problem was one of the ones that broke the internet. I literally googled math problems that cause fights on Facebook. And this was a huge that they did a New York Times piece on this. And the point is, it's interesting. Like people, you know, order of operations, people were really getting very feisty about it on Facebook. But the bigger issue with what's happening with math, unless we need to deconstruct this problem, because I've learned if I talk about math and don't actually talk about math, people get mad about it. Does anyone need to like really understand this? Are we good to move on? What do you think, Deena? Are we good to move on? I think so. Okay. If you want to discuss it, like drop a note in the chat and we can keep the conversation going. Okay. So the bigger thing is, I'm sure you all know, you're experiencing everyday in schools, that math scores in this country have not really been great. And COVID didn't help. But I would say pre COVID, it wasn't that great. But the new data just came out with the NAEP scores. And between 2019 and 2024, not a lot of states, actually, things got a little worse. But I'm not here to be doomsday about it. I do want to show you that, you know, this has been from 1992 to 2024. What do you notice between eighth and fourth grade? Have we really done a lot to help students with math? No, no, I mean, COVID happened right in the middle of there. And COVID did not do us any favor when it talks about best practices and mathematics. But then you see headlines like this across all ages and demographics test results show Americans are getting dumber. Thank you news. Or there's math wars happening. This is from Ed week, even just last month, how there's a lot of there's different camps now, like you heard of the reading wars, but now there's procedural fluency versus conceptual understanding. How do we end the math wars? How do we support teachers and knowing what to do? And I'm sure you probably know this. But if you don't, if students are not successful in algebra one, algebra one is like a it's a hinge point in their in their career, it sets them up for so much success in the future. And if they don't pass algebra one, they are on a completely different path for the rest of their life. Then you layer that with math anxiety. And not just math anxiety, math trauma. trauma is different from anxiety. Anxiety is just getting a little bit anxious when you're doing math. But then what happens is with that anxiety is not addressed, it actually turns into a neurobiological impact on your brain when it comes to math. So when I go through the headlines, I feel like this, how many of you are maybe on a ball, like what's happening. So this is why the rest of our time today, we are going to talk about what we can do, because things that worked 10 years ago are still going to work today. But there's different tools to make it even more efficient. So I want us to lean into using neuroscience and talk about some best practices when it comes to mathematics. Because we want to move our students from math anxiety to success. So just a quick question, how many of you on this, you can do a plus one in the chat, if you have your camera on, you can do a thumbs up, have experienced math anxiety, or math trauma. That's me, I have to. How many of you know students that have some math trauma or math anxiety? Yeah, it's becoming, there's another article that I read one in five adults hates math, not just doesn't like that, like I'm talking hates it. So our goal today is to share with you some best practices and things we can do to win back the joy in mathematics. So the first thing is, I'm sure you know, but if you don't, this is all based on research and neuroscience. Rewriting brains with growth mindset language will help students learn more math. What do I mean by this? Our brains physically grow when we learn, they're not like growing out of our skull, they form new neural pathways when we learn. However, the way we learn, right, we want to make sure that we're doing the right neural pathways. So a couple of reframes, instead of students who say I can't do this, I'm bad at math, you can have students start with neuro pathway builder statements like mistakes help my brain grow. I haven't learned this yet. I may not know it today. And I will still try these simple things. I know it sounds so simple, but just having these statements on the wall. And if students can be seen these statements, it will start to change brain chemistry, they will start to see it, believe it, say it, and it will change the brains, then they'll start to act it. There's lots of research that shows this. How many of you have ever seen this graphic before? I love this graphic. It's from James Nottingham. Joe Bowler also references this in her, her research. But this is one of the best graphics I've seen about neuroplasticity, learning, grit, growth mindset, these are all terms that I feel like I've turned into posters and died on the wall. So we want to bring these back. But this is how kids learn. But unfortunately, when it especially comes to mathematics, a lot of times, if you have students, and I'm going to say adults too, you think you know the answer, it's not as easy as I thought, or you get something wrong, and then you're in the pit. Our goal is to get students and teachers out of the pit into the understanding piece. And right here, right at the edge of struggle, that's where the deepest learning comes in. So when we talk about mathematics, when Dina is going to share from her, tons of expertise in practice, how can we create the right environments to give students the container to calm their brains to really do this important productive struggle, so they can learn math and also let's make it a little bit fun to how do we make it fun, you need to lower stress with the power of relationships. Positive relationships trigger oxytocin in our brain, which is the trust hormone, which reduces anxiety and increases motivation. And again, lots of research has shown this. So that strong relationships with students actually matter more than the content that you're teaching. I'm going to pause on this. Because there's like I started with all those headlines, there's the math wars and this and that and what am I teaching and are my students practicing enough? None of that matters, y'all, if they don't think the teacher likes them. Relationships are the most important thing and that is special when it comes to mathematics. Students are not trusting themselves, students are stressed out. So having a strong relationship can very much help students learn math. So maybe open the class with a math check-in where they can do a quick write or a quick turn and talk. I always start my sessions with mood meters because they're quick, they're a little bit funny, and you can get a gauge on where people are. So even starting a math class with a quick mood meter, how are you feeling on a scale of cats? Kids laugh, they start to smile, oxytocin starts to be in their brain, lowers their cortisol, they're ready to learn math, and you get a gauge on what they're thinking or how they're feeling. But relationships matter so much. Other quick things that you can do, baby animals. Right, just like how are you feeling right now seeing these little cute little goats or my dog smiling. That's how she smiles with her bottom teeth. When we want students to really problem solve and persevere through math, starting before they attempt something difficult, putting a picture of a baby coat or something cute actually helps them connect more with their brains and lower their cortisol and get ready to open up that prefrontal cortex for problem solving. So something so simple as even having students turn and talk about their feelings, a mood meter, a fuzzy animal, all of this helps get them back into the learning zone. So you all shared math anxiety is real, but it is also reversible. This is not a lifetime thing. You don't have to, you know, I hear people all the time, I'm not a math person. That is not a lifetime affliction. Our brains are always growing. So here's how math anxiety works. It activates the amygdala. Have you all heard about the amygdala? Yes, no. Yeah. The fight, flight, freeze, and then they've added research, a fawning. And by the way, if you think about it, what do you do when you get stressed out? Are you fighter? Do you flight, freeze, fawn? I am a freezer. I would have been eaten by all the tigers. Literally, I'm like, what about you, Dina? What happens when you get stressed out? You know, it honestly depends on the type of stress. I think I kind of embrace all three of them. Yeah, it depends on where I am and what it is. When it comes, math anxiety is, I've done a lot of math, y'all. But let me tell you, when I have to write, I am probably, I freeze. Writing is probably more of my kryptonite than the mathematics. Right. And I'm glad that you shared that. Thank you. Because there isn't always just one. Like, you can have multiple reactions to it, just like there's not always one of everything, just like there's not one way to solve a math problem. But what's interesting about this is, when you start to get anxious about math, your amygdala is really close to your hippocampus in your brain, which converts short term memory to long term memory, which impacts learning. And also, the emotional aspects of your brain are right next to the amygdala. So if that is getting hijacked, that's blocking any problem solving ability. And for the middle school teachers out there that have 42 minutes to teach math, it's been proven that if you get stressed, it's hijacked, right? That means your prefrontal cortex has shot off for about 20 minutes. That's half the math class, half the math class, y'all. And that's not even middle school anxiety. That's math anxiety. If kids come in from the hallway having fought with somebody, that's why it's really important to be able to shift the focus back to learning. And that's where some of those neuroscience tricks like showing a fuzzy puppy, smiling, making sure that having the positive relationships, breathing. So simple. But if you notice, you have a room full of middle school students who came in all whatever, taking a collective deep breath can start to calm cortisol levels and get students brains focused back on learning. Movement helps, and so does music. So one of the activities that I often share, and I love this song, which I actually realized I can't play it because we're going to be putting this on YouTube. So this part would be any of your favorite song, doing math moves. So you could have, I would actually have students make numbers with their butts. Yep, you heard me correctly. I have students do a little dance, stand up. I'm talking middle school kids, stand up, do the the equation dance, sit back down. Deena, you have a story about movement, don't you? Yeah, I used to have my students, we did all sorts of movement in my classroom. We did human graphing to, and I made my classroom a giant coordinate plane to have them stand up and move and figure out where they fit. And let me tell y'all, I taught, I told you, I'm an old teacher, I taught back in the olden days, not really the olden days, but I had 36 kids in my room and we still made human graphing work. We did arm movements. Is it linear? Is it, you know, a quadratic? And I would have students use arm movements and motion to talk about different types of graphs. And I will say this is also one of the reasons why having a really good opener to your lesson is so important because Danielle's right, 20 minutes, that's basically the bulk of your instructional time. But if you can get students brains going, have a really good warm up activity, discussion question, something that allows us to access and engage with the content and get going right away, something that builds their buy-in, you're going to reduce that stress level. I am, I am not quite the dancing aficionado that Danielle is. So I was less inclined to dance, but you can still do really great lesson openers and come up with some ideas that your class will love that will get the lesson started and reduce that stress level. Absolutely. Thank you. Okay. Another, I'm going to just tack on to Dina's story too. My senior year in high school, I took AP calculus with a teacher who was absolutely amazing. She had to stand on chairs and do co-sign and sign aerobics. Like I, I loved her so much that I actually took calculus in college. I did not do well, nor did I like it nearly as much. But the fact that this teacher made me want to take calculus in college, one positive connection with an adult can make the world of difference for students. So if you can be that person as a math educator, that can even make a more profound impact on students. So other steps, making math visual, hands on and loud. If you walk into a math classroom and it is silent and they are not taking an assessment, they are not learning as deeply as they could be. Brains also process images 60,000 times faster than text. So meet the fact that I'm showing you a bunch of text. That's why I'm mixing in the images a little bit more. Kinesthetic learning strategies help strengthen memory. That's why we're talking about the math aerobics movement. Even having students draw pictures in math using math doodles, showing the equations, then showing pictorial representations, letting students sketch their thinking before problem solving and having students talk to each other. We cannot stress this enough. A loud classroom is a productive classroom, especially when it comes to mathematics. Students, I know after COVID, rows seem to be the classroom management strategy preferred, but that is not effective for learning. Do you want to say anything about that, Dina? I feel like I have a sandbox. I have a lot to say about that. I'll do that when you pass it over and I get to share my set of slides. Okay, great. So just examples of this, if you have students be able to share their thinking in doodles, like for me, I was both an auditory and a visual learner, but having students sketch things out when you ask them to solve a problem, solve it both in an equation way, but also in a pictorial way that will help embrace the learning and then having them turning and talking. The final thing I want to share offering about the neuroscience piece is we really need to find ways to normalize mistakes. And I know I've worked with so many educators across the country, actually so many educators globally. Educators are so hard on themselves. We still have a perfectionist plague and educators don't want to make mistakes, but I'm telling you, learning, learning requires mistakes. You need to try something new, screw it up, figure out why, try it again, especially in mathematics. And the science about making mistakes, it activates the anterior cingulate cortex, which it's another signal to your brain that adjusts and improves learning. So here's one offering about making mistakes. And if we were live, I would show you this a little bit deeper, but there's something called failure to DAW. And there are guardrails around this. I wouldn't just do this. Meaning when you make mistakes, everyone claps. You don't want to use it as a humiliation tool. But here's an example. As a teacher, I'm modeling a problem, or I'm working with a student and I screw up. I ask for all the students to clap for me. And what that does is typically when we make mistakes, how do you all feel? If you make a mistake, probably horrible, shameful. Like you don't really want to share that you made a mistake by doing an activity like failure to DAW. So normalizing mistakes by clapping for it, it flips the script on mistakes. So we're going to try this. So even though your cameras are off, I'm still going to want you to clap wherever you are. Even if you just clap in your head, that's fine. When I show you a mistake that I made. So this is how many of you have ever seen American Ninja Warrior show? American Ninja Warrior is probably one of the best shows out there about grit and perseverance. People are defying gravity, doing these crazy obstacles. And then when they fall, they're out for the entire season. And they're like, Oh, well, just, we'll just keep coming back and just keep trying it again. Well, I don't know why I thought it was a great idea to go to the American Ninja Warrior gym after I hadn't worked out. Let's see what happens. This is the bar I'm trying to get. You ready? That's me. Okay, one more time. And then I want everyone to clap. Let's just try this one more time. So this is me. That's, thank you. That's what I mean by clapping for mistakes. So you could have students identify anonymous mistakes. Every Friday, you could pull from a mistake jar and everyone clap. If you're making a mistake on the board, do it on purpose and have students clap. It's a way to normalize things. It's a little tricky in middle school, a little tricky in high school, because you don't want kids to start making fun of each other. But that's just one activity to enjoy a little laughter and celebration for mistakes. So now I would love to know with this neuroscience piece, what's something you learned or something you may want to take back. I just love to take a second. If you want to come off mute, that's great. Or you can just type in the chat. I'll just give you like 30 seconds. And Brandy, oh great. Brandy has her students do math doodles. Awesome. Thank you for sharing, Brandy. Danielle, while folks are thinking, I'll just share too. I worked with a math teacher who she taught eighth grade pre-algebra, which, you know, kids in that class were very sensitive about mistakes. And she didn't want to do anything super public because she knew that students would get very anxious and upset about it. So what she would do is when they made mistakes, she would write them on index cards, on larger index cards, and she would post them on the wall. And at the end of the week, they took a quiz every Friday, you could solve the mistakes on the wall on your quiz for extra credit points. And if it was your mistake that you got to that you solved and you solved it correctly, and made a note about it, you would get like two points instead of one point. And she used that mistake error analysis as a way to support learning. Also, a lot of kids would say, they're like, Hey, I think that's my mistake. And they started they started owning them by the end of the year, they were like, I think I did that half the time, it wasn't even their mistake. But they were willing to own it because it was on the board. And it was helping the rest of the class get extra credit. And they were kind of proud of that. So that was a really great strategy for getting the mistakes, getting students more comfortable with what it means to make mistakes and how to learn from them. I love that. It's like that's the introverts version and the mind's the extroverts version. Absolutely. So whatever best practice that you use, this again, this is the point of these. So you take something back with you. So we had in the chat, thank you, Dina, for that story. I love starting with cuteness and jokes. Yep, always starting to activate a little bit of humor, having students smile. That's great. The learning pit was helpful. And then showing cuteness at the start of an activity gets to get students ready for learning. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing in the chat. So now I am going to pass it over to Dina, who's going to start to share her slides and really dig into best practices around what we're thinking about Khan Academy and Khanmigo. All right, am I good on my screen sharing? All right. So I want to actually pick up a little bit. We're going to talk about using AI and specifically using Khanmigo with some of these mindset tasks. But I want to start with some of the things that you all just shared. Images of cute pets, classroom jokes. Those are all super fun things to start a class with, things that are fun to put on the board. But getting started can be a little bit challenging. Using AI to help with that, asking Khanmigo or asking an AI tool, can you give me five jokes for this week, one for each day to get started? Once you start, kids are going to get pretty excited and they're going to want to contribute and they're going to bring you things. They're going to bring you pictures of their pets. They're going to bring you a dad joke that somebody said. But when you're first trying to build that culture, sometimes it takes a little bit to get students invested. So just building from where we were, leveraging AI to help you with some of those culture components, it's pretty great at doing that as well as the math content. All right. So I want to talk a little bit about math instruction, specifically how we build our lessons, how we scaffold what happens in the classroom. This is more like what my classroom used to look like. Students kind of everywhere. It was never quiet. It was always loud. We were always problem solving. We were always working on applications. I taught Algebra 1. I love teaching Algebra 1. It is my favorite. I taught just about everything, but Algebra 1 still has a dear place in my heart because I think it's so critical for students to know and understand Algebra 1 and to give them a really great experience to do problem-based learning, project-based learning, and understand the why behind what they're doing. Giving them that opportunity sets them up and sets their career for a lifetime of success, I hope, in mathematics. But I was a middle school math specialist in 2020, and coming back from the pandemic was incredibly challenging. Classrooms that looked like this, that had students in groups, that had students everywhere, became this. It became students sitting at a computer, sitting in isolation, just focused on their one little task. We were all so worried about what did they miss that fourth quarter, right? Because the world essentially closed after the third quarter of the 1920 school year. All the kids were sent home during the fourth quarter. Some kids had things to do. They had teachers that gave lessons. Other kids, not so much. And then in 2020, we were trying to figure out what to do. Some children were learning from home. Some were coming back to classrooms, but they were masked up. They were behind plastic barriers. There was no room for conversation because even if you did talk, you couldn't hear through the plastic and through the mask and everything else. And it was just, it was a trying time. Teachers were doing their best to figure it out. And, you know, no, absolutely no disrespect to teachers that gave students digital assignments. We were all doing the very best that we could and trying to find our path forward. But what we saw and what ended up happening is that students were working in isolation. We used digital products to tell us what students, what gaps students had because we were so terrified of those gaps from the fourth quarter. And what we ended up doing is students ended up spending all this time filling gaps and working off of grade level. And then they kept working off of grade level. And then they kept working off of grade level. And then now we're back to where Danielle showed you. Our scores are down. We're going down, down, down, and we're not making that much improvement. But how could we be making improvement? Our kids aren't doing grade level standards. They're not working on the content that we're assessing them on. They're not working on the same content across a classroom. And we're trying to figure out how to do, how to be all things to all people. And where does that leave us? It leaves us putting kids on a laptop by themselves working on their individual pathway. But just because we want to individualize, just because we want to differentiate, doesn't mean we have to isolate. And I think we have to be very careful with what and how we do that. I want you to think about and just take a minute. How much time do students in your school or your district, how much time do they spend working off of grade level content? And then on the opposite side of that, how much time do they spend working and how much opportunity do they have to work on grade level? On those grade level standards at the rigor and the level that we want them to be working? And then how often do we adapt? What do you think? I'd love to have you drop it in the chat. What do you think is the distribution in your school, classroom, building? What do you think? Do you, is it 25, 75, 50, 50? Where do you feel like you are? Or you can guess, where do you think education is in general if you don't want to be specific to your building? I think 70, 30. 70 being off or on grade level? Uh, okay, 60, 40. 60 on, 40 off. Okay. 45% on. Thanks, Michelle. I, I think I have probably, um, you know, I, I see a lot of classrooms and I talk to a lot of educators and I think it's probably somewhere in that 50, 50 range to be honest. And that is a lot of time, right? That's a lot of minutes. That's a lot of work that students are doing to try to fill in gaps and spending, spending that time working below on things that are not part of their state assessment on things that we think that they should have learned that we've passed them by and the clock keeps ticking, right? We're moving them on, we're moving them forward and students know that. And I want you to think about what Danielle was sharing, you know, if, if they're going to shut down for 20 minutes because they get stressed, because they get anxious, they know that focus ticking. They know they are behind. If they are still doing multiplication in middle school, I know that they know and they feel that. And that just makes that anxiety build even more. It makes it even stronger. And it's so, so difficult, but it's not just the kids. I want to take a moment and I want to acknowledge the teachers. Our teachers, okay, this was me, old teacher, I used to plan, I used to have stacks of books everywhere. My hair never looked that great while I was planning. It was usually up in like a wild messy bun. But thank you, I appreciate that. I had piles and piles because I was looking for tasks. I was looking for just the right thing to get my students engaged. My friend, Dina Lo, had a quote published in Ejitopia that I love and I have held on to. And it said, if you're lesson planning and don't have 20 tabs open, are you really even lesson planning? If you're not looking through and pouring through all of these resources to try to bring your kids into this learning experience, what are you doing? But you know what the truth is, our teachers have anxiety too. They have tried to prepare a lesson for each group of students, for each learning need. They are trying to engage kids, they're trying to take care of kids, they've got their introverts, they've got their extroverts. And there's a lot of anxiety that comes with even just lesson planning and with our teachers trying to create the best possible learning experiences. And we've asked them to teach remotely and using this technology and using that. And it can be a lot. So that math anxiety, you know, and we talked about how many of you have felt have felt math anxiety, our teachers feel that too. So just recognizing that it's our students and our teachers and the clock keeps ticking. The teachers know they've got so much to teach. They don't have enough days because they've got this thing happening and that thing happening and they've got tests upon tests upon tests. That time is so precious. And so what I want to think about for a second, I want to think about these three terms. We talk about these all the time in education, scaffold, differentiate, and remediate. We say them, you've got to scaffold learning, you've got to differentiate learning, you've got to remediate. These are more things that take time. But what do these terms all have in common? Please, you're welcome to come off of mute. You're welcome to drop it in the chat. But what do you think? What do these have in common? Supporting students where they are. What else? I'm going to say yes and that's something that Danielle has. You're also really good at independent thing, time and wait time. You can wait time. You can take a math educator. I'm like, what else? What else everybody? I taught middle school. I will wait forever. They require teacher action. The other thing, nobody's got time for them. And we can't always agree what they how do we do this? We know that we need to support students where they are. We know that they require action. But what exactly does that look like? How exactly do we scaffold? Do we differentiate? And do we remediate? They're critical components of instruction that we have always struggled to find time for. And I think that these three are the top reasons why if you're not currently using AI in math classrooms, you have to because AI makes these possible like they've never been possible before. It makes differentiation possible. It makes scaffolding unbelievably realistic. And it it helps students it meets each child where they are. And it does so in a way that's respectful. It does so in a way that can keep them on grade level and still filling gaps, which we've never been able to do before. I listen for as much as I talk about being an old teacher. And I'm kind of lying. I was a little bit skeptical at first with this AI business coming because I've been through many a fad. I've been through many things that have swept through math education. And I taught middle school. So I've got a little bit of that personality like prove it to me before I actually use something. But the truth is, it works. And I've seen it work. And I've watched children engaged. I've watched them come out of their show. In particular, I heard a story just last week from a district partner about a group of children who have IEPs. They tend to not engage in classroom conversations very often because they're very anxious about it. And they were talking about how they're using AI to practice conversations, and how it's bringing them out of their shell. And for the first time ever, she went into the class. And it was noisy. She went into a math class that's always silent and quiet. And it was noisy for the first time she's ever seen. And I was like, yes, that's what this is about. That's what we are doing. So what I want to talk about for a couple minutes is, we have this opportunity right now, right here, right now, today, this afternoon, tomorrow, if you want, we can change the way that we're teaching math. We no longer have to have problems about Joseph's mom buying 60 watermelons, and how we're going to divvy up watermelons. We can have real, actual mathematical tasks that are meaningful to kids that are differentiated based on what they are interested in, based on what they want to know. And I'm going to say, if we use AI and say, please give me 10 problems to solve for linear equations, that is a waste of AI. Do you need 10 problems? Yes, maybe. But it's yes and. Give me linear equations and Fortnite, Pokemon, Taylor Swift, sloths, cute puppies, dad jokes, whatever you want. Yes. And we have the chance to put some flair into our learning. We can pair things like we never have before. My child is currently taking algebra and civics. So when we do problems, we, he loves his civics. He fights me on algebra because he's my child. And so we pair those civics and the algebra together. We have paired the Civil War naval waterways with combining like terms in sixth grade math because he loves social studies. So I anchor the math in the social studies. Am I a social studies expert? No, but AI gives me enough knowledge and enough opportunity that I can create these learning tasks to help him understand and to give him relevance so that he can learn in a way that makes sense for him and helps him ground his work. And what happens as a teacher when I do that? AI does that for me in seconds. I don't have to sit and sift through books upon books upon books. I don't have to go through 25 browser tabs anymore. What I can do is I can create those tasks with AI. And the time that I have left, I can put it back into building relationships with my students. I can give them more feedback on their work. I don't have to give them just digital work, because I'm not grading, you know, I'm giving them tasks, I want them to work through, I want to see their writing. If I'm not spending two hours lesson planning, I can spend at least one of those hours giving feedback on their work, looking at what they're writing, looking at how they're solving problems, celebrating the work that they're doing and cheering them on where I see them finding success. This was actually just in Ed week today. There was an article about how AI is changing the way math teachers plan lessons. Great article with some really good starters in there. If you haven't done much of this yet. All right, a few more pieces I want to talk about your role as a leader. Because my job at Khan Academy is to work with school districts to come up with implementation plans and figure out how to best integrate AI into what you're already doing. We're not replacing, you know, well, I mean, we could, we could replace some things. But what we're doing is we're working with your goals, with your curricula, with your assessment plans. And we're helping you come up with a really nice way to save time and work more efficiently using AI. And there are a few things that we've learned that I want to share with you, because I think these are really important. AI has the power to change math instruction to change the way we teach, and to reduce that anxiety if we do it well. But as a leader, we have to set our educators up for success so that they can do this. So there are three really key points that I want to share that have been critical in implementations. Number one, have a purpose. Don't just do AI because you're like, hey, we're just gonna do AI because we just are. Have a clear starting point. Teachers are overwhelmed. They need clarity, and they need to know we're doing this for a specific purpose. Allow time to learn. And as a leader, you better model that learning too. Play with AI yourself, work in it. And remember that while innovation is exciting, change can be tough. And so giving room for some of that productive struggle, but making sure that we work our way through productive struggle is critical. So first, one clear purpose you could have is supporting teachers with high quality instructional resources. Maybe you just want to help make sure that they start and close each lesson with a really strong activity. You start with something that's going to engage students, that's going to reduce that anxiety, and you close with a really nice formative assessment. That is an okay implementation plan. That will get you going, that will get you started, and that provides clarity for teachers to know exactly what you are hoping. And also, it gives them clear direction in a way that they can use AI. College and career readiness. This is one of my favorite pieces of Khan Academy. And we see this used all across the US. Digital SAT resources, financial literacy, college admissions, careers, personal finances. We even have Adulting 101 that I've started taking myself because I think it's a great course. But really using it to make sure that using Conmigo to make sure that students are prepared for what comes next. Improving Algebra 1. Listen, I told you this is my favorite, but this is also a really hard topic in a lot of places in a lot of districts. We have resources, we have best practices that mean no work, we have efficacy research, we know that this is impactful. And Conmigo can help students. It can coach them right alongside as they're doing exercises. It can quiz them, it can help them refresh their knowledge, it can give them practice problems. It's right there with them. It's their companion. I want to come back to this graphic that Danielle showed. So many students end up at the bottom of the pit because they've been doing math and they've been doing math. In particular, students who try to do math in their head find out, oh, it's not as easy as I thought. Now there's all these steps and I can't do it in my head anymore. And they end up at the bottom of the pit, but they've been doing work on computers for the last four years since the pandemic. And they don't really know how to write and show their work all that well anymore. And they're confused and they give up. And that is a really tough place to be, especially in Algebra 1 because they're going to have to repeat it. They're going to have to do it again. And the second time, we're not guaranteed that it's going to make any more sense without the right skills, without the right coping mechanisms to be able to ask questions, to be able to exercise those critical thinking skills and those organizational skills. This is tough. If nothing else, Algebra 1 is a great place to start with AI implementations. So let us know if you want to chat about that. The last one, make time to learn. Make time for teachers to practice. Make time with professional learning, focusing on one thing at a time. Make space for collaboration, for sharing ideas, and practice what you preach. Study AI too. Have it help you write some emails. Try creating some handouts. See what you can do with it. There's a lot of great stuff in there. Because change is tough. And we want to make sure that we don't get stuck in the danger zone. We want to make sure that we don't get trapped in our own pit of understanding where we get confused and we just stop. We want to work through the different stages of the change cycle and make sure that we can be successful as leaders by empowering our teachers to support students. And the best way we can do that is to free up their time. So I'm going to pass it back to Danielle to wrap us up. Thank you, Dina. So I would love while I'm about to share my screen, what did you just learn from that section? What is your takeaway from what Dina just shared? If we go ahead in the chat. I lost my chat. There it is. I'm not as good about wait time as she is. Okay, the power of calm me go. Yeah, you can use AI to help with scaffolding. Yes, yes, you can. Absolutely. The broad range of skills and the options and AI will definitely save time. Thank you. So to find out more, I'm actually just putting a link in the chat right now. This is what we did. We talked about the current state of math, and it doesn't have to be that way. These all the things that Dina was sharing, those are universal best practices. Same thing, the neuroscience universal universal best practices, because I think now is the time to be the change we want to see mathematically. We have been okay for too long with 40% proficiency in eighth graders and fourth graders. And that's just not okay. There's especially middle school math. Oh my goodness, middle school math is a math we use every single day in our lives. So it's, I just think we can bring some joy back, we can bring problem solving back, and we are in the right time with these tools. So next steps, I shared the landing page for this webinar series. If you're interested in learning more, you can watch a demo. You can book time to meet with me around this, but keep learning with us. Next month, we're going to be really digging into relationships, engagement, and connection, and how we're going to leverage AI to use those. And again, this will be best practices you can take immediately back into your buildings. In May, we're going to have some fun, right? Like we talked about improv. I love how Dina kept saying, yes, and, well, I am the yes, and queen. So be prepared to have a lot of fun in May. And then in June, we will cover what's coming. We have a little bit of a rebrand, not a rebrand, but some new exciting things coming for Back to School 26. We'll do some previews there. So I appreciate you. Please share this. If you watch this recording, thank you for watching the recording. Again, my name is Danielle Sullivan. This is how to get ahold of me. We would love to partner with your district, but until we meet again, have a wonderful rest of your day. Thanks so much, Dina, for being here. Thank you for watching. We appreciate you. And keep in touch. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. They are in case anyone else has questions. All right, we can, I'll end it. Thank you, Dina.
