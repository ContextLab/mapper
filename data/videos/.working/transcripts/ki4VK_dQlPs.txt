We've been doing several videos now to establish a bunch of truths of definite integrals of various combinations of trigonometric functions so that we will have a really strong mathematical basis for actually finding the Fourier coefficients. And I think we only have one more video to go. In the last video, we said, hey, if you take any combinations of signs where m and n are integers that either don't equal each other or don't equal the negative of each other, then you're gonna get that integral is going to be equal to zero. And then if they did equal to each other, well, it's just gonna be the same thing as sine squared of some multiple of t. And that that, actually, over the interval from zero to two pi is going to be equal to pi. And just to be clear, I wasn't as clear as I should have been in the last video. This is going to be true where m is a non-zero integer. If m was zero, then the inside of this integral would just simplify to zero, and then the integral would be zero. So m has to be a non-zero integer for this right over here to be true. Now, what we wanna do in this video is do the same thing we did in the last video, but now do it for cosines, that the product of two cosines where m and n are different integers or they're not the negative of each other, that that's going to be zero. But if they are the same integer and they are not zero, so that will boil down to cosine squared of mt, that that is going to be equal, this definite integral is going to be equal to pi. And we're gonna do it the same way that we did it with the signs. We are going to use some of our trigonometric identities. And so let's rewrite this right over here, what we're trying to take the integral of. And so this is going to be the integral from zero to two pi. So cosine mt times cosine nt using a product to sum a trig identity, and if this is unfamiliar, you can review it on Khan Academy. That is going to be 1 1 by 2 times cosine of the difference of mt minus nt. So I could write that as m minus nt, m minus nt plus cosine of mt plus nt, which I could write as m plus nt dt. So let's think about two situations. Let's think about the first situation. When, and let me do that dt in blue. So dt, so when, actually let me now use some integration properties to expand this out a little bit. This is going to be equal to, so I'm gonna write this as two different integrals. So one integral from zero to two pi, and I'm gonna put the dt right over here, and then have an other integral from zero to two pi, and I'm gonna throw that dt out here. And so just using some integration properties is gonna be 1 1 by 2 times this integral of cosine of m minus nt dt, and then plus, I'm just distributing the 1 by 2 and using some integration properties, 1 by 2, and now this integral is gonna be cosine of m plus n, m plus nt dt. Now let's think about it. When m and n are integers that don't equal each other, don't equal their n negatives, so let's think about m not equaling n, or m not equaling negative n, and we're always assuming that these things are going to be integers, m and n. Well in that situation, this right over here is going to be a non-zero integer, and this right over here is going to be a non-zero integer, and we've already established, we've already established that if you have a non-zero coefficient here, that this definite integral is going to be equal to zero, the definite integral from zero to two pi of cosine of some non-zero integer times t dt. Well that's exactly what both of these integrals are. This is the integral from zero to two pi of cosine times some non-zero integer t, or non-zero integer times t dt. So in this case, where m and n are integers that don't equal each other, or don't equal the negatives of each other, both of these integrals are going to be zero, and then you're going to multiply that times 1 half, 1 half times zero is zero, 1 half times zero is zero, it's all going to end up being zero. So that should, so that should hopefully make you feel pretty good about the case, this first case. And now let's think about the second case, where m is a non-zero integer, or we could say where m is equal to n. So in that situation, n and m are the same, and they are not equal to zero. So let's just take that situation, especially because when we're looking at Fourier coefficients, we care about the non-negative coefficients, at least the way that we've defined it. So let's just assume that m is equal to n, and that there, and that m is not equal to zero. Well, and that would just resolve, that would take this integral and turn it into that integral. Well, in that situation, what's gonna happen? Well, this first integral right over here, if m is equal to n and m is not equal to zero, well, it's gonna be m minus m. You're gonna get, this is gonna be zero t, so this whole thing is going to simplify to one. And then this right over here, you're gonna have m plus m, that's going to simplify to 2m. And so let's rewrite the integrals here. This is going to be equal to 1 half times the definite integral from zero to 2 pi, zero to 2 pi of one times, I'll write that one here, one dt, one dt, plus 1 half, plus 1 half, that's a new color, times the integral from zero to 2 pi of cosine, let me do it in that situation, same, of cosine of 2m t dt. 2m t d dt. So once again, we're assuming m is not equal to zero, this is the definite integral from zero to 2 pi of cosine times some non-zero coefficient times t. Well, once again, we've established multiple times that this is going to be zero, so this whole second term is going to be zero. And this first one is going to be equal to, let's go to neutral color, it's going to be 1 half times the antiderivative of one, well that's just t, evaluated from zero to 2 pi, so that's going to be equal to 1 half times 2 pi minus zero, 2 pi minus zero, well that's just 1 half times 2 pi, which is equal to pi. And so we have now established this one as well. And now we have a full toolkit. We now have a full toolkit for evaluating the Fourier coefficients, which we will now do in the next video, which is very exciting.
