Let's review a little bit of what we know about exponents. So if I were to have three to the second power times three to the third power, times three to the third power, what does that equal? Well, we could expand it out just as a review. Three to the second power, well that's going to be three times three, three times three, and then three to the third power, we're going to multiply it by three to the third power, three to the third power is going to be three times three times three. So what is this going to be equal to? Well, this is going to be equal to three to the two plus three power. Three to the two plus three power. Two to the three, two plus three power. And this comes straight out of what an exponent is. This is, we're taking two threes and multiplying it together and then we're going to multiply that with three threes being multiplied together. So you're going to end up with two plus three or five threes being multiplied together. So this of course is going to be equal to, this of course is going to be equal to three to the fifth power. Three to the, three to the fifth power. And that's a little bit of a review. This is one of the core exponent properties. If you have the same base multiplied two exponents and you're taking the product of those two expressions, you can essentially, or you do, just add the exponents. Three to some exponent times three to some other exponent is going to be three to the sum of those two exponents. So that's kind of interesting, but now let's use this property right over here to try to think about what a negative exponent should be. So we're going to try to think about what should, what should three to the negative, let's just say three to the negative two power. What should this be equal to? And I encourage you to pause this video and think about it. Think about what should this be equal to if we want this property to hold, that if you have the same base raised to different exponents that you can just take the sum, and you're taking the product of those two expressions, that you can take that base to the sum of those two exponents. Well let's try a little experiment here. Let's try a little experiment. What should three squared, three squared, times three, times three to the negative two power b? What should this be equal to? Well if we want to keep this property going, this should be equal to three to the two, to the two plus negative two power, two plus negative two, which of course would be equal to, which would be equal to three to the zeroth power, three to the zeroth power, and any non-zero number to the zeroth power is going to be equal to one. So this should be equal to one. So we should define three to the negative two in some way so that three squared times three to the negative two should be equal to one. We need to do that if we want this property to hold, if we want this property to hold right over there. So let's just think about what three to the negative two should actually be. So we want this to equal one. Let me copy and paste that so that we can manipulate it a little bit algebraically. So let me copy and let me paste it. All right, so we have that on one side. We want that to be equal to one. Let me clean this up a little bit. We want that to be equal to one. So to define three to the negative two, or to think about what three to the negative two should be, let's divide both sides by three squared. Let's divide both sides by that. So let me copy that. So we're going to divide this side by that and we're going to divide this side by that. And let me draw a line so that you know that we're dividing. So we're going to divide the left hand by that and the right hand by that. Well, three squared over three squared, those cancel out. And now we get a really interesting result. We get that three to the negative two power, three to the negative two power should be equal to one, should be equal to one over three to the second power. One over three to the second power. And I really want you to internalize this right over here. You have something to the negative power, to the negative two power in this case. That's equal to one over three to the positive version of that exponent. And this is true in general. In the next video, we'll use a very similar argument to prove this for any non-zero base and any exponent that raising it to the negative should be if you want this exponent property to hold, that you would add the exponents when you were taking the product of the same base raised to different exponents. If you want that property to hold, if you raise something to the negative exponent, it should be one over that base raised to the positive version of that exponent. So three to the negative two power is one over three squared, which is equal to one over nine.
