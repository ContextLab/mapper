In the last video, we set out to find the eigenvalues of this 3 by 3 matrix A. And we said, look, an eigenvalue is any value lambda that satisfies this equation if v is a non-zero vector. And that says, well, that means any value lambda that satisfies this equation for v is not a non-zero vector. We just did a little bit of vector, I guess you could call it vector algebra up here, to come up with that and review that video if you like. And then we determined, look, the only way that this is going to have a non-zero solution is if this matrix has a non-trivial null space, and only non-invertible matrices have a non-trivial null space, or only matrices that have a determinant of 0 have non-trivial null spaces. So you do that. You've got your characteristic polynomial, and we were able to solve it. And we got our eigenvalues, where lambda is equal to 3, and lambda is equal to minus 3. So now let's do what I consider the more interesting part, is actually find out the eigenvectors, or the eigens spaces. So we can go back to this equation. For any eigenvalue, this must be true. But this is easier to work with. And so this matrix right here times your eigenvector must be equal to 0 for any given eigenvalue. This matrix right here, I just copied and pasted it from above, I marked it up with the rule of SARS, but you could ignore those lines. It's just this matrix right here for any lambda. Lambda times the identity matrix minus a ends up being this. So let's take this matrix for each of our lambdas, and then solve for our eigenvectors, or our eigens spaces. So let's take the case of lambda is equal to 3 first. So if lambda is equal to 3, this matrix becomes lambda plus 1 is 4. Lambda minus 2 is 1. Lambda minus 2 is 1. And then all of the other terms stay the same. Minus 2, minus 2, minus 2, 1, minus 2 and 1. And then this times that vector v, or our eigenvector v, is equal to 0. Or we could say that the eigen space for the eigenvalue 3 is the null space of this matrix, which is not this matrix. It's lambda times the identity minus a. So the null space of this matrix is the eigen space. So all of the values that satisfy this make up the eigenvectors of the eigen space of lambda is equal to 3. So let's just solve for this. So the null space of this guy is, you could just put in reduced row echelon form. The null space of this guy is the same thing as the null space of this guy in reduced row echelon form. So let's put it in reduced row echelon form. So the first thing I want to do, let me just do it down here, so let me, I'll keep my first row the same for now, for minus 2, minus 2. And let me replace my second row with my second row times 2 plus my first row. So minus 2 times 2 plus 1 is 0. 1 times 2 plus minus 2 is 0. 1 times 2 plus minus 2 is 0. This row is the same as this row, so I'm going to do the same thing. Minus 2 times 2 plus 4 is 0. 1 times 2 plus 2 is 0. And then 1 times 2 plus minus 2 is 0. So the solutions to this equation are the same as the solutions to this equation. Let me write it like this. Instead of just writing the vector v, let me write it out. So v1, v2, v3 are going to be equal to the 0 vector. 0, 0, just rewriting it slightly different. And so these two rows, or these two equations, give us no information. The only one is this row up here, which tells us that 4 times v1 minus 2 times v2. Actually, this wasn't complete reduced row echelon form, but close enough, it's easy for us to work with. 4 times v1 minus 2 times v2 minus 2 times v3 is equal to 0. And let's just divide by 4. I could have just divided by 4 here, which might have made it, maybe I skipped a step. If you divide by 4, you get v1 minus 1 half v2 minus 1 half v3 is equal to 0. Or v1 is equal to 1 half v2 plus 1 half v3. Just added these guys to both sides of the equation. Or we could say, if we say that v2 is equal to, I don't know, it's equal to, I'm just going to put some random number, a. And v3 is equal to b. Then we can say, and then v1 would be equal to 1 half a plus 1 half b. We can say that the eigenspace for lambda is equal to 3 is the set of all vectors, v1, v2, v3, that are equal to a times, a times v2 is a, right? So v2 is equal to a times 1. V3 has no a in it, so it's a times 0. I'll save v1. Plus b times, v2 is just a, right? v2 has no b in it, so it's 0. V3 is 1 times, so 0 times a plus 1 times b. And then v1 is 1 half a plus 1 half b. 1 half and 1 half. For any a and b, I could really know such that a and b are members of the reals, just to be a little bit formal about it. So that's our eigen, any vector that satisfies this is an eigenvector, and they're the eigenvectors that correspond to the eigenvalue lambda is equal to 3. So if you apply the matrix transformation to any of these vectors, you're just going to scale them up by 3. Or you could say, let me write it this way. The eigenspace for lambda is equal to 3 is equal to the span, all of the potential linear combinations of this guy and that guy. So 1 half 1 0 and 1 half 0 1. So that's only one of the eigenspaces. That's the one that corresponds to lambda is equal to 3. Let's do the one that corresponds to lambda is equal to minus 3. So if lambda is equal to minus 3, I'll do it up here. I think I have enough space. Lambda is equal to minus 3. This matrix becomes, I'll do the diagonals, minus 3 plus 1 is minus 2. Minus 3 minus 2 is minus 5. Minus 3 minus 2 is minus 5. And then all the other things don't change. Minus 2 minus 2 1 minus 2 minus 2 and 1. And then that times vectors and the eigenspace that corresponds to lambda is equal to minus 3 is going to be equal to 0. I'm just applying this equation right here, which we just derived from that one over there. So we're looking at the eigenspace that corresponds to lambda is equal to minus 3 is the null space. This matrix right here are all the vectors that satisfy this equation. So what is the null space of this? It's the same thing as the null space of this in reduced row echelon form. So let's put it in reduced row echelon form. So the first thing I want to do, I'm going to keep my first row the same. I'm going to write a little bit smaller than I normally do, just because I think I'm going to run out of space. So minus 2 minus 2 minus 2. And then, actually, let me just do it this way. I will skip some steps. Let's just divide the first row by minus 2. So we get 1, 1, 1. And then let's replace this second row with the second row plus this version of the first row. So this guy plus that guy is 0 minus 5 plus minus, or let me say it this way. Let me replace it with the first row minus the second row. So minus 2 minus minus 2 is 0. Minus 2 minus minus 5 is plus 3. And then minus 2 minus 1 is minus 3. Minus 3, and let me do the last row. I'll just do it in a different color for fun. And I'll do the same thing. I'll do this row minus this row. So minus 2 minus minus 2 is 0. Minus 2 plus 2. Minus 2 minus 1 is minus 3. And then we have minus 2 minus minus 5. So that's minus 2 plus 5. So that is 3. Now let me replace. Now let me replace, and I'll do it in two steps. So this is 1, 1, 1. I'll just keep it like that. And actually, well, yeah, let me just keep it like that. And then let me replace my third row with my third row plus my second row. You just add these terms. These all just become 0. That guy got zeroed out. And let me take my second row and divide it by 3. So this becomes 0, 1, minus 1. And then I'm almost there. I'm almost there. I'll do it in orange. So let me replace my first row with my first row minus my second row. So this becomes 1, 0. And then 1 minus minus 1 is 2. And then the second row is 0, 1, minus 1. And then the last row is 0, 0, 0. So any v that satisfies this equation will also satisfy this guy. This guy's null space is going to be the null space of that guy in reduced row echelon form. So v1, v2, v3 is equal to 0, 0, 0. Let me move this, because I've officially run out of space. Let me move this lower down, where I have some free real estate. Let me move it down here. This corresponds to lambda is equal to minus 3. This was lambda is equal to minus 3, just to make us, you know, it's not related to this stuff right here. So what are all of the v1's, v2's, and v3's that satisfy this? So if we say that v3 is equal to t, then what do we have here? This tells us that v2 minus v3 is equal to 0. So it tells us that v2 minus v3, right? So 0 times v1 plus v2 minus v3 is equal to 0, or that v2 is equal to v3, which is equal to t. That's what that second equation tells us. And then the third equation tells us, or the top equation tells us, v1 times 1. So v1 plus 0 times v2 plus 2 times v3 plus 2 times v3 is equal to 0. Or v1 is equal to minus 2v3, which is equal to minus 2 times t. So the eigenspace that corresponds to lambda is equal to minus 3 is equal to the set of all the vectors, v1, v2, and v3, where, well, it's equal to t times v3 is just t. That was v3 was just t. v2 also just ends up being t. So 1 times t. And v1 is minus 2 times t. Minus 2 times t. For t is any real number. Or another way to say it is that the eigenspace for lambda is equal to minus 3 is equal to the span. I wrote this really messy. For lambda is equal to minus 3 is equal to the span of the vector minus 2, 1, and 1. Just like that. And it looks interesting, because if you take this guy and dot it with either of these guys, I think you get 0. Is that definitely the case? If you take minus 2 times 1 half, you get a minus 1 there. And then you have a plus 1, that's 0. And then minus 2 times 1 half. Yeah, you dot with either of these guys, you get 0. So this line is orthogonal to that plane. Very interesting. So let's just graph it just so we have a good visualization of what we're doing. So we had that 3 by 3 matrix A. It represents some transformation in R3. And it has two eigenvalues, and each of those have a corresponding eigenspace. So the eigenspace that corresponds to the eigenvalue 3 is a plane in R3. So this is the eigenspace for lambda is equal to 3. And it's the span of these two vectors right there. So if I draw, maybe they're like that, just like that. And then the eigenspace for lambda is equal to minus 3 is a line. It's a line that's perpendicular to this plane. It's a line like that. It's the span of this guy. Maybe if I draw that vector, that vector might look something like this. It's the span of that guy. And this right here is the eigenspace for lambda is equal to minus 3. So what that tells us, just to make sure we are interpreting our eigenvalues and eigenspaces correctly, is look, you give me any eigenvector in this. You give me any vector right here. Let's say that is vector x. If I apply the transformation, if I multiply it by A, I'm going to have 3 times that, because it's in the eigenspace for lambda is equal to 3. So if I were to apply A times x, A times x would be just 3 times that. So that would be A times x. That's what it tells me. This would be true for any of these guys. If this was x, you took A times x, it's going to be 3 times as long. Now these guys over here, if you have some vector in this eigenspace that corresponds to lambda is equal to 3, and you apply the transformation, let's say that this is x right there, if you took the transformation of x, it's going to make it 3 times longer and in the opposite direction. So it's going to go down like this, and that would be A times x. It would be the same, it would be 3 times its length, but in the opposite direction, because it corresponds to lambda is equal to minus 3. So anyway, we've, I think, made a great achievement. We've not only figured out the eigenvalues for a 3 by 3 matrix, we now have figured out all of the eigenvectors, which are, you know, there's an infinite number, but they represent two eigenspaces that correspond to those two eigenvalues, or minus 3 and 3. See you in the next video.
