Let's say that this right over here is the graph of lower case f of x. That's lower case f of x there. And let's say that we have some other function capital F of x. And if you were to take its derivative, so capital F prime of x, that's equal to lower case f of x. Lower case f of x. So given that, which of these could be the graph of capital F of x? And I encourage you to pause this video and try to think about it on your own before we work through it. Well, if this curve is going to be the derivative of one of them, that means that for any x value, it's describing what the instantaneous rate of change, or what the slope of the tangent line is, of whichever one of these is the possible capital F of x. So let's just look at a couple of things about here. So what do we know about lower case f of x? What do we know which is the derivative of one of these? Well, one thing we know is it's always positive. It has, as we go to negative infinity, it asymptotes towards 0. But it's always positive. So since this is describing the slope of one of these, that means that the slope of one of these, or out of the candidates, has to always be positive. And if we look at this, the slope of the tangent line here is indeed always positive. The slope of the tangent line here does look like it's positive. Every time we increase an x, we're increasing by y. Here it's positive. But here it's negative. When we increase by x, we decrease by y. So we can rule this one out. Now, what else do we know? Well, this is the derivative. This is telling us the slope of the tangent line. For example, when x is equal to negative 4, f of negative 4 is pretty close to 0. So that tells us that the slope of the tangent line of capital F of x has to be pretty close to 0 when x is equal to negative 4. So let's see. When x is equal to negative 4 here, this slope, the slope of the tangent line here, isn't close to 0. This actually looks closer to 1. So we could rule this one out. Over here, when x is equal to negative 4, the slope of the tangent line, yeah, that actually does look pretty close to 0. So I won't rule that one out. And over here, the slope of the tangent line, when x is equal to negative 4, that also looks pretty close to 0. So these are still both in the running. So let's see how we can think of a difference. So let's just pick another point. When x is equal to 0, f of 0 looks like it's pretty close to 1. I don't know if it's exactly to 1. Actually, it looks almost exactly equal to 1. So at capital F of 0, the slope of the tangent line needs to be pretty close to 1. So over here, the slope of the tangent line, when x is equal to 0, that looks smaller than 1. So this slope is definitely not 1. While over here, when x is equal to 0, the slope of the tangent line does look pretty close to 1. So this right over here looks like the best candidate for capital F of x. That one right over there. That is capital F of x. And you might see, hey, these look very similar to each other. In fact, they look almost, or actually they do look identical. And you might remember from what you knew about differentiation. Actually, these both look like the basic exponential function. Where I didn't ask you to figure out what the actual function was, just what the possible antiderivative of this function would be. This is the derivative. Lowercase f is the derivative of capital F. Or you could say that capital F is an antiderivative of lowercase f. And when you just inspect this, this looks like the function, both of these functions are e to the x. Because the derivative of e to the x is e to the x.
