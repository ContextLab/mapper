- [Speaker] Wordsmiths all aboard. Train to vocabulary city,
making stops of prefixed gardens and Grand Root Central. Chew, chew! What we're gonna do in this
video is break some words down into parts so you can recognize
those parts in other words. The words we're working on
in this video are adapt, collaborate, and criticize. I'll give you some definitions and then we'll break these words down. Adapt is a verb that means
to change your behavior or ideas in response to a new situation or to change something, to
use it in a different way. There's also the noun form
adaptation, which is the process of changing, or when you
make a book into a movie, that's another kind of adaptation. You're changing a story from one medium to another.
To collaborate, another verb with someone is
to work together with them and to criticize something is to judge something's
qualities, whether good or bad, or to point out flaws. Okay, back to adapt for word parts time. Adapt has two parts we
wanna pay attention to. There's our old friend
add, which means on or to, and then there's this other
part apt from the Latin aptare, meaning to join, to fit. So something that is adapted is fit for some new purpose changed
to join up with something. Let's look at some other English
words that use this route. We use the English word apt
just on its own APT like that to mean appropriate like this
tuxedo is apt for the occasion of a fancy dinner party. Aptitude is being good at something, having abilities appropriate
for the situation. Inapt meaning not apt, not appropriate, as in these athletic
shorts are inapt clothing for this fancy dinner party
as opposed to the tuxedo. Our second word, collaborate. We've got that col prefix here. It's actually from col or
con, meaning with or together. And then lab meaning work. The N becomes an L, right? So it goes from being con,
elaborate to collaborate. Prefixes can change.
They can. They can adapt when they come
before certain consonants. We call this assimilation, becoming to. Finally, criticize. The root crit comes from
the Greek krinein meaning to judge to separate. For our purposes today, I'm
much more interested in eyes. The suffix it means to do
it is a verb forming suffix. You add the verb forming
suffix eyes to critic, and you get what the critic does. Something worth pointing out, especially as you start reading older books or texts written outside the United States or Canada, is that American
and Canadian English spell this suffix with a Z. Or if you prefer a Z, and in other places where
English is an official language, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
India, Kenya, Australia, or New Zealand, for example,
they spell it with an S. It's not pronounced any differently and it's not a spelling error. It's just a difference
between English in one part of the world and English in
another part of the world. Alright, let's use these
words in some sentences. Preston Hazelnut adapted
his novel, "River of Bugs" into the film Beetle Creek. Hazelnut has changed
his book into a movie. He's changed the story to
use it in a different way. As a film, he collaborated with
screenwriter Leslie Gumption to write the screenplay. Hazelnut and Gumption collaborated. They worked together to
adapt the book into a movie. A screenplay is another word for script for the script of a movie. Femi Barnes a a film reviewer,
criticized Beetle Creek for using computer-generated insects instead of trained bugs
in its battle scenes. Barnes didn't like that the
filmmakers didn't use real bugs in the big bug battle, in the big Beatle battle movie. He called out the film for
using fake animated bugs that someone designed on a computer. He a critic, criticized it. He said that bit of the big
Beatle battle movie was bad. I should probably say
here to be responsible that Beetle Creek doesn't exist. It's a thing I made up, but now I kind of want it to be real. Alright, I'll see you in the next one. You can learn anything, David out.
