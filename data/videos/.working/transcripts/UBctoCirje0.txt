Let f of x be equal to 1 half x to the third plus three x minus four. Let h be the inverse of f. Notice that f of negative two is equal to negative 14. And then they're asking us, what is h prime of negative 14? And if you're not familiar with how functions and their derivatives relate to their inverses and the derivatives of the inverse, well this will seem like a very hard thing to do. Because if you were tempted to take the inverse of f to figure out what h is, well it's tough to find, to figure out the inverse of a third degree polynomial defined function like this. So the key, I guess property to realize, or the key truth to realize, is that if f and h are inverses, then h prime of x, h prime of x is going to be equal to, it's going to be equal to one over f prime of h of x. One over f prime of h of x. And you could now use this in order to figure out what h prime of negative 14 is. Now I know what some of you are thinking because it's exactly what I would be thinking if someone just sprung this on me, is where does this come from? And I would tell you this comes straight out of the chain rule. We know that if a function and its inverse, we know that if we have a function and its inverse, that f of the inverse of our function, so f of h of x, f of h of x, we know that this is going to be equal to x. This literally, this comes out of them being each other's inverses. We could have also said h of f of x will also be equal to x. Remember, f is going to map, or h is going to map from some x to h of x, and then f is going to map back to that original x. That's what inverses do. That's because they are inverses. This is by definition. This is what inverses do to each other. But then if you took the derivative of both sides of this, what would you get? Let me do that. So if you take the derivative of both sides of this, d dx on the left-hand side, d dx on the right-hand side, and I think you see where this is going. You're essentially going to get a version of that. The left-hand side, use the chain rule. You're going to get f prime of h of x, f prime of h of x, times h prime of x, comes straight out of the chain rule, is equal to, is equal to, the derivative of x is just going to be equal to one. And then you divide both sides by f prime of h of x, and you get our original property there. So now with that out of the way, let's just actually apply this. So we want to evaluate h prime of 14, or sorry, h prime of negative 14, is going to be equal to one over f prime of h of negative 14. H of negative 14. Now have they given us h of negative 14? Well they didn't give it to us explicitly, but we have to remember that f and h are inverses of each other. So if f of negative two is negative 14, well h is going to go from the other way around. If you input negative 14 into h, you're going to get negative two. So h of negative 14, well this is going to be equal to negative two. Once again, they are inverses of each other. So h of negative 14 is equal to negative negative two. And once again, I just swapped these two around. That's what the inverse function will do. If you're mapping from, if f goes from negative two to negative 14, h is going to go from negative 14 back to negative two. So now we want to evaluate f prime of negative two. Well let's figure out what f prime of x is. So f prime of x is equal to, see we're just going to leverage the power rule. So three times one half is three halves times x to the three minus one power, which is just the second power, plus the derivative of three x with respect to x, well that's just going to be three. And you could view that as just the power rule. This was x to the first power, one times three, x to the zeroth power, well x to the zeroth is just one, so you just left with three. And the derivative of a constant, that's just going to be zero. So that's f prime of x. So f prime of negative two is going to be three halves times negative two squared is four, positive four. So plus three. So this is going to be equal to two times three plus three. So six plus three is equal to nine. So this denominator right here is going to be equal to nine. So this whole thing is equal to one over nine. So this involved, this isn't something you're going to see every day. This isn't a typical problem in your calculus class, but it's interesting.
