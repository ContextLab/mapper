Let's now think about different ways to represent a mixed number. And let's say that our mixed number is 2 and 1 eighth. Actually, let's make it a little bit more interesting. Let's make it 2 and 1 fourth. So let's first think about the whole number part, the 2. Well, the 2 is going to be, the 2 is literally two holes. You could literally view that if you want. So right here, we've drawn each hole. We've cut it up into sections of 8. So it literally is 8 eighths. So let me just do it like this. So the 2 is this whole region right over here. That's 1. So this right over here is 1. And then this right over here is 2. Two holes. Let me paint that in. So that is two holes. And then I have 1 fourth. So this last piece, this last hole, is divided into eight sections. So let me divide it into fourths first. So that's 1 fourth, 2 fourths, and 3 fourths. So we want one of those four to be filled in. One of those four in orange. So one of those four to be filled in. So just like that. You might notice that I filled in two of the eights. And that's because 1 fourth and 2 eights is the same thing. So there, I've represented this mixed number, 2 and 1 fourth. Let's see how we can decompose this. So let's get our grids back. So how else could we do it? And I'm just going to throw a bunch of fractions up there and see what I get. So the first thing I'm going to throw out is 1 half. So let's say that I want to throw out 1 half. So how would I represent 1 half here? Well, if I take one of these holes and I put it into two sections right over here, a half would be this section right over there. So let me color that in. So we have a half. So I'm first going to add a half, which is the same thing as 4 eights. And you see that I just filled in 4 out of the 8 sections, which is exactly half of this first hole. So we're making some progress. Now let's throw in. Now let's throw in, I don't know, let's throw in 3 eights. So what would 3 eights look like? Well, 3 eights, that's going to be, each of these boxes are literally an eighth. And I could fill it in however I want. But let me just put, this is 1, 2, and 3. And then let's fill in plus another 8 eights. Now what's 8 eights? Well, 8 eights is a hole. And I'll do that over here. I still haven't filled this one in yet, but I'll fill in this one right over here. So let's do that. So 8 eights, so that's 1 eighth, 2 eights, 3 eights, 4 eights, 5 eights, 6 eights, 7 eights, and 8 eights. And it's a hole. So I have a hole hole here. So that's 8 eights. I want to make this one a hole, because I want to get to 2. So let me put in a 1 eighth there. So plus 1 eighth. So plus 1 eighth. Well, that's going to be this one right over here. So that's my 1 eighth. And then let's add another, I don't know, let's add another 2 eights. Plus another 2 eights. Plus 2 eights. Well, this is an eights right over here. So 2 eights is going to be 2 of these. And notice, you see that the 2 eights is the same thing as 1 fourth. If you took each of these, if you took this 1 fourth and split it into 2, so you have 2 times as many pieces, it becomes 2 eights. And you see that. If 1 times 2 is 2, 4 times 2 is 8. So that 1 fourth is the same thing as 2 eights. You see the 8 eights is the same thing as a hole. And you see you can make another hole out of 1 half plus 3 eights plus 1 eighth. And they add up to a hole. And just to make sense of why that worked, this is 1 half could be written. 1 half is the same thing as 4 eights. Because you see that we filled in the 4 eights. Then you have 3 eights. And then you have 1 eighth. And if you add all of these together, 4 eights plus 3 eights plus 1 eighth, you are going to get in terms of eights, 4 eights plus 3 eights plus 1 eighth is going to be 8 eights. 4 plus 3 plus 1 is 8. So you get 8 eights, which is this entire hole. So hopefully that helps give you a visual understanding of what we're doing when we're adding and decomposing these fractions a little bit more.
