In the last video, where we assumed a floating exchange rate, we saw how a trade imbalance could lead to the exchange rate changing and how that could resolve the trade imbalance. In the last situation, at a 6 yuan per dollar exchange rate, we had this Chinese manufacturer having $50 million of revenue in the United States that he needed to convert into yuan. So that was the supply of dollars. We had the US manufacturer selling 120 million yuan worth of software in China that he had to convert into $20 million. So that was the demand for dollars. Since the demand for dollars was so much less than the supply of dollars, the price of the dollar went down in terms of yuan. So the yuan became stronger and the dollar became weaker. So instead of having 6 yuan per dollar, maybe it would be 5 yuan per dollar or 4 yuan per dollar. And so eventually, if that happened, the Chinese manufacturer would have to raise its prices in the United States, which would lower its demand. And the US manufacturer could lower its prices in China, which would increase its demand. And that would eventually resolve the trade imbalance. But let's say that the People's Bank of China does not like this situation. It wants to keep the trade imbalance. And so it figures out that the only way to keep the trade imbalance is to keep its currency pegged at 6 yuan per $1. How does it go about doing that? Well, it just has to resolve the imbalance in supply and demand for the US dollar at this exchange rate. So how does it do that? In this situation, there was a supply of $50 million. There was only a demand for $20 million. There was only a demand for $20 million of yuan being converted into dollars. So essentially, what the Chinese Central Bank can do is make up the difference. It can literally just print 180 million yuan and say, I want to convert that into dollars. And then it tries to convert that to dollars. Well, 180 million yuan, if you divide it by 6 at that exchange rate, that would create an incremental demand for $30 million more US dollars. Now, how is the supply and demand equation? The supply is $50 million US dollars. The demand is $20 million US dollars from the American manufacturer. And now another $30 million US dollars from the Chinese Central Bank. So now it's equal. So now the exchange rates actually won't move relative to each other. And the trade imbalance can go on.
