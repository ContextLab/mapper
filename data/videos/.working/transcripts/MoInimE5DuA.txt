I'm Lynn Mack and I'm a math teacher. I've been for years and years, over 30 years. I wasn't aware of Khan Academy until my son, who was a freshman at Clemson University in South Carolina, came in one day and said, Mom, you really need to be using Khan Academy. And he said, here's the TED Talk on it. He's a believer in that. And I listened to it and I said, yeah, you're right. I do. So that was about two years ago when you were relatively new. And I introduced it at our community college and we've been using it a lot. We actually have it on all our websites and we really push it out as a way to help the students in all the math classes. Students say they really like it. They're using it in calculus. They're using it, especially in college, Algern College Trig, where we have a high attrition rate. And we're really trying to get them to use it more before they come to class. And because we really don't, we haven't, there's no need for us to go out there and produce what you already have. That's the point we're trying to get across. And now we're trying to use problem-based learning, but have them view the video before they come to class and help them more that way. We're not having to reteach, for instance, the differential equations when you're doing the limit, the idea of a limit and the slope. I mean, it's a wonderful topic, but kids really take a long time to catch that. So they really need to hear it over and over again and at their own pace. I think that's the biggest thing is customizing learning where they can learn at their own pace. Some kids get it right away and that intimidates other kids when they don't. And then they stop. This way they can privately increase their ability and their confidence level with something before they come to class.
