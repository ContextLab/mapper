We are asked which answer choice describes the number. And I'm not going to say it because that might be a hit this number right over here. So pause this video and have a go at that before we do this together. Okay, now let's do this together. There's a couple of ways we could do it. We could try to express this number in words or we could look at these words here and express them as a number and see which one matches up. Well, I'm gonna go the second way because they're saying things in not always the most standard way. I have 1400s here and you normally wouldn't say, well, sometimes you might say it that way, but let's just try to break it out here. So if I have 14,000s, as this choice says, that would be 14 and then 1000s, and then two that I'm adding seven 10s. So seven 10s is what? Well, it's seven in the 10s place and zero ones or another way to think about it, it's 70. So if I took 14,000 plus 70, what is it going to be? And I could do this here if I wanna line up the place values, 14,070. Well, I have no ones, I have seven 10s, I have no hundreds, I have four thousands and I have one 10,000. I have 14,070, which is exactly the number that they have over here. So we luckily stumbled on that or we looked at choice A and it was actually the choice that describes this number. But let's look at the other ones and see why that doesn't make sense. The second choice here still has the 14,000s, so it still has this part right over here, but they say seven ones. So if you were to add 14,000 and then have seven ones, you'd get 14,000 and then you would add those seven ones in the ones place, so you would get that. And then the last one, the sum of 1400s and seven 10s. Well, they have the seven 10s part, which we already said is the same thing as 70. But what does 1400 look like? Well, 1400, let me do this in a new color, maybe purple. 1400, that is, one way to think about it is you could go to the, let's look at our place value here. If this is ones, this is 10s, this is hundreds, you could say you have 14 of these hundreds. Or another way to think about it is you have 400s and a 10 hundred, or another way of saying a 10 hundred is a thousand. That's the thousands place. So 1400 looks like this. So if you were to add 1470, you would get 1,470, not what they originally asked us about. So we can feel very good about choice A.
