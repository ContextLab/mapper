Write a binomial to express the difference between the area of a rectangle with length p and width 2r and the area of a circle with diameter 4r. And it tells us that p is greater than 4r. So the first thing that might be a little confusing, say, write a binomial. Like, what's a binomial? All a binomial is is an expression with two terms. And really, just to do this, you pretty much have to write a binomial. I'll show you what that's all about. So they want us to express the difference between, I'll color code this, between in pink, the area of a rectangle with length p and width 2r and the area of a circle with diameter 4r. So let's think about each of these independently. So we have the area of a rectangle first. So the area of a rectangle, let's say that is our rectangle. And it has a length p and width 2r. So length p with 2r. So we know the area of a rectangle is going to be the length times the width. So the area here is going to be p times 2r. We could say 2r, 2rp. That is the area of the rectangle. Let's think about the area of the circle with diameter 4r. So let me draw a circle here. It's our circle. The diameter of the circle is 4r. And we know that the area of a circle is 4pi times the radius squared. Oh, actually I almost made a mistake. The diameter is 4r, not the radius. Let me be very clear. Diameter 4r. So diameter is 2 radiuses. This whole thing, this whole distance, I almost made a blunder, this whole distance is 4r. The diameter is 4r. So the radius is going to be half that. The radius is going to be 2r. The radius is going to be 2r. And we know that the area of a circle is pi times the radius squared. In this case, the radius is 2r. Pi times 2r squared, which is equal to pi times 4r squared, right? 2 squared times r squared. Or we could just say that's 4pi r squared. Now, they want us to write a binomial to express the difference between this thing, the difference between the area of the rectangle and the area of the circle and this thing right over here. So what's the difference? Well, it's going to be this thing minus that thing. So it's going to be 2r p minus, I'll do, since I underline difference in orange, I'll put the minus in orange as well, minus 4pi r squared. And we're done. This is a binomial. We have two terms here. That's why it's binomial. If there are three terms, it would be trinomial. If there was kind of an arbitrary number of terms, but more than one, you'd call it a polynomial. If you only have one term here, you call it a monomial. So we are done.
