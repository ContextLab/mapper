So let's just start with polar coordinates. So let's say I have the coordinates. So our radius is seven and our angle in radians is three pi over five. Pause the video and see if you can convert that into rectangular coordinates. Well, the key here is to recognize that x is going to be equal to r cosine of theta and y is going to be equal to r sine of theta. So in this situation, our x coordinate, I could write it like this, it's going to be seven times cosine of three pi over five. Three pi over five. And then our y coordinate is going to be seven times sine of three pi over five. Now this is correct, but if we actually wanted to approximate what numbers these are, we could put them into our calculator. So here we have our calculator. Let's make sure we're in radian mode. Yep, we are in radian mode. And so if you were to take three times pi divided by five, that's that, times cosine, not times cosine, we're taking the cosine of it, times seven, seven is equal to, all around to three decimal places. So negative 2.163 approximately. So this is, that right over there is approximately negative 2.163. And then if we were to do the same thing for the y value, we would take once again, three times pi divided by five is equal to, take the sine of that and then multiply that times seven. That's approximately 6.657. So this is approximately 6.657. Now let's look at an example where we go the other way. And let's do this one in degrees. So let's say I was given the rectangular coordinates. Let's say I'm given the rectangular coordinates negative two comma 11. Pause this video and try to write that as polar coordinates. Well, in other videos, we have seen that r is going to be equal to the square root of x squared plus y squared. This comes straight out of the Pythagorean theorem. And theta, theta is going to be equal to the inverse tan of y over x. Now we have to be careful here because the inverse tan, let me give you an example here. The inverse tangent, actually we'll do it, we'll see it when we do this example. If you just take the inverse tangent, if we're thinking in degrees, it's gonna give you an angle between negative 90 degrees and positive 90 degrees. But we might have, so something in the first or fourth quadrant. But what about when the angle is in the second or third quadrant? So we have to think about that and we might be in a situation where we wanna add 180 degrees to it. So maybe we could say write plus k times 180 degrees where k is one or zero. So maybe that, yeah, that's a reasonable way to say it. But another way to think about it is we might add so plus 180 degrees, I'll put in parentheses here, where we're gonna have to think about where our angle is. So let's start with r, that's pretty straightforward. R is going to be equal to the square root of negative two squared is four, 11 squared is 121. So it's equal to the square root of 125. And now let's think about the inverse tangent. So if I were to just take, let's think about what quadrant we're in. So this is our x-axis, that's our y-axis, we're at negative 211. So negative 211, I could think about being right over there. So that's in the third quadrant. So our r is going to look like this. And this is our angle, this is our angle right over here. That's the theta we wanna solve for. But if we take the inverse tangent of y over x, it's actually going to give us, it's actually going to give us, it's actually going to give us this theta. Maybe I'll call that theta prime. So what we wanna do in this situation is whatever, when I take the inverse tan of y over x, I wanna add 180 degrees to it to get to our actual theta. So in this situation, theta is going to be equal to the inverse tangent of y over x. So that's negative 11 over two or 11 over negative two, which is negative 11 halves, and then plus 180 degrees, if we are doing this all in degrees. So let's get our calculator out. So that first part, we could just straight up take the square root of 125. So it's roughly 11.1, I'll go to three decimal places again, 11.180, I'll just do 11.18. So this is approximately 11.18. And then the angle, let's make sure that we are in degrees because we wanna do this one in degrees. We could have done it in radians, in which case we wouldn't be adding 180 degrees, we'd be adding pi if we were doing it in radians. But let's now, whoops, I'm trying to clear this out. All right, I wanna take 11 divided by two. Well, that could have done that in my head. And then I wanna take the negative of that. And then I wanna take the inverse tangent. I don't see tangent, I have to press second here and I have inverse tangent of that. And notice, it gave me the angle of negative 79 point, whatever, whatever degrees. I have to add 180 degrees to get to my actual angle. So plus 180 is equal to 180 degrees. Roughly 100 point three degrees. So theta is approximately 100 point three degrees. If I were to add it in polar coordinates, that leads to approximations, it's 11 point one eight comma 100 point three degrees. And I'm done.
