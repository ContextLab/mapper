All right, good morning. Great. Good morning, everyone. So welcome back to our summer learning series with Khan Academy for New Hampshire educators. Just a reminder that this is part of our summer learning path because we are working to enroll all of you into our partnership for back to school. That includes Khan MeeGo, the district partnership. And if you use MAP growth and clever learning paths, and that is going to be our last session next Tuesday, but today, we are going to learn from Sarah Robinson around writing coach. And I just want to remind you who we are again, Danielle Sullivan, senior regional manager, Northeast district partnership, Barbara Campbell, your district success manager and Crystal Hercules. Actually, she was starting, but we actually have a new PL person is going to be joining us in New Hampshire. So after Sarah shares today, I'll just remind everyone, if you haven't signed up for a partnership yet, how you can do so. So I'm going to go ahead and stop sharing my screen and hand it over to Sarah. Everyone, thank you for welcoming me. I'm going to be sharing my screen now. All right. Can you all see Khan MeeGo writing coach? Okay, great. Um, thank you for welcoming me Danielle, I'm really excited to be here. As Danielle said, I'm Sarah Robertson, I am the senior product manager at Khan Academy for literacy and classroom experiences. I'm also a former middle school ELA and humanities teacher in New England, I taught in Boston for six years. And I was a curriculum writer and a teacher instructional trainer. And, you know, when I was teaching, I think one of the things that really stuck out to me as the teacher in Boston specifically was, you know, not only did I have many, many students who were reading and writing below grade level, but I had about 100 students that I was responsible for each year. I don't know, you know, kind of what the student teacher ratios are, where you all are. But being an ELA teacher in Boston meant that, you know, every time I assigned one essay to my students, I had about, you know, 100 drafts, single drafts to give feedback on I had 100 students to support through all stages of the writing process. And I think I counted in one school year, I had to give feedback on 2500 essays for a single school year. And when I was teaching ELA, I worked 12 hours a day, nearly every weekend, I still felt like I could never get to all the students in my class who needed help. I could never keep a close enough eye on the students who really needed my help the most because they often weren't the ones asking for it. I couldn't get feedback to my students quickly enough as far as I tried. And I never really knew like, at any given moment exactly where my students stood. And I was very burnt out. I loved it, but I was very burnt out. And this was before COVID learning loss, this was before generative AI and its impact on ELA teachers. So I have a lot of empathy for teachers today. And I did a little dive into, you know, because I'm now representing teachers who are ELA teachers in 2024, and I haven't been in the classroom for a while now. I often hang around in these, you know, ELA teacher Facebook groups just to see what teachers are talking about. And on the right side here, you can see some just recent quotes from teachers who have been just talking about how hard it is specifically to teach writing in 2024. You have teachers talking about kids, you know, in sixth grade not being able to write a single paragraph. Teachers saying like they do not know how to get grading back on time. It's extremely overwhelming. How do English teachers assign essays at all? And then on our side, OnCon Academy, we interview teachers and we co create with teachers constantly. And some things that we've heard just recently are, you know, with writing, it's just so hard. I've heard that more than once. It's just so hard. And on top of that, we had teachers talk about this new need of like wanting and needing proof that a student wrote what they said that they wrote. And so I think just in the past couple of years, what we've seen in addition to just the overwhelm that teachers already had is how hard AI has made their jobs. Here's a couple of my favorite quotes here. I've seen several AI checkers online, you're seeing how accurate would you say those are? They're not. It's true. And another one just says I hate AI. And this one, you know, it's, it's going to drive me out of education. So this is clearly a new issue that I personally didn't experience when I was a teacher, that I think we all need to be paying attention to. And, um, at Khan Academy, I think, you know, we are all very well known, of course, for being a wonderful STEM resource for teachers. But our mission has always been to provide a free world class education to anyone anywhere. And so we've had this long standing desire to put out humanities content to help ELA teachers to put out reading and writing resources. But, you know, as somebody who developed another ed tech product for ELA in the past, I know how hard it can be to do that, because you need to worry about content, you need to figure out how do you integrate this, you know, into the teachers routines, specifically for ELA can be really challenging. So when we partnered with open AI in late 2022, immediately we saw the ways that it could actually, instead of continuing to hurt ELA teachers lives, it can actually help them and it could help students too. So, you know, we started thinking about, you know, what do we know about writing, and we know that students obviously are expected to be grade level standards, they are supposed to be writing 60 minutes per day, if you can believe that. They need support, not just with feedback part, they need support through the whole writing process from the very beginning of getting that essay prompt. And if they're going to grow their writing skills, then the feedback that they receive needs to be specific, needs to be actionable, it needs to be personalized, and it needs to be timely. And without that, it is very hard for students to improve their writing skills. But in reality, what we see, and I'm sure you all are very familiar with these stats, only about a quarter of students meet grade level writing standards. And this data is from before the pandemic. Less than 10% are actually writing 60 minutes a day. And it is basically impossible for one teacher with the number of students that they have to support every student throughout the entire writing process, and give feedback in a timely manner. If you are grading, you know, giving feedback on 100 essays as a teacher, because you have 100 students, then, and you're limiting yourself, I used to do this, I would set a timer on my iPhone, 10 minutes per kid, that's it, like I would mark up their paper, fill out a very rough rubric, 10 minutes per kid, 17 hours for one essay draft. It is impossible. It is impossible. So when we decided to start thinking about this as a problem that we wanted to try to solve at Khan Academy, the first thing that we did in January 2023 was come up with the concept, right? We developed a prototype. It was part of an internal hackathon. And people immediately saw the power of something like this. I think one of our lead developers was like, I'm not a strong writer. I've never been a strong writer. I'm a math guy. I learned how to write a thesis statement. I didn't even know what a thesis statement was. And you're all like, good job, buddy. It was it was like really inspiring to see the power of what this tool could do. So from there, we started building out more we launched our college admissions essay activities. Those have been pretty popular. There's a good feedback on my admissions essay and a help me brainstorm and admissions essay activity. And then in November of last year, we launched our essay feedback activity. And this was exciting because students could provide their first draft. And the AI would generate really, really high quality feedback and provide revision support on that first draft. And I'll show you a little bit more about how teachers and students responded to that later on. But from there, it became really clear, you know, we want to keep building out backwards from the creation of the first draft and the submitting that for feedback, we want to build it back to before the student creates that first draft. So that led us to July last month when we launched the student experience of writing coach, which is now available in KineMigo. And next month, we are gearing up for the teacher experience launch of writing coach. And I'm going to give you a full preview and demo of that in a moment. So that is kind of how we ended up where we are. And so when we launched essay feedback, we got a lot of positive feedback, we had teachers say that they were blown away with the quality of the feedback, it gave feedback that matched what they would have provided. This is something we heard over and over again, they couldn't believe that the feedback KineMigo provided was remarkably similar and sometimes more comprehensive than what they would have given the student. We had a student from Florida who does IB essay perhaps say that this was the most this tool made the most significant difference in helping their students grow than they've ever seen. And then there was one teacher in Ohio who used essay feedback consistently. And every student was the only teacher who every single one of her students passed the state writing assessment. So we have a lot of positive feedback about this particular first version of this this feedback and revision activity. But when we went into schools, we did a whole kind of listening tour in Indiana specifically. And something that a lot of teachers said was, yes, we love essay feedback. But I still have a large number of students and non insignificant number of students who cannot get that first draft. They cannot like they struggle to produce one draft to submit for feedback. So like this is great for the kids who can do that. But for the many students I have who just cannot for whatever reason put pen to paper don't really understand they feel paralyzed. They feel like they just can't do it. We need something that does a little bit more. So that's where writing coach evolves into writing coach. And writing coach obviously has not been out in front of students yet because the school here hasn't started and we just launched it. But in our user tests, these were some of the things that teachers said when we demoed it for them and gave them a full kind of tour. And the purpose of this was to get their feedback on how we could make writing coach better. But by and large, they had very, very positive things to say. This is the answer to all of our dreams. As bright as my day and year, teachers were chomping at the bit to get access to this as soon as possible. So before I dive in to what writing coach is and how it looks, at a very high level, I'll actually start right to the left here. And I'll say what writing coach is not because you probably have been bombarded or you've heard about many different writing tools and writing solutions that are out there. I'm familiar with most of them. And it's not just a digital essay writing platform. We do have we do do those things, but that's not what it is. It's not an evaluative or grading tool for teachers. That isn't even something that I think we're considering building out. I don't really want to build a solution where students are producing essays with an AI, they get feedback from the AI, the AI grades it and then they're done. I think writing is a human practice and a human activity. And I think there should be humans involved in that. And that means that there is a teacher at the end of the day, reading students writing students are sharing their writing with their peers, but it's not 100% on the teacher for everything. It's not a productivity tool for students. So there's many AI writing tools out there. And the goal of them is to produce better writing. Our tool produces better writers. It's also not just a feedback generator or a tool that provides kind of easy to accept suggestions for improving grammar and mechanics. I'm a big grammarly user. I love grammarly, but this is very different from that. It doesn't suggest changes for you to just accept and then move on. It's an instructional tool. So the primary purpose is student learning and teacher transparency. It's designed to guide students through the entire process while preventing cheating. And it is a way for teachers to give students more practice writing, to give them the opportunity to get those 60 minutes in a day, and to give them real time support. So tools like this really allow teachers in science class or history class to take a turn asking students to write. And they don't need to necessarily, you know, hold their hands the whole way through. And kids can still get that feedback and that support that they need. And then of course, it's also data dashboards for teachers. So it has at a glance and in-depth insights into student writing processes. All right, so let's dive into the student experience. Writing coach, I'm going to show you a demo in just a second. With writing coach, students can get support through the entire writing process. So I'm going to show you the very first step, which is understanding the assignment and getting started. Then there's formulating ideas and outlining. Then there's drafting and getting unstuck from drafting if they need it. And then of course, feedback and revising that piece that we had originally had as well with with essay feedback. And I just realized that I haven't pulled up the other prototype just yet for the teacher experience. So I'll make sure I'll do that in a second. But okay. Can you now see, do you see daylight savings time persuasive essay? Yes. Okay, great. So the essay writing process, as you're probably aware, is something that takes more than, you know, 30, 20, 30 minutes. So I'm going to kind of try and give you a sense of what this looks like without, you know, going too deep in the weeds. The very first step of writing coach actually starts with the teacher creating the assignment. So I'm skipping over that part. But a student can also go back and click begin new essay here. And they can actually kind of start their own if they want to. But if the teacher wants that data dashboard, then she can create the assignment herself and fill in the essay information. Okay, so when the student clicks on the assignment, and they get here from their Conmigo learner activities page or from their assignments page, the first thing they do is they see Conmigo here. And Conmigo is explaining that we're going to write this essay. And these are the instructions from the teacher. And in this first step here, what we've done is we've programmed the AI to specifically focus on helping the student break down the prompt and understand the essay requirements. This is not really about necessarily like doing the research or getting evidence or starting the outlining process at all. This is just about making sure you understand what the expectations are before you move forward. So this is why it's really important when we train teachers on how to use Writing Coach, that they are paying specific attention to this essay prompt and instructions. I don't know what the New Hampshire expectations are for, for writing what your specific state rubric looks like. But we have an opportunity in this space to get specific so that Conmigo can make sure it's aligning its feedback and its guidance to your specific expectations in your state. So if there's like a certain way of, you know, formatting an essay, or if there's certain kind of citation that your teachers prefer, or, you know, if there's any kind of guidance like that, if your teacher is providing that in this instructions field, then Conmigo will take that context and it will craft the experience to align to whatever it is that you need. That also works at the teacher by teacher level. So if you have AP US History teachers who are doing DBQs, if you have, you know, IB teachers, I spoke with a teacher just recently who does the Cambridge ACE Writing Program. And if you include that context in here, say this is a persuasive essay aligned to this framework, then Conmigo will take that into context and tailor it to those expectations. So when the student lands here, the ask from the student is just, first of all, do you have any questions about this? And if the student doesn't have any questions to start off, we have these kind of prompts here that they can click on just to kind of get a sense of what they're doing. So you can say, explain the essay type or ask for the requirements. But one of the things that we've seen students do a lot is kind of define terms in these prompts that are sometimes unfamiliar. So if I may not know the word articulate, I can say, what does articulate mean? Oops, what is articulate? Okay, it got it got what I tried to type there. So it defines words for me. It's also noticing, I'm noticing here that it's asking for a rebuttal. And maybe, you know, I don't remember what a rebuttal is. So what is a rebuttal again? And it's going to give me an explanation of that. So when you respond to an opposing argument to show why your position is still strong in your essay, after you present an argument from the other side, you need to explain why your main argument is better. Okay, so what do I do now? All right, let's start by deciding whether you support or oppose daylight savings time. What are your initial thoughts on this topic? Once you have a position, we can move on to gathering evidence and organizing your arguments. So ConMigo is going to push them in the direction of what they should do next. So first, it's asking me, do I have a stance on this? If I don't have a stance, it'll push me to the research. And again, if the teacher has specified, you know, make sure that you do research, make sure you cite textual evidence, ConMigo will remind them to do those things. But if you're writing, you know, an essay where they're kind of just supposed to write about general experience, then it will just kind of brainstorm that with them. So again, this is really important for specifying to ConMigo what you want from the students. So the student can kind of go on with this conversation as long as they need to, but when they are ready to move on, or when ConMigo has sort of recognized that they're good, then they can move on to outlining. In the outlining stage, we worked very closely with teachers here to find a an outlining structure and outlining process that fit the needs of many, many different, you know, kinds of writing and different ways that teachers teach outlining. So the beauty of this is that there really is a lot of flexibility here. So, you know, the default has three body paragraphs, but you can add as many more body paragraphs as you want, you can remove body paragraphs to have fewer. This is just, you know, in Massachusetts, we had an open response that our 7th graders had to do. And that was typically just kind of one body paragraph with a with three evidence inside of it. So it's just it's very kind of different. So you can structure it to work with, you know, however the essay structure, the type of writing assignment that you need. You can remove evidence and sources, you can add reasoning and explanation and remove those as well. And again, ConMigo is always looking at those essay instructions the teacher provided. So if the teacher says you this has to be five paragraphs, or you need to include at least three body paragraphs, or you need to have cited textual evidence, when the student tries to move on to drafting, it's going to check the outline, and it's going to make sure that it's met those expectations. So if you haven't done those things, ConMigo will let you know, and the student will be prompted to kind of finish that work. So I'm going to, I'm gonna actually jump over to this version because I don't want to have you sit through me copying and pasting into all these fields. So I have a filled in version of the outline here on this tab. And one thing I wanted to show you was I at one point had a main point in my third body paragraph. That was the counter argument. And I didn't provide the rebuttal. So my argument here is that daylight savings time shouldn't be observed anymore. In my third body paragraph, my main point was daylight savings time helps save the environment. And I forgot to include the rebuttal. And so I asked ConMigo, can you check my third body paragraph? And it told me you need to, or where is it? The main point suggests that daylight saving time helps save the environment, which seems to be an argument in favor of daylight savings time. Since your thesis against daylight savings time, it should be presented as a counter argument. And then the guidance it gives me is to add a counter argument and rebuttal to the outline so that I can make sure that I'm actually aligned to the point I'm trying to make here. This is something I frequently saw with my seventh graders. They sort of forgot what position they took and would sort of flip flop between paragraphs. So, and again, like at any point, the student is just stuck. If they're just stuck, then they can just click this button or they can say help. And that's often what we see, you know, when we, when we review chat is like, kids are just like, I don't know what to do. I'm stuck. IDK help me. And ConMigo is going to be there. And something we heard from teachers is that, you know, a lot of kids are afraid to raise their hand, they're ashamed to go up to the front of the classroom. And this is it feels a little bit safer for kids who maybe are just too shy, and typically don't ask for that kind of help because they don't want to see be seen as needing help. And so it's just sort of another way to get that input, especially if you know, I remember being as a teacher just buzzing around the room trying to check as many kids as possible. So this is always there for them. They can use it as a resource. So I'm going to move on now to drafting. And let me go back to, well, I think this is fine, actually. So I've already filled in the draft here, because this is a previous essay. But if I hadn't filled in the draft, let me just if I hadn't filled in the draft, obviously, this would be empty. But then you have down here, the outline is the default. So this is the outline I just filled in. And then chat is here. If you need ConMigo, you can open ConMigo again. And it's always there for the student if they need to get help. And then they can also view their assignment instructions if needed. So when they're drafting, let me actually delete this so you can see, this is what they would see if they started here. And what we've done is we've allowed students to copy and paste from their outline into their draft. And again, if they get stuck at any point, they can ask ConMigo for help. So I'm just kind of pasting in here some of the stuff that I had from my outline. I'm going to go to chat and just say I'm stuck. Okay, let's work through this together. It looks like you're at the beginning stages of your draft. Let's start by expanding your introduction. Your introduction should hook the reader, provide some background and state your thesis. You already have a thesis statement. So let's work on the hook and background information. How can you grab the reader's attention? Think about something interesting related to daylight savings time. What can you say to introduce the topic for your thesis? So it's prompting me to go back and fill in my introduction and kind of get that first paragraph out of the way. And then if I were to ask again, it would help me move on. And now I'm just going to say, can you please just write that first intro paragraph for me. It's always scary doing a live demo. Okay, good job. I understand you're feeling stuck, but it's important that you work through this yourself to develop your writing skills. Let's break it down together. ChatGBT would have happily done that for me. So if I actually I'll show you in a moment what I mean, but let's say I am just not feeling like I want to do it myself. I open chat GPT in another tab. I ask it to write, you know, the whole essay for me or an intro paragraph for me. I come in here and I paste it in. It's going to seem all hunky dory for me on the student side until the teacher sees the report and you'll see kind of what happens if a student does that. If you're pasting from your outline as a student into your draft, that's fine. But if you're pasting from somewhere else, that is something that we flag for teachers. Excuse me. Okay, so let me jump back over to let's go. Oh yeah, this is the one that I let me just grab the sample essay so I can move on. Alright, so I'm going to show you now what it looks like to move on to revising and I had actually already submitted this essay so it was very quick but you can see here that Kanigo generated twelve suggestions for this first draft. Those are organized in these five different categories. Introduction, this is about their claim. Do they have a thesis and a claim that's aligned to the actual essay prompt? Have they blushed out their introduction? Does it have enough context, etc. Evidence, that is about the alignment of the evidence to the points they're trying to make. The way that they've argued their evidence, the way that they've chunked their evidence, if they've cited their evidence. Structure is, you know, organization and structure. Conclusion is just the conclusion paragraph. And then style is really about style, tone, vocabulary, the formality of the writing. It's also, you know, where Kanigo will sometimes point out like grammar issues or awkward phrasing. So I'm going to just kind of show you, actually, are any of you familiar with the essay feedback activity? No? Okay, so you haven't seen this before. So in the revising portion, not only is Kanigo generating the feedback, but it's also there as a revising tool. And we're working on something right now actually where we are, instead of just saying chat with Kanigo about the feedback, we're actually breaking out the ways that you can chat with Kanigo because students were like not really understanding why they would chat or what they could do if they chatted. So we're showing them things like give an example of what you mean, explain this suggestion, and check my revision, because what they can do, let's see. Let's see if this one here, this one is talking about how I don't have enough context in my introduction. So in my introduction, I do the classic thing that my seventh graders would do and start it with a question. That was their favorite kind of hook. And then they just write jump right into it's for daylight savings time, daylight savings time shouldn't be observed anymore. So I'm not explaining anything about what daylight savings time is, where it comes from, the history behind it. And Kanigo is pointing that out to me, like our strong essay would sort of give that very quick summary. And now I'm like, okay, what is what do you mean by context? Like, how do I add context? I'm going to say, give me an example. And what it's not going to do is give me the sentence that to provide the context for daylight savings time, what it is going to do is give me an example from a different kind of essay. So in this example, it's about the benefits of recycling. Here's an example of, you know, a week intro for benefits of recycling. Here's a revised one where they're giving an example of how you could provide context on recycling before just plopping in your thesis statement. And from here, excuse me, I could add in a sentence and say daylight savings time, or DST was founded because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like give my background. And after I've done that, I can now go back to Kanmigo and say, is that better? Or did I fix it? Or if I do that straight from, you know, this, this section here, I'll be able to just say check my revision. And then Kanmigo will open the chat and say, Yes, you did it very good job. Or you know, that context really wasn't enough, maybe add a little bit more. And once Kanmigo has kind of assured me that I've addressed the suggestion, I can mark it as resolved. So the student can go through each of the paragraphs review the feedback, we also give some positive feedback too. So there's a mix of praise and kind of actionable critical feedback. But once the student is done resolving all their suggestions, this is a completed one. So I've already marked it as complete, but they click mark is complete. And that allows them then to export the essay because again, the end result of this process is not the student just being like, okay, I wrote an essay and now I'm just going to move along my merry way. We do care about teachers reading students work and what they have to say. That's the entire point of writing is communicating. So we allow students to export their essay to Google Doc in Google Drive, they can save it as a PDF or MS Word. And these are the different ways that we kind of allow students to upload them to an LMS if teachers are going to grade the essay in an LMS. I actually think one of you Yeah, I spoke to I think one of you at a school visit at one point and I think the feedback I got was like, it has to work well with Google classroom, it has to. And that was something that you know, we really took the heart as we heard, okay, we have to figure out ways to make this work really well with Google Classroom. So exporting to Google Drive and Google Docs and allowing teachers to annotate and you know, link it to Google Classroom, and to provide their own feedback into the grading will classroom that was something that we really wanted to prioritize. So thank you to whoever whichever one of you that was. Okay, so let me jump back actually, I'll show you to this is the main student essays page. So for writing coach, again, you get here as a student, just under your economy go activities. And for writing coach, you have this kind of home base to manage the essays that you've written, you can go back and like review your progress, you can jump back into an essay if you were kind of working on multiple ones at the same time. But it will save your progress and you can pick something up because you know, oftentimes essay writing is a multi day process. Okay, so now I have to make sure I open the right tab here. So let me just make sure I get the right one for the teacher experience. And while I'm doing that, actually, I will just show you a quick summary of the teacher experience. So beautiful. That was on the first try. So with with teacher experience and writing coach, again, a large part of how we designed it was focusing on supporting students, how do we create something that is going to be Socratic, it's not going to do the writing for them. It's not, you know, going to just just regurgitate a bunch of of their writing with feedback and then just expect them to do something with it, but it's going to be there through the whole process and help them as they need it without being like too intrusive and annoying. But on top of that, we also thought deeply about what what teachers wanted and what teachers needed. So not only is Kinego allowing is writing coach allowing teachers to get insights into the students' entire writing process. So all of their chat histories, their outline, their draft histories, the feedback they got, their their moderation, if their conversations were moderated, the students' conversations. They also get high level insights. So obviously, we don't want to create more work by saying, okay, teachers, like, here's, you know, 100 different essays, and now you have 100 chat histories to read and 100 outlines to review and 100 of different kinds of feedback and many draft histories to dig through. So we thought about the high level insights. And the point of this is to really present something that before the teacher, you know, begins the process of like, actually reading what kids have to say and doing grading themselves. We wanted to surface for them things that were insightful or useful, and then they can decide, you know, how deep they want to dig into those different processes. So I will show you what that looks like. Can we just pull this tab in here? Okay. All right. So daylight saving sign persuasive essay. This is the teacher's Manage Assignments page. So I'm going to pop on into this insights page for Writing Coach. And again, this is the report that we'll be releasing. It's technically in a couple of weeks, but we've been saying September. So this will be coming in September. And so what I'm showing you right here is more of a prototype than the actual experience. And this is what we're calling the class report for Writing Coach. So when you as a teacher create a Writing Coach assignment, you see all of the students in the class that you assigned it to, you see where they are in their writing process. So I can see if, you know, there's some student who hasn't started or somebody who's really far behind compared to their peers. I know to check in with them. I know to figure out what's going on. I can see when people when the students in the class last modified their essay or their draft or their outline, whatever it is they're working on. I can see their total time spent. And I can see a breakdown of how much time they spent during each of the writing stages. So if I'm just trying to get a sense of like, you know, if a student spent 68 minutes and, you know, most of it was chatting with God ego, and then they spent five minutes drafting, you know, that's that's going to raise a flag for me, that's going to be something I'm going to want to dig into a little bit more. So this really allows teachers to see kind of how is the balance of how that time is being spent? And should I look very closely at the students full history? I see the word count of their latest draft, and then a high level feedback. So if they got, you know, however many suggestions from con ego, how many they resolved, how many they haven't resolved, or if they're completed, and they didn't resolve some feedback, I might be interested in seeing what feedback they chose not to resolve. We also have been these originality flags. And these are what I mentioned earlier. So if the student is drafting in such a way that indicates that maybe they didn't write it themselves, we will raise these little flags. And there's kind of different levels of the flags here. So if the student didn't do anything concerning, you see these this no concerns flag, if they may be pasted, I think it's around 20 words, we're going to be including the guidelines for how the flags get created in this kind of hover over here. But if they if they piece it like a smaller number of words that might raise a yellow flag, but if they paste a larger number of words, or they paste multiple times sections of their draft, or even if they paste, you know, a certain number of words into their thesis, or their main points into their outline, that could also raise a certain kind of flag. And we are also taking note, you know, if they're pasting into their evidence or their source, that's not a concern. That's what we expect them to do. But this is really meant to check for are there things the student is doing that are worth the teacher look taking a closer look at so that the teacher isn't just having to having to go back into Google draft history and manually for every student play that draft back or, you know, look at that version history for every single kid, because that's just too time consuming. So I can then if I really want to dig in, it shows here that the student pasted 522 words from an unknown source into their draft and then during revising as well, I'm going to click on view writing history. And it's going to take me straight to that originality flag. So I can see here, I can open it, it'll show me what they pasted, it will highlight it for me in the students draft, so I can see exactly where they pasted it into. And at the same time, I can see what their chat history was. So here I can see the student also just asked on me to write it for them. And so that's another flag for me. I'm going to definitely check in with this kid and see what happened and why they did this and where did they paste this from? Because this is just not, you know, one chunk of evidence here. And if I am looking at it, and maybe it's a yellow flag, because it's not a very large amount of text. And what I see is that the student pasted maybe some new evidence that they found. And it wasn't from their outline, which is why it was flagged, I can look at it and say, Oh, okay, that was just they found some new evidence. It's in quotation marks. I see they cited it. We're all good. This is fine. And I can kind of dismiss that one. So what this does is it really allows teachers to at a very high level, see where to focus most of their attention. And then when they need to, they can really zoom in and look very closely. And even if you are not as interested, or you know, if originality warnings aren't the main thing that you're looking for here, maybe I have a student who's on an IEP, maybe I have students who I know are really struggling, I can still just go back through their whole process and see maybe where they got tripped up or what they're struggling with the most, because we'll start right here with their final draft. But I can go through understanding I can see did they chat with kind of ego at all? What kind of questions did they ask? And outlining, I can see what their outline looks like. And again, if they asked for any help, or what kind of things they struggled with. And then for drafting, I can see kind of the different chunks of time that they spent typing and, you know, in inserting things from their outline, and then any flags that they got. And then in revising as well, I can see the first draft that they submitted all the feedback that they got, what they resolved and didn't resolve, and even view their chats that they had about the different kinds of feedback. So all of it is here for teachers, it's all transparent, it's all visible to them. But again, the expectation is that the teacher is going through this for all you know, 100 or however many students they have, they're just doing it where they need to. But if they need to, it's here, and they can use it. And we're excited to to continue adding more kinds of insights to this report. One of the things that we're looking at next is ways to generate kind of like a summary of the entire class. So you know, we noticed that most of the students really did well with outlining, there were a few students who really struggled with revising, they really weren't kind of engaging with that as much. Or it seemed like in the writing feedback that was generated, most of the feedback that was given to students was really related to evidence. So that might be a skill that you would want to dig into and producing that as well at the student level. And so we're really excited to have teachers use this, and to continue getting feedback from partners and from teachers and students and to continue just kind of building this out because we really think that this is going to be powerful for teachers who are extremely tired and looking for things that will save them time and help their students improve and allow them to assign more writing without actually increasing that that workload. So one last slide for you, and then I do have, I think, maybe a few minutes for questions. So just in summary, how is writing coach different from some of those other writing solutions you might be familiar with, or might have heard about the focus with writing coaches on the writing process and not just that final draft. It's not just a tool for how to deal with that final draft. It helps students work through that process and it gives teachers insights into that process. It allows for personalized one on one support for students and differentiation, not just in feedback, but from the very beginning from that understanding and breaking down the prompt. It's an instructional tool with the purpose of producing better writers, not a productivity tool or an evaluative tool with the purpose of producing better writing. It produces anti cheat flags and other high level insights for teachers. And again, it allows teachers to assign more writing and to give students more writing practice, not just in English class, but in social studies, science and other domains, while simultaneously reducing burnout by not requiring them to give kids feedback on multiple drafts or to hold their hands all 30 or however many is in a single classroom at a time and it gives them that first layer of feedback to improve their their writing. So with that, I'm happy to answer questions. I've also put my email here. I know Danielle is available to you, but if you have any questions specifically about writing coach, you can reach out to me there. But yeah, I think we're close to time, but I will. I'm happy to take any questions. I'm just flabbergasted. Any good way, I hope. Yes, yes, I I've been going. I think I just missed last week's training, but I've gone to all of these. I'm a director of adult ed for Nashua and I'm wow. That's great. Thank you. You are making a huge difference and I've just got to convince all my teachers to do this. That's that's our goal too. We've really been developing this this part of writing coach. You know we've launched essay feedback in November. It gained a lot of traction in the school year and so we've been developing this year this product over the entire summer and we've been working with teachers on break, but we are so eager for a class of students to begin using it and to start getting their input and working with students and teachers. So yeah, if you do get your teachers to use it, please have them send us feedback. My only question would be in math. We have a competency called communication. So how easily could you import math symbols into this writing? Oh, that is such an interesting question. Actually, in the essay itself, I don't know, but partly you can chat because all of our conmigo chats support math symbols. There's a math input so you can chat about the math. I'd have to try that out and see what happens. It is it is created so that you can do the highlighting and everything like that where the feedback is highlighted. It is sort of meticulously developed to make sure that that works properly because of the way that it constantly gets passed in and out of different AI prompts. So I wonder what that effect would be, but it'd be a very interesting thing to test. Something to look into. Yes, absolutely. I didn't know that that was a standard in New Hampshire. In Nashua, it's one of our standards for math. We have communication, represent, and solve. Once upon a time, if you could get the right answer, they didn't care beyond that. We care beyond that now. That's awesome. Well, you on the call. Jody and I have met yesterday and I told her about the the she was interested in writing coach and I told her about this. So hopefully you got all your questions and more answered. So we'll be back back in touch about that. Yeah, I'm looking forward to for the recording. I'm definitely going to I'm thinking about our first department meeting, playing it, but and then at that point as an intro and then as we get users who are doing it, you know, more kind of in-depth training, maybe with questions that teachers could ask at some point in the early fall. Absolutely. This is you guys have a lot of PL hours so we can definitely definitely do that. Yeah, great. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks so much for this.
