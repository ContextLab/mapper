All right, we're told to identify all of the real and imaginary roots or zeros of the function g of x. So pause this video, have a go at this, and I'll give you a hint. The rational root theorem will be useful. Okay, now let's think about what the rational root theorem tells us. It tells us if this polynomial here does have rational roots, it can be made up based on the factors of the constant term, and we could call the constant term right over here p, and the factors of the coefficient on the highest degree term, which is also a three. Let's call that q. So let's think about the factors of p. So I'm gonna list p factors right over here, and we want the plus or minus version of it. Well, luckily three is a prime number, so it only has two factors. So we could have a positive one, we could have a negative one, we could have a positive three, or we could have a negative three. And similarly, q is also a three, so its factors are the same thing, one, negative one, positive three, and negative three. Now, we wanna test not these numbers, but we wanna test numbers that are made up of the possible p over qs, and both the positives and the negatives of them. So for example, we could first try to take one over one right over here, which is of course going to be equal to one. Now, how can we test whether that is actually a root of g? Well, we can just try to evaluate what g of one is going to be equal to. G of one is going to be equal to three times one to the third, which is just three, plus 11 times one squared, which is just 11, plus five times one, which is just five, minus three. So if I just eyeball it here, these two things cancel out, then I am left with 11 plus five, which is equal to 16. So one is definitely not a zero. If it was, then we would have gotten a zero here, not a 16. So we can rule that one out. So this is not a root. Now let's try negative one, and there's a couple of ways we can get negative one. We could have a negative one p over a one q. You could have a positive one p over a negative one q, or you could even have a negative three p over a three q, or you could have a positive three p over a negative three q. So those are all ways of getting to negative one. And so let's see if that's a root. So g of negative one is going to be equal to three. Negative one to the third power is negative one. So this is going to be negative three, plus negative one squared is one still. So this is still going to be a positive 11. And then plus five times negative one, which is negative five, and then we have minus three. So let's see what happens here. We end up with negative three plus 11 is eight, minus five is three, minus three is equal to zero. So we have found one of our roots. Negative one, x equals negative one is one of our roots. Now, how can we find the other roots? There could be, especially if we're looking at imaginary roots here, there should be three of them. So what we can do, if we know negative one is a root, then that also tells us that x plus one must be a factor. Because if you said x plus one equals zero, then you'd get x equals negative one. And so let's divide x plus one into the rest of this polynomial and start to factor it. So if I take x plus one, and I'm going to do algebraic long division, you could also do synthetic division, but I prefer algebraic long division because it feels a little less mysterious. So x plus one goes into three x to the third, plus 11 x squared, plus five x, minus three. So you just look at the highest degree terms, x goes into three x to the third, it goes three x squared times. So I'll write here in the second degree column, three x squared times. And all I did is I took three x to the third divided by x to get that. Three x squared times x is three x to the third. Three x squared times one is plus three x squared. And this is just like regular long division, has a lot of similarities. Now we subtract this, that cancels with that. And 11 x squared minus three x squared is eight x squared. Bring down the first degree term plus five x. X goes into eight x squared, eight x times. If you just take eight x squared divided by x, you get eight x. So eight x times x is eight x squared, eight x times one is, so we have plus eight x here. We subtract again and we get five x minus eight x is negative three x. And then bring down this constant term minus three. X goes into negative three x, negative three times, negative three times, negative three times x plus one is negative three x, and then minus three. And of course now if you were to subtract this, we get no remainder. That makes sense because we already saw that negative one is a root or that x plus one is a factor. So now we could actually rewrite g of x. G of x is equal to x plus one times this business. Three x squared plus eight x minus three. So now this is a standard quadratic. We can try to factor this or we could use a quadratic formula. I'm gonna use the quadratic formula here. So we remember negative b plus or minus, well let me just write it out here. So this is our a, let me just do another color. This is our a, this is our b, and that is our c. So quadratic formula negative b, so that's negative eight, plus or minus the square root of b squared, so that's eight squared, so it's 64, minus four times a, which is three, times c, which is negative three. So I could put a three here and then make this positive. And then all of that is going to be over two a. So two a is two times three is six. So this is going to be the same thing as negative eight plus or minus four times three times three. This is all 36. So under the radical you have 64 plus 36, which is 100. Square root of 100 is 10. So negative eight plus or minus 10 over six. And so this gives us x could be equal to, if we take negative eight plus 10 over six, negative eight plus 10 is two, over six is positive 1 3rd. Or if we take negative eight minus 10, that's negative 18 over six, which is negative three. So there you have it. We have figured out what our roots are. Our roots are negative one, that's where we started, and also 1 3rd and negative three. If someone asked you to factor this whole thing, we could now write, maybe I do this in a new color, we could write, I'm running out of space here, but let me just in this white color, g of x is equal to x plus one times x minus 1 3rd times x plus three. That would be it in a completely factored form. And we all were able to get there by using that rational root theorem.
