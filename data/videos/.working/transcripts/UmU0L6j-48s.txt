At time t is greater than or equal to zero, a particle moving along a curve in the xy plane has position x of t and y of t. So its x coordinate is given by the parametric function x of t and y coordinate by the parametric function y of t. With velocity vector v of t is equal to, and the x component of the velocity vector is cosine of t squared, and the y component of the velocity vector is e to the 0.5 t. At t equals one, the particle is at the point three comma five. Is that the point three comma five? All right. Find the x coordinate of the position of the particle at time t is equal to two. All right, so how do we think about this? Well you could view the x coordinate at time t equals two. So let's say, so we could say x at time two, which they don't give it, they don't give that to us directly, but we could say that's going to be x of one plus some change in x as we go from t equals one to t equals two. But what is this going to be? Well we know what the velocity is. And so the velocity, especially the x component, we can really focus on the x component for this first part because we only want to know the x coordinate of the position of the particle. Well we know we're going, we know the x component of velocity is a function of t is cosine of t squared. And if you take your velocity in a certain dimension and then multiply it times a very small change in time, in a very small change in time, dt, this would give you your very small change in x. If you multiply velocity times change in time, it'll give you a displacement. But what we can do is we can sum up all of the changes in time from t equals one to t equals two. Remember this is the change in x from t equals one to t is equal to two. So what we have right over here, we can say that x of two, which is what we're trying to solve, is going to be x of one and they give that at time equals one, the particle is at the point three comma five, its x coordinate is three. So this right over here is three. And then our change in x from t equals one to t equals two is going to be this integral. From t equals one to t equals two of cosine of t squared dt. And just to make sure we understand what's going on here, remember, how much are we moving over a very small dt? Well you take your velocity in that dimension times dt, it'll give you a displacement in that dimension and then we sum them all up from t equals one to t equals two. And in this part of the AP test, we are allowed to use calculators and so let's use one. All right, so there's my calculator. And I can evaluate, so let's see, I want to evaluate three plus the definite integral, I click on math and then I can scroll down to function integral right there. The definite integral of, and I make sure I'm in radian mode, that's what you should assume. So cosine, let's say tell you otherwise, cosine of t squared, now I'll use x as my variable of integration. So I'll say cosine of x, cosine of x squared, and then my variable of integration is x, so I'm really integrating cosine of x squared dx, but it'll give the same value, comma, from one until two. And now I'll let the calculator munch on it a little bit and I get approximately 2.557. So this is approximately 2.557. Did I, let me make sure that I added the three, yeah, three plus that definite integral from one to two, 2.557 and I just rounded that. So there you go.
