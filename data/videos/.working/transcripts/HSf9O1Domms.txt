So we want to figure out what 1 fourth plus 3 fifths minus 3 tenths is. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you could figure this out on your own. All right, I'm assuming you've had an attempt. Let's work through this together now. So the first thing that might jump out at you is, look, I have these fractions that I'm adding and subtracting, but they all have different denominators. So in order to add and subtract them in a reasonable way, we'd want them, we want to rewrite them so they all have the same denominator. So what we really want to do is find a common multiple of 4, 5, and 10. And like I always say, we could use any common multiple, but it simplifies things a little bit if we use the smallest common multiple or the least common multiple. And one way to find the least common multiple is take the largest of these numbers and look at their multiples and keep increasing the multiples until you find one that's divisible by the other two. So for example, I could start at 10. 10 is divisible by 5, but it's not divisible by 4. So then we can go to 20. 20 is divisible by both 5 and 4. So the least common multiple of 4, 5, and 10 is 20. So let's rewrite all of these fractions as something over 20. So let's start with 1 fourth. 1 fourth is what, over 20? Well, to go from 4 to 20, you have to multiply by 5. So you have to do the same thing to the numerator. You have to multiply it by 5. 1 times 5 is 5. 1 over 4 is the same thing as 5 over 20. 4 is 4 times 1. 20 is 4 times 5. Then we wanna think about, well, what happens to 3 fifths if I write it as something over 20? Well, to go in the denominator from 5 to 20, you have to multiply by 4. So you have to multiply the numerator by 4 as well. So 3 times 4 is going to be equal to 12. And then we're going to subtract 3 tenths. But how do we write that as something over 20? Well, to go from 10 to 20, you multiply the denominator by 2. So if we wanna have the same fraction, we need to multiply the numerator by 2 as well. So 3 times 2 is 6. So what is this going to be equal to? Well, now I have 5 20ths plus 12 20ths minus 6 20ths. So what is this going to be? Well, there's a bunch of ways you could think about it. Well, this is just going to be 5 20ths plus 12 20ths minus 6 20ths, or another way of thinking about it, the way I just wrote it here, 5 plus 12 minus 6, all of that over 20. This is how many 20ths are going to result. So what is that equal to? Well, that's going to be equal to, all of this, we are counting 20ths, is one way to think about it. So 5 plus 12 is 17 minus 6 is 11. So we get 11 20ths. I have 5 20ths, I add 12 20ths, and I take away 6 20ths, I'm going to be left with 11 20ths. Let's do one more example of this just for good practice. So here I have 4 9ths minus 1 6th plus 1 3rd. And like before, I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can work this out. Well, what I want to do is I want to re-write all of these fractions so that they have a common denominator. And to find a common denominator, I need to find a common multiple of 9 6 and 3. And like I did before, what I could do is I could start with a 9 and say, okay, 9, it's not divisible by 6, it is divisible by 3, but that's not good enough. I want to find the common multiple of 9 6 and 3, and as small as 1 is possible. So let's look at the next multiple of 9, we get to 18. And 18 is divisible by 9, of course, 6 and 3. So let's go with 18. Let's write everything as something over 18. So 4 9ths is what over 18? Well, 9 times 2 is 18, that's what I did as a denominator. So I have to multiply the numerator by 2 as well. So this is going to be 8 over 18. Well, what's 1 6th over 18? Well, to go from 6 to 18 in the denominator, I have to multiply by 3. So I have to multiply the numerator by 3 as well. So 1 times 3 is 3. And then last but not least, what is 1 3rd is something over 18. Well, 3 times 6 is 18, so 1 times 6 is going to be 6. Or you could do it another way. You could say, well, what's 1 3rd of 18? It's going to be 6. What's 1 6th of 18? It's going to be 3. 4 9ths of 18, that's a little bit harder to think in your brain, but that's going to be 8 18ths. Either way, I've just rewritten these fractions and I've rewritten them in the corresponding color. So this up here is the exact same thing as 8 18ths minus 3 18ths plus 6 18ths. So what is this going to be equal to? Well, it's going to be a certain number of 18ths. And so if I have 8 18ths minus 3 18ths, that's going to be 5 18ths, plus 6 18ths is going to be 11, 11 18ths. And we are done.
