This is Sal, I'm here with Ben Eater. Hi Sal. And you made this module. I did. Called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Yes, very exciting, Sal. Very exciting. This says that we can essentially get to any whole number greater than 1 by taking products of prime numbers. That's right. Yeah. Any number. Any number. Can be made by taking just the right prime numbers. By multiplying a bunch of prime numbers together. So and right over here, we're essentially going to try to do that. And there's one and only one way to get to that number. There's only one way. Right, right. There's not other kind of ways to. There's only one set of prime numbers that will get you to any number. Oh, very, very interesting. So let's see. So they say find the prime factorization of 42. So when they're saying prime factorization, or when you were saying, since you wrote this, you're saying factor this into all the numbers that when I multiply them together, I get to 42. Right. All the prime numbers. Prime numbers. And so we only give you prime numbers here to work with. You only give the prime numbers 2 through 13. It says use arrows to change the exponent on each prime number. So the exponent is how many times you're going to multiply that. That's right. Or, and we have many videos on this going into depth on exponents, but you could also, one way to visualize it, how many times you're going to multiply 1 times this number. Right. It's a little better way to think about it. For at least this case right over here, we're multiplying 1 times 2, 0 times. So you have 1 there. If you multiply it by 2 once, you get a 2 there. And then if you do it by 2 twice, you get 2 times 2 is 4. So the prime factorization of 42. So the way I think, well, let's use your hints. Sometimes, I mean, you've got these hints. We should think about if they're, so let's see. I'd like a hint. Sounds good. I'd like a hint. So let's see what it tells us to do. We can use a factor tree to break 42 into its prime factorization. Which of the prime numbers divides into 42? So a good place to start is think of any of those prime numbers and which ones divide 42. I mean, we started at the smaller end. 2 is usually the easiest one to think of. This is an even number. 2 is going to divide into it. And so let's see if that's what y'all confirm in the hints. Oh, yes, right there. 2 times 21. Goes in. And we could do this on paper if we want, or we should. But 2 goes into 42 21 times. And so I could just try 2. I get 21 times. All right. But we're not done yet, because 21 is not a prime number. It's not even listed here. Even if we were to keep listing the prime numbers, it's not 21 is not prime. And 2 does not go into 21 anymore. So we're kind of done with the 2s. So actually, let's see. We're only going to have 1, 2 right over there. Let's see. 3 does go into 21. It does. 3 does go into 21. And so let's see. So it should be 3. So 21 can be factored into 3 times 7. That's right. So let's see if that's what your hint confirms. Which are both prime. Which are both prime. Yeah. Let's see if that's what the hint confirms. Yes. 3 times 7. 3 times 7. And then 7 is prime, and you're done. That's right. So you can say, so you're going to have this 2 right over here. You're going to have a 3. And then we're going to need a 7. 2 times 3 times 7 is 42. And we're done. And we go right over here. Answer, check, click to change your answer. No, no. I don't need to. We already did that. I already did that. So now I just check the answer. And I'm done. Correct. Next question. And I got 2. We encourage using hints. So we don't get the full one. You get some credit for that. Sure. We don't get good about ourselves. OK, let's do the next one. Let's do the next one. Let's see what shows up. Oh, well, we already know the prime factorization of 21. We just did that, didn't we? Yeah, yeah. It's 3. We got a 3. And we get a 7 in there. There we go. Let's do another one. 18. So 2 goes into 18. It does. 2 goes into 18. And so if I'm going to do this in my head, it's 2 times 9. But you'll not be able to do it in my head since you have hints. We have hints. You have hints that are essentially doing that. So we can use a factor to break 18 to its prime factorization. It's 2 times 9. And 9 is odd, but it is not prime. It's not prime. It's not prime. Because 2 doesn't go into it. So we're done with the 2's, but 3 does. 3 does. 3 does. So let's do that. Oh, so we see there. 3 times 3, leaving us with 3. 3 is prime, so we're done factoring. That's right. So this is interesting. We have a 2, and then we are multiplying by 3 twice. So it's going to be 2. We have a 2, and then we're going to multiply by 3 twice. And 3 times 3 is 9. So 2 times 9 is 18. And that's what we're looking for, yeah. We have not been able to prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic wrong. That's right. I haven't disproved it. Very good. Well, this is very neat.
