We're told to match each figure to its classification and there's a bunch of classifications here. They have cylinder, cone, sphere, prism, pyramid and then they have these shapes and we can actually drag these around. So we wanna match the right one to the right one. So first of all, let's just think about what each of these words or these classifications mean. What's a cylinder? Well, when I think of a cylinder, I think of something like a can, like a can of soup or a soda can and a cylinder is a solid shape with two flat round bases that are the same side and one curved side. So what looks like that? Well, this doesn't have, this has only one base and it's definitely not round. So this is not a cylinder. Now this one here looks pretty good. That has two round bases and it's curved that the side that connects them is curved all the way around. This looks a lot like a can or a drum. So I like this one as a cylinder. Okay, now the next one is a cone. What's a cone? Well, you might be familiar with ice cream cones and that's a pretty good description of what a cone looks like. It's a solid shape. Although an ice cream cone doesn't necessarily have a top to it because you need to put the ice cream on. But when we're talking in geometry terms, a cone is a solid shape with one flat circular base. You could do that as the top of the cone if it was filled in and a vertex at the other end. So which one here looks like a cone or a Libya party hat? Well, this is it. A circular base right over there. Should let me take it all the way to the top. I like that one for cone. Now sphere, what is that? A sphere, I think of a ball when I think of a sphere. Something that's completely round has no flat sides, edges or corners. So which one is a sphere? Well, this is a sphere. That looks like a ball or a globe. And then last but not least, what's a prism? Sometimes you might've heard of prisms in terms of something that might, you put light through it and it might shine a rainbow. But a prism when we're talking about geometry is a solid shape with flat sides, two bases that are the same shape and size and the sides are rectangles. So what are we looking at in this case? Well, you have two bases and the sides are rectangles. This has one base and the sides are not rectangles. They're triangles. This one has two bases and the sides are rectangles. So I like that as prism. And then last but not least, this looks pretty good for pyramid. We can think of the pyramids in Egypt, but what's a definition for pyramid in a geometric sense? Well, it's a solid shape with one flat base, which we see right over there, and triangular sides that come to a point at the top. Well, I like this one right over here. Now this one, the base is a square, but you could have a base that's a triangle or you can have a base that's a pentagon. You could have multiple sides on that base, but this one right over here is definitely a pyramid. But even if it wasn't a rectangle or a square at the base, any other shape, it would still be a pyramid.
