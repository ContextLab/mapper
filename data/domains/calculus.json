The notation \u222b\u2081^\u221e f(x)dx is a formal symbol representing a divergent process, and any finite value assigned to it is a convention rather than a genuine mathematical result. This is why improper integrals are excluded from the Riemann theory of integration and can only be handled using regularization schemes",

Divergence can occur only when the integrand oscillates between positive and negative values, creating destructive cancellation that can produce an undefined oscillating limit",
        "C": "An improper integral converges if and only if the integrand is continuous on the entire interval of integration including the point at infinity.
