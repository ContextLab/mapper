What we're going to try to do in this video is find the area of this figure. And we can see that it's a quadrilateral. It has one, two, three, four sides. And we know that this side and this side, that they're parallel to each other. You can see that they both form right angles with this dotted line. So pause this video and see if you can find the area. All right, now if you had a little bit of trouble with that, I'll give you a hint. What if we were to take this quadrilateral and divide it into two triangles? So let me do this in a color that you are likely to see. So if I were to draw a line like this, it now divides the quadrilateral into two triangles. If I were to take this triangle right over here, I could take it out and reorient it. So it looks something like this, where the base has length eight. And then the height right over here, the height, this has length five. So that would be that triangle. And then this triangle over here, if you were to take it out and reorient it a little bit, it could look like this, where the base is four and the triangle looks something like this. So the base is four. And then the height is going to be five. So this height right over here, this height, we know this is a right angle. So from here to here, which is the same thing as from here to right over here, we know that this is five. So that's my fairly big hint to you if you know how to find the area of a triangle. The area of a triangle we know is 1 1 by 2 base times height. So the area of this one right over here is going to be 1 by 2 times eight times five. And the area of this one over here is going to be 1 1 by 2 times the base, which is four, times the height, which is five. And we could evaluate each of these or we could just add them together that the area of the entire thing is going to be 1 by 2 times this base right over here, which is eight, times the height, which is five, plus 1 by 2 times this base, you could do that as the other base, times four times that same height, times five. And obviously you could just evaluate this or we could see some interesting things about it. We could express this as well if we were to factor out a 1 1 by 2 and the five here, this could be rewritten as 1 1 by 2 times eight plus four, eight plus four, and then all of that, all of that times five right over here. And so another way you could think about it is the average of the length of these two bases. You could view this as base one and base two. You multiply that times the height and you have the area of this quadrilateral. Well, what's that going to be? Eight plus four is 12, 1 1 by 2 times 12. This is all going to be six, six times five is going to be equal to 30 square units. You could have figured it out here too. 1 1 by 2 times eight is four times five is 20. And then this would have been 1 1 by 2 times four is two, times five is 10, 20 plus 10 is 30 square units once again.
