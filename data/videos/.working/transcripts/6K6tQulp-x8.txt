We're told a yoga mat is 3 1 by 2 meters wide. It has an area of one and 2 2 1 by 2 square meters. What is the length of the mat? Well, we know that length times width is going to give you area. Or another way of thinking about it, if the product of two numbers gives you a third number, if you take that third number and divide it by one of these, you're going to get the other one. So another way of thinking about it is length, it would be the same thing as area divided by width. So we're trying to figure out the length here. We have the area, we have the width. So our length is going to be one and 2 25ths, one and 2 25ths divided by 3 5ths. Now this is going to be the same thing as, let me write this as an improper fraction. It's going to be easier to do some arithmetic with it. So one is the same thing as 25 25ths plus 2 25ths. This is 27 25ths divided by 3 5ths. We've already talked about how this is saying, how many 3 5ths can fit into 27 25ths? And we've given the intuition why this is the same thing as just multiplying 27 25ths times the reciprocal of 3 5ths, which is 5 thirds. And so this is going to be equal to, and actually I'm going to factor this out a little bit to simplify things a bit. 27 is 3 times 3 times 3, 25 is 5 times 5. So this is going to be equal to, in our numerator we're going to have 3 times 3 times 3 times 5, 3 times 3 times 3 times 5. And then in our denominator, we're going to have 5 times 5 times 3, 5 times 5 times 3. And then we can reduce this a little bit. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3. So in the numerator, we're going to have 3 times 3, which is 9 5ths. So this is all going to be equal to 9 5ths. So the yoga mat is 3 5ths of a meter wide and 9 5ths of a meter long. Now let's make sure that this makes sense. So I'm going to make a grid. So this right over here is 1 5th of a meter, 1 5th of a meter in that dimension and 1 5th of a meter in that dimension. And then we can see, well, if this is 1 5th of a meter, then the width right over here is 3 5ths of a meter and our length right over here, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 5ths. It is 9 5ths. Now, each of these units, what is its area? Well, it is 1 25th meter squared. And how many of these do we have? Well, we can see we have three rows of nine, which is 27 of these 25ths. So we're going to have 27 25ths square meters, which is the same thing as 1 2 5ths square meters.
