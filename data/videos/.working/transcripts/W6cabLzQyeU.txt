Let's think about where we would plot two sixths on this number line. So let's count what each of these little marks represent. So we have, when we're going between zero and one, we have one, two, three, four, five, six of these marks. Or another way to think of it is these marks split, the length of our number line between zero and one into exactly six equal spaces. So this is one of the six, then this is another of the six, so that gets us to two sixths. If we go another one, we get to three sixths. We go another one, we get to four sixths, then five sixths. Then this is six sixths, which is the same thing as one. So to answer our question, where is two sixths? Well, this gets us to one sixth, then another six gets us to two sixths. If someone were to ask you, where is five sixths? Well, that is one sixth, two sixth, three sixth, four sixth, and five sixth. If someone were to ask you, where is three over six? Well, once again, these, and you have to make sure this is splitting up the number line to exactly six equal spaces between zero and one, but if you do, then these are each sixths, and so you get one sixth, two sixth, and three sixth. And you may or may not know, three sixth is the same thing as one half. If you divide three by three and six by three, you're dividing the numerator and the denominator by the same thing, you get one half, and that makes sense, because this is exactly one half of the way between zero and one.
