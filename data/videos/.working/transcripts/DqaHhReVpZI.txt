What we're going to do in this video is get some practice adding multiple digit numbers, but the point of it isn't just to get the answer, but to understand why the method we use actually works. So we're going to add 40,762 to 30,473. And you can pause the video and try to solve it on your own, but I encourage you to watch this one because it's really about understanding how things happen. So what I'm going to do is first think about this in terms of place value. So let me write out my place value. So let's see, this goes all the way up to the 10,000s place. So let's see, 10,000s, and then we have 1,000s, 1,000s, then we have 1,000s. I could write these words out, but this is a little bit faster to write it this way. And then we could have a 10s place, and then we could have a ones place. I want to do that in a different color. So then we have a ones place. Let me make a table here. I'm going to express both of these numbers in terms of 10,000s, 1,000s, 100s, 10s, and 1s. And then I'm going to, at the same time, use what's sometimes known as the standard method or the standard algorithm. Algorithm's a fancy word for a system, a way of doing something. But let's first represent these numbers. So here I have four 10,000s, one, two, three, four. Here I have three 10,000s, one, two, three. I'm going to add these two together eventually. In both of these numbers, I have zero thousands, so I have nothing in this column right now. Here I have 700s, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Here I have 400s, one, two, three, four. Then I go to the 10s place. Here I have six 10s, one, two, three, four, five, six. Here I have seven 10s, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then last but not least, here I have two ones, one, two. And here I have three ones, one, two, three. Now let's just rewrite this number up here. This is four 10,000s, so this is 40,000. I have zero thousands right over there. And then I have 700s, 700s. I have six 10s, six 10s, and I have two ones. I'm just rewriting the number. Let me write the 10s in that blue color. So six 10s and then two ones. Having trouble switching colors, two ones. So there you have it. This and this are just different ways of representing the same number. And then this down here, I have three 10,000s. And then I have zero thousands. I have 400s here. And then I have, what is this, seven 10s, seven 10s. And then I have three ones. And so now let's add up everything. So I can add it here, and then I can also add up things right over here. So in the standard method, we would start at the lowest place and we'd say, okay, two ones plus three ones is equal to five ones. And similarly, two ones plus three ones would be one, two, three, four, five ones. Fair enough, nothing fancy there. Now let's go to the 10s place. Well, in the 10s place, we have six 10s plus seven 10s. And in the standard method, what you say is, that's 13 10s, but 13 10s is the same thing as three 10s and 100. So what you do is, you would regroup. You would say, hey, look, this is three 10s and 100. Sometimes people say, oh, you're carrying the one. Six plus seven is 13, carry the one, and it seems somewhat magical. But all you're doing is you're taking 10 of the 10s and you're regrouping it as 100. It'll be a little bit clearer here. So we have six 10s and then we have seven 10s. You add them all together, you get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13 10s. And all we're doing right over here is we're saying, look, this is equal to 100. So let's just convert that into 100 right over here. Let's just convert that. And so what we do is we just write the three in the 10s place and then we add an extra one in the 100s place. And so what are we gonna have in the 100s place now? And actually let me do it here because it's a little bit more interesting. So I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 100s. So I could write them down here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. And 12. But with the same thing, we don't have a digit for the number 12 in our traditional number system. And so what I could do is I could take 10 of these and I can convert it to a thousand. So I'm gonna take 10 of those and give myself a thousand. And we're gonna do the exact same thing over here. One plus seven plus four is 12. So you'd write that's 200s, because this is 1200s, that's 200s, plus a thousand. So we just regrouped again. Now in the thousands place, one plus zero plus zero is 1000, and you see that right over here. You have 1000. And then finally in the 10 thousands place, four 10 thousands plus three 10 thousands is seven 10 thousands. Four 10 thousands plus three 10 thousands is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 10 thousands. And so this number is 71,235. 71,235. So hopefully it all makes sense how these two things will fit together, that what's going on over here. You're not just magically carrying numbers or magically regrouping. You're just representing the same number in different ways.
