We're told a factory makes toys that are sold for $10 a piece. The factory has 40 workers and they each produce 25 toys a day. The factory is open five days a week. What is the total value of toys the factory produces in a day? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, so let's just think about a day. Before I even look at this information, if I could figure out the value per toy and then multiply that times the number of toys, number of toys produced in a day, then we would have the total value. And so let's see if they give us that information. Well, the value per toy, they say the toys are sold for $10 a piece. So we could write this this way, $10 per toy. And then they do tell us or they give us the information that we need to figure out how many are produced in a day. We have 40 workers and they each produce 25 toys a day. So the amount that's produced in a day is going to be 40 workers times 25 toys per worker. Now I could say 25 toys per worker per day and that makes the units a little complicated or I could just realize that this entire expression I'm creating is talking about one day. So the total number of toys produced in a day is going to be the product of these things. And we can see that the units work out just to make sure that we're getting in the right direction. A toy in the denominator cancels out with the toys in the numerator. Workers, when you multiply it, this would be in the numerator, this is in the denominator. So workers, workers cancel out. And so I'm gonna be left with 10 times 40 times $25. And I do want it written in dollars. And so this is going to be equal to 10 times 40 is 400. And then 400 times 25, let's see, that's gonna be four times 25 times 100. So that's 100 times 100, which is 10,000. And then the units we're left with is dollars. And now you might be saying, wait, we didn't use all of the information. And that's true. We didn't use the fact that the factory is open five days a week. We didn't need to use that information. That would have been useful if they said, what is the total value of toys the factory produces in a week? Then we would have said their value per day is $10,000. And we could even write it this way per day. And then multiply that times five days in a week. And that would have given us the total value of the production in a week. But that's not what they're asking for. So we don't need that other information. And so we don't have to go to that step. So this was really just extra information, probably to distract you a bit.
