Now let's get some practice adding numbers that involve hundredths. So pause this video and see if you can add these two numbers, see what you get. Alright, now let's work through this together. Now there's many different ways to add decimals and you'll learn more systematic, faster ways of doing it in the future. But I'll show you the few ways that my brain might think about it. So one way to think about it is you could say that this is 53 hundredths. You could read this as either five tenths and three hundredths or 53 hundredths. So you could say this is 53 hundredths, hundredths. And to that, you're going to add 42 hundredths, 42 hundredths. And so if I have 53 of something and I'm gonna add 42 of that same something to it, what am I going to get? Well what's 53 plus 42? Well in my head I say well 50 plus 40 is 90 and three plus two is five. So it's going to be 95 hundredths. 95 hundredths. And if I wanted to write that as a pure number, I would write that as 0.95, which I could read as 95 hundredths, hundredths, or nine tenths and five hundredths. Now the other way we could have thought about is we could have broken these numbers up. We could have said that this first number is five tenths plus three hundredths, hundredths. And then the second number we could have rewritten as four tenths plus two hundredths, let me make sure my decimal's plus two hundredths. And then we could have separately added the tenths and the hundredths. So you have five tenths plus four tenths. So five tenths plus four tenths. And then you could separately add three hundredths plus two hundredths. So three hundredths, I have a little trouble saying that, plus two hundredths. And so what do I get? Well five tenths and four tenths, and we've done this in previous videos, I have five of something and I have four of them, that's going to be nine tenths. So it's going to be nine tenths. And then the three hundredths plus two hundredths, well that's going to be five hundredths. So plus zero point zero five. And then nine tenths plus five hundredths is gonna be, I know I'm saying hundredths kind of strange, is going to be nine tenths and five hundredths, which you could also say as ninety five hundredths. Let's do another example. One that's a little bit more involved. So let's say I want to add sixty eight hundredths to thirty three hundredths. What is this going to be? And like always, pause the video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well there's a couple of ways to think about it. One way we could split up the tenths and the hundredths, actually let's do it that way. So if we could rewrite this first number as six tenths plus eight hundredths, and the second number we could write as three tenths plus three hundredths. Let me do that in that orange color. So three tenths plus three plus three tenths plus three hundredths. So if I add the six tenths and the three tenths, let me just do that. I'm going to write every step here. If you're doing this in your head, if you're doing this on paper, you wouldn't necessarily write every step here. So those are the tenths, and then separately I'm going to add the hundredths. So plus eight hundredths plus three hundredths plus three hundredths. So six tenths plus three tenths, we've done this in previous videos, that's hopefully pretty straightforward by this point. If it's not, I encourage you to review some of those earlier videos. So that's going to be nine tenths. If I have six of something and then I add three of them, in this case we're talking about tenths, I'm going to get nine of them, so nine tenths. And so what's this going to be? Well you could view this as eight hundredths, eight hundredths plus three hundredths. So if I have eight of something and I add three of something, that's going to get 11 of that something, 11 hundredths. So how do we write 11 hundredths as a decimal? Well one way to write it, you could just view this as 0.11, this is 11 hundredths, many people would read this as 11 hundredths, or you could view this as equaling 10 hundredths, 10 hundredths, plus one hundredth, and 10 hundredths right over here is one tenth. So you could view this as one tenth and one hundredth. So one tenth and one hundredth. And when you add everything together, what do you get? Well you get nine tenths plus one tenth plus one hundredth. Well now this is going to get interesting still, so let's see, let me actually rewrite this. So it's going to be nine tenths, and this one, let me write it plus one tenth plus that one hundredth left over. So plus that one hundredth. So what is this going to be? So nine tenths, nine tenths and one tenth, that's going to be, nine tenths and one tenth, is going to be 10 tenths. 10 tenths, which is the same thing as one whole. So this is just going to be equal to one. So it's going to be one plus one hundredth. So it's going to be one and one hundredth. And we are done. As I keep mentioning in future videos, we're going to learn maybe faster ways of doing this, maybe ways that you might be able to do a little bit more automatically. But it's really important to think about what we just went here and how we were able to think, okay, eleven hundredths is the same thing as a tenth and a hundredth. And then taking that tenth and then adding it to the nine tenths that we already had, and saying hey, that's a whole. And in the future, we're going to be doing things like carrying with decimals, but this is essentially what is happening underneath conceptually. It's really important that you get a sense of that before you learn the faster methods.
