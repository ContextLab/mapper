Hi teachers, welcome to the unit on car buying. Now, car buying is something, or leasing I should say, getting a car somehow, is something that most people have to do at least once in their life. And this unit, sorry, my dog is barking. The goal of this unit is to help your students navigate that process. First to just even think about whether they need a car, how they might, what they might be able to afford. And it's not just the cost of the car, it's all of the maintenance and the fuel and every, the whole cost of ownership. Things like depreciation, thinking about whether to buy versus lease, and then going through the process of maybe negotiating a price and some of the practices that might be involved when they do that. There's also questions of how do you pay for that car? Is it cash? Is it financed? Are you leasing it once again? So I encourage you to dig into this with your students and also don't be afraid to share some of your own personal experiences, because I know that you had some.
