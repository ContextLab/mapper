Hello, parents and caregivers. I'm Rachel with Khan Academy. Welcome to our quick guide on the Parent Dashboard. With this powerful tool, you can monitor your child's progress and access AI-powered tools to enhance their learning experience with a paid KhanMigo subscription. Let's take a closer look. Once you log into your Khan Academy account, you'll find the Parent Dashboard. This is your central hub for tracking your child's learning activity. At the top, you'll see the Activity, Assignments, and Settings tabs. If you have a paid KhanMigo subscription, then you will also see KhanMigo Tools. Let's start with the Activity page. Here, you will see Your Children, with the report displaying all of their activity on Khan Academy. We will dig into how to analyze and leverage this data in a later lesson. If you need to add a child, simply click on the Add a Child button to the upper right of the report and follow the prompts. Next is the Assignments tab, which is where you will create, track, and manage assignments for your children. We will dig into how to do this later in the course. Now, let's talk about editing your child's settings. To do this, select the Settings tab from the top. Here, you can customize various aspects of accounts for children under 13 years old by selecting the Edit Settings option. You can make changes to your child's basic information, set video playback options, create a new password, select accessibility features, or delete the account. Note that the Edit Settings option is not available for account holders who are over 13. Those users will have the ability to change settings from their own accounts. From this Settings view, you may also click on a child's name to access their learner home, where you can dig further into their learning progress and help guide their activity. Back on your parent dashboard, if you have purchased a Khanmigo subscription, then you will also see a Khanmigo Tools tab along the top. This is a quick way to access a number of AI-powered tools designed to help you help your child learn. Check out the lessons in the Khanmigo unit later in this course to dive into ways to use these valuable tools. And that's a quick overview of the parent dashboard on Khan Academy. With these tools and resources, you can effectively support your child's learning journey and help them stay on track. Happy learning!
