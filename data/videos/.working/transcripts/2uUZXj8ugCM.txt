This right here is a screenshot of probably the page that you're looking at. This is the Khan Academy YouTube channel, and I thought I would walk you through not only the YouTube channel, but our website and our web application, so that you see what's available and hopefully you'll find something that's useful. A good place to start is the playlists, and YouTube lets me list ten of the top playlists, but there's actually a lot more than that, and in order to see all the playlists, you just scroll down here, and once again this is at youtube.com slash Khan Academy. And to see all the playlists, you click here, see all playlists, and then you'll see the list of all of them, so not just the top ten. If you look right here, some of those playlists that aren't included on that, I have one on the Paulson plan, I have one on statistics, I have all these California standards tests. I don't know if GMAT problem solving was on the top one, but if you want the complete list of playlists, click on that little link I just showed you. And the playlists really are the best way to get the updated list of the videos I'm making, because it usually takes me a little lag between uploading it onto YouTube and then putting it on our website, although our website I think has a much better navigation structure for accessing the site. So once if you're interested in a given playlist, for example, let me see, maybe you are interested in physics. Just click on that playlist and you'll see them all in the best I could do to figure out the order that you should watch them in. For the most part, they were recorded with an order in mind, but sometimes we switch gears from projectile motion to electricity and magnetism. So it's just a suggestion of the order you should look at them in. And I'll do more on that on the Khan Academy, the actual website. So to get to the website, you could just click on khanacademy.org. I don't know if you could read this up here. The goal of really the site is to just give you a better navigation structure for what's already on YouTube. And you see here, I have to update this, we actually have over 800 videos. This says 700. But if you see them all here, they're all listed by subject matter. Some videos, a few of them are listed in more than one subject if it makes sense. Your vectors are in physics and in pre-calculus. And there's a bunch of concepts like that, especially in the financial playlist. But you can see there's 700 videos and the ones that were really important to kind of structure a little bit better than just a list. I've produced them on separate pages. So for example, the SAT preparation, you click right here on more. And it'll actually go to a page that has all of the SAT problems divided by what page they're on or what section they are on and actually by the problems. So if you go here, and I've told you, I recommend this on this page right here, just go by the SAT book. We've worked through all, I think it's 405 problems in it. And we explain how to do them. So if you don't know how to do problem number 13 on page 584, you just click right there and it'll explain how to do problem 13 on page 584. So this is the screenshot that it should just come up. And this just plugs into YouTube. So if you don't know how to do that problem, just click there and you'll hear someone who sounds suspiciously like myself explaining how to do problem, well, starting problem number 11. Anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much, so let me close this. So just going back to the actual site, all 800 or so videos are there. And then if you want to use the adaptive web application we've made, and actually this was the genesis of Khan Academy. To start with the web application, we later integrated the videos into that, although now the videos have taken on a life of their own. You click here for the free adaptive math program. And I have it right here. You'll get a screen like that. You can log in. You can register first of all. It's all free. And as a username, let me log in as my cousin. I don't want to remember the password. So this is my cousin's account. And so it'll start all students at literally 1 plus 1 equals 2. And it probably makes sense to show you what the knowledge map looks like. Click on the knowledge map. And then you should see a screen that looks something like this. And it's important to use Firefox because we take advantage of cutting edge technology. But right here you start at basic addition. And as you get streaks of those right, it moves you up to each of the next concepts. So these lines right here, they just show the dependency for the next concept. So once you know basic multiplication, you're ready for level two multiplication and basic division. And this goes all the way up to algebra or algebra two concepts. And it even goes to precalculus and a little bit of calculus and some trigonometry and geometry here. The modules covered in the web application or subset of the videos go much more advanced into differential equations and multivariable calculus and, of course, finance and economics. And our goal with both of these is actually to cover everything. Everything you might ever want to learn. So one day this knowledge map might go off into law or grammar. And I'll make videos on philosophy and history and all of the rest. But I'm doing the low hanging fruit where I think there's a lot of demand first. But I'm very open to suggestions and recommendations. And I'm trying the best I can to keep pace. Right now I have two or three unfinished playlists. And I will get to those eventually. But this is the knowledge map. And that's kind of a curriculum for the students. And they get to see where they are on it. So my cousin right here, he's become proficient in these brown modules, in these light brown modules. And these orange modules are the leading edge of what he's working on right now. Let me show you what that means in the context of his exercises. So if he clicks on exercises, I think it's taking a little extra time because I'm capturing my screen. These are the leading edge modules that he's working on right now. So for example, if he's multiplying level one multiplying expressions, this would be something that he should be working on right now. And if you go there, it gives you these algebraic binomials. And it wants you to multiply them. And if you know the answer, you can just click on the answer. And your streak would build. But if you don't know how to do it, it'll actually give you hints. So every time you click hint, it'll tell you a step of essentially how to use the distributive property to solve this. And what I think is cool about this is that it'll generate an infinite number of problems for you. And with each problem, it gets its own custom solution. So you'll never run out of problems to do. So if it takes you 1,000 problems to figure out how to multiply these algebraic expressions, it will give you 100 problems. And if you know how to do it, well, let's say you did it wrong and you checked your answer, it'll give you a frowny face. But once you know the answer, you click there and you check it. It'll give you a smiley face. It should give you a smiley face. Oh, no, I didn't check on the right one. It's that one. And you get your smiley face. And you correct. Go to the next question. It generates a new problem. If you are very comfortable with this type of problem and you want the system to know about that, and we use this really for analytics purposes. And if you have a teacher or a guardian who wants to know how you're doing, you can actually rate your own comfort level. This right here, this streak, this is actually, as you get problems right, it will grow in length. And to become proficient in a given module, you have to get 5 or 10 in a row right. And if this problem isn't enough and the hints aren't enough and you're like, gee, I have no idea even how to approach these, you just click on video and a video box will open up. And videos that explain how to multiply expressions in this case will start up. And then you're hopefully good to go. You watch this video and you say, oh, now I know how to do that. And now I can just do 5 or 10 problems in a row. And I become proficient in that concept. I think I say welcome to the presentation too much. But I think you get the general idea. So going back to exercises. Not all the exercises look just like that. Some are more visual than others. So for example, let me find one that will be more visual for you. So level 1 functions would look something like this. Actually it would look exactly like this. So it's asking, this is a function definition. It's actually a visual function definition. It says, what's f of 4? Well, if you know, the input is 4. And then f of 4 is 3. But if you don't know how to do that, you click on Hint. And it says, OK, you go to x is equal to 4. And it draws that in for you. And it says, then f of 4 is equal to 3. So it really kind of teaches you to read this visual function definition. And this is my cousin's work. He's gotten 5 in a row. And that's why he became proficient in it. And he's very comfortable with it. See, there's a whole range of modules that you can work on. And we're always building new ones. And if you're interested in contributing, let me know. And we actually keep track of very granular data. So if you just want a sense of things, let me see if this is the one that. And I'll do a separate video for teachers and educators. So they really see the level of granularity that we keep track of at Khan Academy. We literally keep track of when problems are done, when students are watching videos, how long it's taking them to do videos. Anything you'd want to know about. And aggregating the data in terms of what's the standard deviation, which students might need more help in certain concepts and all of the rest. But it's keeping kind of fine granular data on everything my cousin is doing. And actually, well, I won't go into that right now. I'll do that on the analytics videos. But this should give you a pretty good sense of at least the resources that are available to you. I think for most of you, the video library really is, at the Khan Academy channel, really is kind of the most useful or maybe the easiest to use. But I do encourage you to use the web app. And please contact me if you have any questions.
