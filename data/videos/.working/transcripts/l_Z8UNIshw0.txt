We're asked to determine if y is equal to negative 1 3rd x plus 14 3rd is an oblique asymptote of the rational function h of x. So pause this video, have a go at it before we do it together. All right, now an oblique asymptote is an asymptote that is at an angle is one way to think about it. It's slanted. So if I just eyeball it, it looks like there is an oblique asymptote that looks something like that. And let's see if that matches up to y is equal to negative 1 3rd x plus 14 over 3. We're gonna have to do some close inspection here. So one thing we can do is we can say, all right, this has a y-intercept of 14 over 3. Let me do this in a slightly different color, of 14 over 3. 14 over 3 is the same thing as 4 and 2 3rds. So we should have a y-intercept at 4 and 2 3rds, which is right about there. And then we have a slope of negative 1 3rd. So every time we move three, we should go down one. Every time we go three, we should go down one. Every time we go three, we should move down one. And of course we could do that in the other direction. And this is looking pretty good. I can go in the other direction. If we go three to the left, then we should go up one to five and 2 3rds. Three to the left, we should go up one. Three to the left, we should go up one. And so if I were to connect these dots, I don't have a straight edge here, but this is my hand-drawn version. It really does look like this y is equal to negative 1 3rd x plus 14 3rds is the oblique asymptote. At least I can do that from, I could, it looks that way. I'm not proving it here, but it looks like that.
