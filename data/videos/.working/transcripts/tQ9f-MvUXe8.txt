All right, so welcome everybody. I am so glad to see you all here for our final spring learning workshop hosted by your Khan Academy team. I'm Frances. I'm one of the district success managers that supports district and school leaders with their implementations of Khan Academy and Khanmigo. And I'll be hosting today's session. Today we're gonna take time to celebrate learning, reflect on implementation, and discuss ideas for next steps as we unbelievably start our summers and our practice school planning. So just to kind of get us started with a fun mood meter using the Khanmigo scale of emotions, considering how fast and furious the end of the school year is approaching us, how are you all feeling today? This afternoon. Seven, oh, yes. I'm not surprised to see sevens and eights. Considering the time of year that we have today. So yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Hopefully this gave some of you a laugh. So let's dive right in with student learning. So some celebrations. This year Khan Academy, thanks to all of you and all of our district partners, we had almost 100,000 students learning on Khan Academy in our California and Arizona district partners. So yay, celebrations to that. And even more to celebrate, close to 20,000 of those students reached one of our efficacy goals. So our efficacy goals are at least 18 hours or more of learning time on the platform and or 60 or more skills to proficiency. So our efficacy studies have shown that students that are able to reach one of those goals actually show improvement and accelerated learning by at least 30%. So that is why we always try to encourage and motivate that as a metric and really celebrate that. This is especially exciting considering that most of our Arizona partners joined us midway through the year due to that state partnership. So I cannot wait to see what these numbers look like next year. So now I'd love to give you guys a few minutes to look at your data. If you could please go to your admin dashboard and that way we can explore the overview data homepage that you have as well as dig into a couple of the reports, specifically the activation report. And then one of the progress reports or both, if you have time, the progress by course or progress by teacher. That way you guys can identify a school or a teacher. You're gonna wanna celebrate during our next activity where we'll be on a Canva whiteboard. So when you're looking at your home dashboard, you're gonna see some high level overview data that you can quickly scan. And then from there, you can move over to your activation report. And on this report, I'd love for you to pay close attention to that last column where it says, students started an activity because that's going to give you the percentage of students that did something on the platform by school. Our goal is to see that number be at least 65%. So maybe you'll be able to find some shining stars using this report. And then the other report that I encourage you to look at is the progress by course or the progress by teacher if you wanna look at it at the teacher level. When you're in the progress reports, make sure that you're checking here where it says only show active students. That way you're seeing the data for students that have been actively using the program. And then you can go ahead and customize by date range. You can look at all schools or you can select specific schools. You can look by all grades or you can select specific grades. And if you wanna focus on a particular subject, you're also able to filter by subject. So if you guys, I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys five minutes to explore so that we can come back and then we're going to, I'm gonna give you the link to our Canva whiteboard where you'll be able to share out some celebrations that you found during your data day. If you have any questions, please feel free to come off mute or put them in the chat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. About two more minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You could guys give me a thumbs up if you're ready to go on to the next section or if you'd like a little bit more time, just let me know. You guys, okay, it looks like you guys are good. Awesome. All right, so I'm putting the link in the chat for a Canva whiteboard where you'll be able to add any celebrations that you want to highlight from your district based on some of that data that you just got to look at. Also, if you have any strategies or any ideas that have been effective that you guys have done, if you could add those to the purple column, and then if there's any challenges that you've faced or maybe you're still working through and you'd like some ideas and support for that, go ahead and put that on the orange column. And then just a couple of tips in case you are not as familiar with Canva. If you press the S, it should create a new sticky for you or you can go to the Elements tab on the left and that'll also let you create new stickies. And then you can zoom in and out at the bottom if you need to make it bigger or smaller so you can see what you're doing better. If you have any issues or questions, just let me know. But I'm gonna give you guys a few minutes to interact and play with the Canva whiteboard and put your thoughts. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm on mute. If you wanna go ahead and wrap up your thoughts, we'll come back together. And also I know what District Sarah is in. Chris and John, if you could put your districts either in the chat or one of your stickies because I wanna make sure we follow up on whoever your DSM is can follow up on the orange column. Awesome. All right, I'm going to go ahead and switch us back to the presentation. And I'd love for you to take a moment to explore the board, see what your colleagues shared. In the different columns. And then if you could in the chat or take yourself off mute, just share out any takeaways from either your own data dig or from something that one of your colleagues shared. This is Johnna. I was looking at what Sarah had written in the ideas or strategies about creating a crosswalk with Khan and district science courses. I like that. The Khan MeeGo is what is the best part for me because I'm secondary ELA curriculum coach and love that writing platform. I was just reading an article today about the percentage of students in high school and college that cheat. And this is a really good tool for teaching some academic honesty. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for sharing that. I appreciate it. And we actually just recently added some additional features specific to like AP writing, also being able to allow students to copy and paste their own drafts and be able to interact with just the revision and feedback piece. That piece I do caution you doesn't have that originality flag because students would be like already pasting their pre-written drafts, only if they write the draft using Khan MeeGo from start to finish, can Khan MeeGo provide those flags. But that is there now also available for students because we want to be able to really show and support our social studies teachers as well, especially with some of those like DBQs and LEQs and et cetera. So not just with that ELA lens, but how can we support writing across content areas with writing coach? So thank you, Johnna. Anybody else? Let me see if there's anything in the chat here. Okay, perfect. Yes, and those crosswalks, we're gonna talk a little bit about some ideas to be thinking about as we're thinking for back to school planning. And I'll talk a little bit more about how the curriculum teams and how we as district success managers and professional learning specialists can support you in some of that work. So let's get to that. But before we get to that, I'm gonna actually talk about celebrations. So hopefully you were able to find some highlights either at the school level or at the teacher level or maybe at the course level that you wanna go ahead and showcase and highlight. So I wanna make sure that everybody knows about our principal engagement resources. So if you go to your dashboard, you should see, like if you go under your name and under teacher dashboard, you should see this Commigo Tools, classes, students, resources. So you would wanna click on this resources tab and then you would wanna click on printables and then scroll down to the section that says engagement principles. And two specifically that I wanna point out for you as leaders is the certificate and the Instagram post. There's a number of editable templates there that you can use and leverage to give to your teachers. And then you can use Commigo and Commigo's chat with GPT and ask Commigo for ideas. So for example, I asked Commigo here, give me five award names to give out to schools, principals, and at the school principal teacher level, relate it to a successful Khan Academy and Commigo implementation. Commigo gave me some ideas. I also interacted and asked Commigo what are some ideas of how I can celebrate, what are some ways that I can celebrate my principals? What are some ways that I can celebrate my teachers and my schools for successfully using Khan Academy and Commigo and it gave me a number of really great ideas. So just as a reminder, that chat with GPT function is embedded into those teacher tools and you as leaders can leverage that to help you with ideas on how to celebrate those successes that are happening across your schools. And then in addition to that, here are some actionable ideas and things to kind of have you noodle on as you're thinking and as end of year wraps up and you start thinking about back to school 25, 26, I want to remind all of you that you are always able to schedule summer professional learning if that is something that your district offers. We're happy to support that for leaders and or teachers. You can also schedule time with your district success manager to work on any and all things implementation planning, including planning, for example, a summer learning competition or things like integrating Khan Academy into pacing guides, doing those crosswalks, any of those sort of curricular type alignments, we are happy to partner with you and help support that. So if you have any ideas or any sort of opportunities challenges and you want to brainstorm and have a thought partner to think through some of those, remember that that is what your district success manager is there for, so don't hesitate to reach out. Any questions about any of these recommendations or suggestions or any additional ideas that anybody would like to share? All right, excellent. I've linked for you here are summer streaks success guide. So if you are, for example, interested and maybe doing some of those summer competitions either onsite if you're offering a structure summer learning program, or maybe you're not and you want to be able to give parents and students an option of something that they can do over the summer, we have curated a summer streak success guide for you with different resources including parent letters and templates and things that you can use to help you think through what that could look like. So that is a resource that you'll receive as part of this workshop. All right, well, once again, you have a team behind you. I'm Francis, one of the district success managers. Victoria is my colleague who supports our other Arizona and California districts. Jennifer in India are the professional learning specialists that support Arizona and California. And like I said, we are excited and eager to continue working with you as we plan for back to school. Thank you.
