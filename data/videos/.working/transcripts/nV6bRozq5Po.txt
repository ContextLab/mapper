So we're told the square below represents one whole, so this entire square is a whole, and then they ask us what percent is represented by the shaded area. So why don't you pause this video and see if you can figure that out. So let's see, the whole is divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 equal sections, of which one, two, three, four, five, six, seven are actually filled in, that's the shaded area. So one way to think about it is seven tenths are shaded in. But how do we express this fraction as a percent? They're asking for a percent. Well remember, per cent, it literally means per hundred, cent, same root as the word hundred, you see it in cents or century. And so can we write this as per hundred instead of per 10? Well seven per 10 is the same thing as 70 per hundred, or 70 percent. And how did I go from seven tenths to 70 over 100? Well I just multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10. And once you do more and more per cent, you'll get a hang of it, you say oh seven tenths, that's the same thing as 70 per hundred, which is 70 percent. Let's do another example. Here we're told 100 percent is shown on the following tape diagram. So just this amount right over here is 100 percent. And then they ask us what percent is represented by the entire tape diagram? So by this entire thing right over here. Pause this video and see if you can answer that. Well one way to think about 100 percent, 100 percent is equivalent to a whole. And now we have three times as much of that for the entire tape diagram. So you could view this as three wholes, or you could say that's 100 percent, we have another 100 percent right over here, and then we have another 100 percent right over here. So the whole tape diagram, that would be 300 percent. Let's do another example, this is strangely fun. All right, okay, and I'll see, it says the large rectangle below represents one whole. All right, so that's this whole thing is one whole. What percentage is represented by the shaded area? So pause the video and see if you can figure that out again. So let's just express it as a fraction first. So we have a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 squares. So out of those 20 squares, we see that six of them are actually shaded in. So six 20ths, can we write that as per 100? Well, let's see. To go from 20 to 100, I multiply by five. And so if I multiply, so if I multiply the numerator by five, I'll get the same value, six times five is 30. So six per 20 is the same thing as 30 per 100, which is the same thing as 30 per cent, which literally means per 100. So this is 30%. Let's do one last example. Here we are told, each large rectangle below represents one whole. So this is a whole, and then this whole thing right over here is another whole. What percentage is represented by the shaded area? Again, pause the video, see if you can answer that. So this one, we have shaded in a whole, so that is 100%. And then over here, we have shaded in one, two, three, four, fifths of the whole. So four fifths, if I wanted to express it as per 100, what would it be? Well, five times 20 is 100, so four times 20 is 80. So four fifths, or 80 hundredths, is filled out here, or you could say 80 per 100, which is the same thing as 80%. So this right over here is 80%. So what percent is represented by the shaded area? Well, we have 100%, and then we have 80%, so we have 180%. It's more than a whole. If you have a percentage that is larger than 100%, you're talking about something that is more than a whole, and then we see that. We have a whole right over here, and then we have 80% more than that.
