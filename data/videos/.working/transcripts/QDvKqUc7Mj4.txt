Whereas to move the orange dot to the number that equals five times one third. Alright, so one way to think about it, we just have to move one third five times. So let's do it once, so that's gonna be one third. You do it twice, you get to two thirds. You do it three times, you get to three thirds. Four times, you get to four thirds. Five times, you get to five thirds. Five times one third is gonna be five thirds. Or you could say five one thirds, which is the same thing as five thirds. Hopefully that makes some sense. Let's do some more examples here. So let's say we need to figure out, so let's say it says move the orange dot to the number that equals two times four thirds. Alright, so one times four thirds is, one times four thirds is just gonna get us to four thirds. And then if we have another four thirds, we're gonna add four thirds to that. So we're gonna move another four thirds to the right. So four thirds plus four thirds would get us to eight thirds. Eight thirds, I'm having trouble moving this, eight thirds. So one times four thirds is just four thirds. And then two times four thirds is eight thirds. And notice, that's the same thing as two times four, which is eight over three, eight thirds. Let's do one more of these. So move the orange dot to the number that equals three times three halves. So this is going to be zero halves, that's just zero. So that's zero, you could do that as zero times three halves. One times three halves, well that will just get us to three halves. Two times three halves, we'll add another three halves. So that'll get us to six halves. And then three times three halves, we'll add another three halves. That gets us to nine halves. And we're done.
