What number can you add to x squared minus 6x to complete the perfect square trinomial? So a trinomial is just a polynomial with three terms. So right now we have two terms. So they're essentially saying, can we add a term here, essentially a number, a constant, so that this becomes a perfect square? The expression, once it becomes a trinomial, becomes a perfect square. So let me just rewrite it here. x squared minus 6x. So we're going to add something right over here so that the entire expression can be a perfect square, a perfect square of a binomial. And to think about that, let's think about what a perfect square would look like. And so let's imagine if we had something like x plus a squared. What would that look like if we were to expand it out? Let me do this in another color to show you that this is kind of a little bit of a side note. So let me do it in blue. So if I had x plus some constant a squared, well this is the same thing as x plus a times x plus a. And this is the same thing as, you might remember this pattern, or we'll just multiply it out. We'll just multiply every term here by every term here. So x times x is x squared. Then x times a is ax. Then a times x is ax. Then we have a times a is a squared. And that all just comes out of doing the distributive property twice. Or you could think of it as foil if you find that a little bit easier, although that's a little bit more mechanical. And this gives you x squared plus 2 ax plus a squared. So if you have a trinomial in this form, it's a perfect square. And it can be factored into x plus a squared. And we see the pattern here, both in this case and in this case, the coefficient on the x squared term is 1. And then we see whatever the coefficient here is on the first degree term, on the x. Whatever that coefficient is, if we take half of that number and square it, and make that the constant, then this will be a perfect square. For example, half of 2a is a, and we're squaring a right over here, and that makes this a perfect square. So let's do the exact same thing with our binomial, soon to be a trinomial. Let's look at the first degree coefficient. It is a negative 6. You could view this right over here as our 2a. And so what is half of this? Or another way to think of it is 2a is equal to negative 6, if we just pattern match right over here. So what would a be? a would be equal to negative 3. And so if we added a squared to this expression right here, it would be a perfect square. So we literally just took half of this, which is negative 3, and then we're going to square it. So the second squared is positive 9. So this right over here is just a squared. Notice, I called this 2a, I took half of it to figure out what a is, and I squared it to get this 9 here. So I just took negative 6 divided by 2 is negative 3, squared it, got 9. And if you wanted to factor this out, we have x squared minus 6x plus 9. So what two numbers, when you take their product, you get 9, and when you add them together, you get negative 6, well, negative 3 and negative 3. So this is going to be x minus 3 times x minus 3, or you could think of it as x minus 3 squared. So it is a perfect square trinomial.
