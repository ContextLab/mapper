We've had so many impressive responses to the challenges, to the few challenges we've put out there, that we, to some degree, want to see if we can just have more people creating and putting out ideas and kind of taking ourselves out of the equation. And so what we've set up here is a little Google moderator. The link is here. I'll also make an annotation to this video that you can click on. And I'll put the link in the description of this video. And the general idea here is for anyone to go to this Google moderator thing, put ideas up for computer science projects or for programming projects. And other people can vote them up or down based on how badly they want someone to work on this. And then if you are able to build one of these things, you can post a response and put your link to the thing that you actually created. And so I've already populated with a few things that I would like to see. But we should just all vote for whatever we all want to see the most and see what people create. And I'm really excited to see what might happen here.
