        "B": "A firing rate model represents each neuron's output as a continuous variable (average spike rate) rather than individual spikes, assuming the relevant information is carried by rate, not precise spike timing. This is appropriate when the population is large and temporal dynamics of interest are slower than individual inter-spike intervals",

        "A": "The leaky integrate-and-fire model is actually more complex than Hodgkin-Huxley, incorporating additional ion channel types including calcium-activated potassium channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, and persistent sodium conductances that produce a richer repertoire of firing patterns including bursting, adaptation, and plateau potentials not captured by the four-variable Hodgkin-Huxley formalism",
        "B": "LIF models do not produce any output spikes at all and compute only continuously varying subthreshold membrane potential trajectories without any threshold mechanism or reset rule, making them fundamentally incapable of generating the discrete all-or-nothing spike events that are necessary for communicating information to downstream neurons through conventional chemical synaptic transmission or for driving spike-timing-dependent plasticity",
        "C": "The leaky integrate-and-fire model and the Hodgkin-Huxley model are mathematically identical formulations that produce exactly the same voltage trajectories, spike shapes, firing rates, and dynamical behaviors for all possible input currents — the LIF designation is simply an alternative name for the Hodgkin-Huxley equations used in certain computational neuroscience textbooks",
        "D": "LIF replaces the detailed voltage-dependent conductance dynamics with a single linear differential equation for membrane voltage (τ·dV/dt = -(V-Vrest) + R·I) plus a threshold-and-reset rule: when V reaches threshold, a spike is recorded and V is reset.

        "A": "If the presynaptic spike precedes the postsynaptic spike (pre-before-post), the synapse strengthens (LTP); if post-before-pre, it weakens (LTD). The magnitude depends on the time difference, decaying exponentially. This temporal asymmetry allows synapses to detect and reinforce causal relationships — inputs that consistently drive the postsynaptic cell are strengthened, while those that arrive too late are weakened",
        "B": "STDP strengthens all synaptic connections uniformly regardless of the relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes",
        "C": "STDP weakens synaptic connections specifically when presynaptic spikes precede postsynaptic spikes within a narrow time window of approximately twenty milliseconds, and strengthens connections when the temporal order is reversed",
        "D": "STDP operates on a timescale of several hours to days, requiring sustained correlated activity over many thousands of spike pairings before any detectable change in synaptic efficacy occurs, making it far too slow to contribute to the fast synaptic modifications required for real-time perceptual learning, motor adaptation, or rapid associative memory formation during single behavioral episodes lasting seconds to minutes"

        "B": "Memories are stored as stable fixed-point attractors of the network dynamics, encoded in the symmetric weight matrix via a Hebbian-like outer product rule (w_ij = Σ ξᵢᵘ·ξⱼᵘ). Retrieval is content-addressable: presenting a partial or noisy cue initializes the network near the correct attractor, and the dynamics converge to the stored pattern, implementing pattern completion",
        "C": "Memories in a Hopfield network are stored in individual neurons using a grandmother cell coding scheme, with each memory represented by the activation of exactly one dedicated neuron, meaning the network's storage capacity is limited to the total number of neurons and each memory occupies a single cell rather than being distributed across the synaptic weight matrix that connects all neurons in the network",
        "D": "Memories in a Hopfield network are stored only temporarily and decay within milliseconds after presentation because the network dynamics are purely dissipative with no stable attractor states, meaning there is no mechanism for sustained maintenance of stored patterns once the external input is removed and the network relaxes back to a homogeneous resting state through exponential decay of all neural activity"

Information is decoded using methods like population vector averaging (Georgopoulos et al. 1986), maximum likelihood estimation, or Bayesian decoding. The Fisher information in a population scales with the number of neurons, allowing population accuracy to exceed any individual neuron's precision",

        "C": "Mutual information is a purely abstract mathematical tool developed for engineering telecommunications systems that has no relevance or applicability to the analysis of actual neural coding in biological nervous systems, because the assumptions underlying Shannon's information theory — discrete symbol alphabets, stationary ergodic processes, and memoryless channels — are fundamentally violated by biological neural systems",

        "C": "Efficient coding predicts that neural response distributions should be adapted to the statistics of natural stimuli — specifically, neurons should allocate more coding capacity to frequently occurring stimulus features.

        "A": "Low-dimensional manifolds discovered through dimensionality reduction of neural population recordings mean that the vast majority of individual neurons recorded in these populations are completely inactive and functionally unnecessary, contributing no information to the population code — the low dimensionality directly implies that only a small handful of neurons are actually firing while all others remain silent, and the manifold structure is simply an artifact of recording from a small active subset embedded within a much larger population of non-functional neurons that could be removed without any impact on the circuit's computational output or behavioral performance in the task being studied",
