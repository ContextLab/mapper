We're told this fall Ella baked 12 muffins and two times as many cookies for a school craft fair. Next fall, she plans to bake three times as many muffins and five times as many cookies to meet higher demand. How many totaled baked goods does Ella plan to make next fall? Pause this video and try to do this yourself before we do this together. Okay, so now let's do this together. There's two things that she's baking. She's baking cookies, actually let me start with the muffins because that's the first thing they mentioned. She's baking muffins and I'll do it in another color and she's baking cookies. And then there is this fall, there is this fall, and then there is next fall, next fall. So this fall, we know that Ella baked 12 muffins. So 12 muffins and two times as many cookies. Two times as many cookies. So how many cookies is that going to be? Well, it's going to be 12 times two because it's two times as many. So this is going to be 24 cookies. Now next fall, she plans to bake three times as many muffins. Three times as many muffins. So let's see, that's going to be three times 12, three times 12, which is equal to 36 muffins next fall. And five times as many cookies to meet higher demand. So it's going to be five times the number of cookies that she made and to be very clear, they could have said five times as many cookies as she made in the fall, but I think that's somewhat there. So let's see, so five times as many cookies the next year. So then that is five times the amount that she is going to make this fall. So five times 24. And this is going to be the same thing. If you might be able to do this in your head or you might say this is the same thing as five times 20 plus four, which is going to be the same thing as five times 20. I'm just doing the distributive property here. Five times 20 plus five times four. Five times four, which is going to be equal to 100 and adding the dot 20. This is going to be equal to 120. So then if you were add up the total to bake goods, Ella plans to make next fall, total bake goods for next fall. That's going to be the number of muffins plus the number of cookies. So it's going to be 120 plus 36, which is equal to, you could add this up and you'd get 156, zero plus six is six, two plus three is five, and then you bring down that hundred. So we have 156 total baked goods next fall.
