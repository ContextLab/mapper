We're told to use partial products to multiply 67 times nine. And so they wrote 67 times nine here and they broke out some of the steps. And so let's just think about what's happening. It looks like step one, we're doing a partial product of nine times something. And then step two, we have another partial product of nine times 60. So this right over here, the nine times 60, which is equal to 540, that's when essentially you took the nine and you multiplied it times the six tens right over there. So that's nine times the 60. So step one, the way you could think about it is, this is going to be nine times the ones place. So this is going to be nine times seven. And what is nine times seven? That is going to be 63. And so if you take nine times seven and you add that to nine times 60, well, then you're going to get what nine times 67 is. And so let's add all of this together. Three plus zero is three. Six plus four is 10. We can write a zero there and regroup that one. And then 100 plus 500 is 600. So that is 603, or you might recognize 540 plus 63, 540 plus 60 is 600 plus another three is 603. And we're done.
