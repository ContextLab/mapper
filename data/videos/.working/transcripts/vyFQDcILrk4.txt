Four plus one is... 16. Hi, teachers. Sal Khan here from Khan Academy, and I just wanted to make sure that when congratulations are being passed around, that we take the time to say congratulations and thank you to teachers for all of the amazing work that they do. Congratulations for getting another group of students forward in their life. And I always say, if I had to pick between an amazing teacher or amazing technology, I would pick the amazing teacher every single time. But in times where we're having to lean a little bit more on the screen, I think it only highlights that much more how invaluable the human element is, how invaluable the work that you do to motivate students, unblock them, and form those human connections are valuable not just for learning the academic material, but for making them stronger, more resilient, and better human beings. So thank you so much, all of you teachers, in this graduation time for all of the incredible work you do day in, day out.
