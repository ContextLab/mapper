The strong law is strictly stronger — it guarantees that the sequence of sample means actually converges along almost every sample path, not just that deviations become unlikely",

        "A": "Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability equals the prior probability divided by the marginal likelihood, without any contribution from the likelihood function. This means that prior beliefs alone determine the posterior, and observed data plays no role in updating the probability of a hypothesis. The formula is simply P(H|E) = P(H)/P(E), which shows that evidence affects only the normalization constant",

The posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E equals the likelihood of E given H, times the prior probability of H, divided by the marginal probability of E. This formalizes how rational belief updating should work: the prior P(H) represents beliefs before seeing data, and the posterior P(H|E) represents updated beliefs after seeing data",

In reality, the p-value measures the proportion of the sample that deviates from the null hypothesis prediction, which means that a smaller p-value indicates a larger fraction of observations are inconsistent with randomness. This fraction-based interpretation leads researchers to treat the p-value as a direct measure of how reproducible a finding will be across future experiments, when it is actually the percentage of discordant data points",
        "B": "The most common misinterpretation is confusing statistical significance with practical significance — a small p-value means the effect is large enough to matter in real-world applications. Researchers frequently assume that if p < 0.05, the treatment or intervention has a meaningful practical effect size, when in fact with large enough sample sizes even trivially small effects that have no real-world importance produce extremely small p-values. The p-value only measures whether an effect is nonzero, not whether the magnitude of that effect has any practical consequence for decision-making",
        "C": "The most common misinterpretation is that the p-value represents the probability that the experimental results were produced by a flaw in the study design such as selection bias, measurement error, or confounding variables rather than by a genuine effect. Under this incorrect reading, a low p-value supposedly rules out all methodological threats to validity. In truth, the p-value assumes the statistical model is correct and cannot detect violations of its own assumptions, so it provides no information about whether the data were collected or analyzed properly",

It is actually P(data this extreme | H₀ is true) — the probability of the data given the null. These are not the same (inverting the conditional). A small p-value means the data are unlikely under H₀, not that H₀ is unlikely to be true. Determining P(H₀|data) requires Bayes' theorem and a prior probability for H₀"

It fails when: the likelihood is multimodal (convergence to local maxima), the parameter is on the boundary (regularity violated), or the model is misspecified",

        "C": "Under regularity conditions, the MLE is asymptotically normally distributed but converges at the rate n^{-1/3} rather than the standard n^{-1/2} rate, which means it requires substantially larger sample sizes than method-of-moments estimators to achieve comparable precision for most parametric families",

When the model is misspecified, the MLE converges to the parameter value that minimizes the KL divergence, but the resulting estimator is neither consistent nor asymptotically normal.

Once the interval is calculated from the data, the parameter is either inside it or not, but we can assign a 95% posterior probability to it being inside because the interval was constructed using a procedure that accounts for sampling variability. This probabilistic interpretation is valid because the endpoints of the interval are random variables whose distribution encompasses the true parameter value 95% of the time",
        "B": "If we repeated the experiment many times and computed a 95% CI each time, 95% of those intervals would contain the true parameter value. Any particular interval either contains the true parameter or does not — the probability statement is about the procedure, not about any single interval. This frequentist interpretation contrasts with Bayesian credible intervals, where P(θ ∈ CI | data) = 0.95 is a valid statement because θ is treated as a random variable with a posterior distribution",
        "C": "A 95% confidence interval captures 95% of the individual data points in the sample, serving as a range within which most future observations from the same population would fall. This makes the CI essentially identical to a prediction interval, where a wider interval indicates greater dispersion of individual values around the central estimate.

Periodicity and reducibility are irrelevant to convergence — these properties only affect the speed of convergence, not whether convergence occurs. Even chains with absorbing states or disconnected components will converge, since the transition matrix raised to a sufficiently large power always approaches a matrix with identical rows representing the stationary distribution",

This uniformity condition ensures that no state is preferred over any other in the long run, so the chain settles into a uniform distribution over all states. Non-uniform transition matrices cannot have stationary distributions because the asymmetry in transition rates creates persistent oscillations that prevent the chain from reaching equilibrium",

In continuous state spaces, the chain can move infinitesimally between states, smoothing out the periodic behavior that discrete jumps create.

When testing against a non-normal reference distribution, the critical values are invalid and the test produces systematically inflated Type I error rates. This fundamental limitation is why the KS test is considered essentially redundant with the Shapiro-Wilk normality test — both assess normality, but the Shapiro-Wilk test is strictly more powerful because it exploits the specific structure of the normal distribution rather than comparing generic cumulative distribution functions through a supremum distance metric",

Its main limitation is low power against differences in the tails, since the supremum is most sensitive near the median where the CDF is steepest, and it has less power than parametric tests when distributional assumptions are met",

        "A": "There is no meaningful difference between Bayesian and frequentist statistics — both frameworks always produce identical point estimates, confidence/credible intervals, and hypothesis test conclusions when applied to the same data. The apparent differences are purely philosophical and have no practical consequences for data analysis. Any Bayesian analysis can be exactly replicated by a frequentist procedure through appropriate choice of test statistic and rejection region, and conversely any frequentist procedure corresponds to a Bayesian analysis with some implicit prior distribution. The distinction persists in textbooks only for historical reasons, as the mathematical equivalence between the two approaches was definitively proven by Lindley's theorem in the 1950s",
        "B": "Bayesian statistics was the dominant framework throughout the 19th century but has been conclusively shown to be logically incoherent by frequentist critiques, particularly the problem of prior sensitivity. Because different prior distributions lead to different posterior conclusions, Bayesian inference introduces unavoidable subjectivity that makes scientific results non-reproducible. The frequentist framework resolves this by basing all inference on the sampling distribution of test statistics, which depends only on the data and the assumed model. Modern computational advances such as MCMC have made Bayesian calculations feasible, but this computational convenience does not address the fundamental logical flaw of requiring prior specification that influences the final conclusions in ways that cannot be objectively validated",
        "C": "Frequentist statistics works optimally with small samples because its exact tests, such as Fisher's exact test and the exact binomial test, make no asymptotic approximations. Bayesian statistics works only with large samples because the posterior distribution converges to the true parameter value only as the sample size approaches infinity, via the Bernstein-von Mises theorem. With small samples, the Bayesian posterior is dominated by the prior and provides unreliable inferences. This complementarity means that researchers should use frequentist methods when data are scarce and switch to Bayesian methods only when hundreds or thousands of observations are available, which is the opposite of common practice in fields like clinical trials and psychometrics",
        "D": "The core difference is the interpretation of probability: frequentists define probability as long-run frequency (parameters are fixed but unknown, data are random), while Bayesians define probability as degree of belief (parameters have probability distributions reflecting uncertainty). In practice, this matters: Bayesian methods naturally incorporate prior information, provide posterior distributions (not just point estimates), and answer the question 'what do I believe about the parameter given the data?' while frequentist methods answer 'how would this procedure perform if repeated many times?' With informative priors and small samples, results can differ substantially; with vague priors and large samples, they typically agree"

      "options": {
        "A": "FDR and FWER are identical concepts that use different notation but control exactly the same error rate. Both the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure divide the significance level α by the number of tests m, producing the same adjusted threshold for declaring significance. The only difference is computational: the Bonferroni method uses a simple division α/m while the BH procedure sorts p-values and compares each to a linearly increasing threshold, but these two approaches always agree on which null hypotheses to reject. Claims that FDR is less conservative than FWER are based on simulations that used incorrect implementations of the Bonferroni correction, and properly implemented Bonferroni controls are equally powerful as BH for any configuration of true and false null hypotheses",
        "B": "Multiple testing corrections are unnecessary in modern statistics because the original significance threshold of α = 0.05 already accounts for the possibility of conducting multiple tests. The 5% error rate is a per-experiment rate, not a per-test rate, meaning that as long as all tests are conducted within a single study, the overall false positive rate remains at 5% regardless of how many tests are performed. This is a consequence of the closure principle in hypothesis testing, which guarantees that the familywise error rate of a collection of tests never exceeds the nominal level of each individual test when the tests are performed on the same dataset. Corrections like Bonferroni and BH are therefore overly conservative and substantially reduce statistical power without providing any additional error control",
        "C": "FWER (Bonferroni) controls P(≥1 false positive among all tests), becoming extremely conservative as the number of tests grows (dividing α by m). FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg, 1995) instead controls E[false positives / total positives] — the expected proportion of false discoveries among rejected hypotheses. This is less conservative because it allows some false positives as long as they are a controlled fraction of discoveries. For genomics (testing 20,000+ genes), Bonferroni gives virtually no discoveries, while BH at FDR = 0.05 identifies hundreds of plausible candidates. FDR control was a breakthrough because it matched the scientific goal: controlling the quality of a list of discoveries, not eliminating all errors",
        "D": "FWER control is always preferable to FDR control in every application because controlling the probability of at least one false positive is the only scientifically meaningful error criterion. FDR control allows a specified proportion of rejections to be false positives, which means that published results using FDR corrections contain a known fraction of incorrect findings that have been deliberately accepted as false. This undermines scientific credibility because readers cannot determine which specific results are true and which are the accepted false positives. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure gained popularity only because it produces more significant results, not because it provides better error control, making it a form of statistical p-hacking disguised as a principled correction"

The Rubin causal model and the do-calculus of Pearl both attempt to define causal quantities mathematically, but these definitions are circular because they presuppose the existence of causal relationships in order to define them. Randomized controlled trials are better than observational studies for establishing association but still cannot establish causation, as the assignment mechanism eliminates confounding but does not create a causal link. The apparent success of causal inference in medicine and social science reflects consistent patterns of strong association rather than true identification of causal mechanisms, which remain forever beyond the reach of statistical methodology",

The individual causal effect Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) is therefore unobservable. We can only estimate average causal effects (ATE = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]) under assumptions: randomization (ensures independence of treatment and potential outcomes), SUTVA (no interference between units), and positivity (nonzero probability of each treatment for all covariate levels). When randomization fails, methods like propensity score matching, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity attempt to recover causal effects from observational data under additional assumptions",
        "C": "The fundamental problem of causal inference is that observational studies always have insufficient sample sizes to detect true causal effects, because confounding variables introduce additional sources of variation that inflate the standard errors of treatment effect estimates. This means that no observational study can ever have enough statistical power to distinguish a genuine causal effect from a spurious correlation produced by unmeasured confounders, regardless of the study design or analytical method employed. Instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences all attempt to address this power problem by effectively increasing the usable sample size through quasi-experimental variation, but they remain fundamentally limited by the finite number of observations that are available in practice",

This means even when the true covariance is identity (no structure), sample eigenvalues are spread over a wide interval, with the largest eigenvalue approaching (1+√γ)².

This Gaussianity requirement is the primary reason that random matrix theory has limited practical applicability in statistics — most real-world data are not normally distributed, so the Marchenko-Pastur distribution does not describe their sample covariance eigenvalue distributions, and corrections for non-normality require knowledge of the fourth cumulant of the data distribution"

The jumps occur at a rate proportional to the diffusion coefficient, and between jumps the process remains constant. The apparent continuity of Brownian motion observed in physical diffusion experiments is an illusion created by the high frequency of small jumps, which makes the path look continuous at macroscopic scales.

        "B": "Brownian motion is a deterministic process whose sample paths are smooth, infinitely differentiable functions of time. The apparent randomness observed in diffusion phenomena is due to our inability to measure the initial conditions of all particles precisely — if we could specify the exact position and velocity of every molecule, the trajectory would be perfectly predictable from Newton's laws. This perspective, known as the Langevin interpretation, shows that Brownian motion is fundamentally a classical mechanical phenomenon dressed in probabilistic language for computational convenience. The Wiener measure on path space is therefore not a genuine probability measure but an approximation to the deterministic dynamics of the underlying molecular system",

The mathematical formalization by Einstein and Wiener was specific to this physical context, and the process has no applications outside of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Claims that Brownian motion is relevant to financial mathematics, signal processing, or abstract probability theory are based on superficial analogies rather than rigorous mathematical connections.
