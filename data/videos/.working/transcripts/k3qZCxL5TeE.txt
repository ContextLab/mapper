Arrange the digits 2, 6, 0, and 1 so that you create the highest possible four-digit number. So the way I like to think about it is, if I'm trying to create as large of a number as possible, I want to put the largest digits or the largest numbers in the largest place value. So if it's a four-digit number, so it's 1, 2, 3, 4-digit number, whatever I put here, this is going to represent thousands, whatever I put here is going to represent hundreds, whatever I put here represents tens, and whatever I put here represents ones. So I want to maximize the number of thousands I have. For example, the largest number here is 6. I could make it 6,000, I could make it 600, I could make it 60, or I could make it 6. Well, if I want as large number as possible, I'm going to make it 6,000. Notice, if I put any other number in that place value, if I put 0 there, I'd have no thousands. If I put 2 there, I'd only have 2,000. If I put 1 there, I'd only have 1,000. 6,000 is definitely going to be bigger than any of the numbers that could be constructed with a 2, 0, or 1 in the thousands place. Now, the exact same logic, we want the next largest number in the hundreds place. So the next largest number here is a 2. So I'm going to put a 2 right over here. I'd rather have 200s than 0 hundreds or 100s. That's going to make it bigger. Then, same exact idea, we want the next largest number in the tens place. I'd rather have 110 than 0 10, and then we're just left with the 0. So we're just going to put the 0 right over here. So we can make 6,210. If I wanted to make the smallest possible 4-digit number, then I would rearrange this. I have the smallest possible number in the thousands and the largest possible number in the ones. So the smallest possible number I could create is 0 6. I'm going to be careful. 0 1 2 6. So the smallest possible number, if I just switched this around, would be 126 that I could construct out of these digits. But this is what they asked for. So I'm going to put 6,210.
