Let's write 113.9% as a decimal. So, percent, this symbol right over here, literally means per hundred. So this is the same thing as 113.9 per hundred, which is the same thing as 113.9 divided by 100. So essentially, if we want to write this as a decimal, we just take 113.9 and we divide it by 100. And to do that, 113.9 divided by 100. If you divide by 10, you move the decimal once to the left. If you divide by 100, you're moving the decimal twice to the left. If we were doing it by 1,000, we would go to the left once more, 10,000. Each time you divide by 10, you'd go one step to the left, which hopefully makes sense. If you were to multiply by 10, we would be moving the decimal over to the right. And there are other videos that go into far more depth than the intuition behind that. But anyway, we're dividing 113.9 by 100, so move the decimal two spaces to the left, so the decimal will end up right over here. So this will be equal to 1.139. And we are done.
