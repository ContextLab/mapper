So let's see if we can find the Maclaurin series representation of f of x, where f of x is equal to x to the third times cosine of x squared. I encourage you to pause the video and now try to do it. Remember, the Maclaurin series is just the Taylor series centered at zero. And let's say our goal here is the first five non-zero terms of the Maclaurin series representation, or Maclaurin series approximation of this. So I'm assuming you had paused the video and you had attempted to do this, and there's a good chance that you might have gotten quite frustrated when you did this, because in order to find a Taylor series, Maclaurin series, we need to find the derivatives of this function, and as soon as you start to do that, it starts to get painful. F prime of x is going to be, let's see, product rules. So it's three x squared times cosine of x squared plus x to the third times the derivative of this thing, which is going to be two x times negative sine of x, negative sine of x squared. So just that was pretty painful, but it's only gonna get more and more painful as we take the second and third and fourth derivatives. We might have to take more because some of these terms might end up being zeros, because we want the first five non-zero terms. So the second derivative, this is going to be painful. This is going to be painful, and then the third and fourth derivatives are gonna be even more painful. So what do we do here? You could just do this, and just evaluate them each at zero and then use those for our coefficients, but you're probably guessing correctly that there's an easier way to do this, and I will give you a hint. We know what the Maclaurin series for cosine of x is. We've done that in a previous video. If you wanna see that again, there's another video. Look up cosine Taylor series at zero on Khan Academy, and you'll find that, but we already know from that, this is one of the most famous Maclaurin series. We know this, let's just say g of x. Let's say g of x is equal to cosine of x. Well, we know what this is like. The Maclaurin series approximation of that, it's going to be one minus x squared over two factorial, plus x to the fourth over four factorial minus x to the sixth over six factorial plus, and I could keep going on and on and on. You kind of see where this is going, plus x to the eighth over eight factorial, and it just keeps going minus plus on and on and on and on. But we wanted first eight, five terms, so this is a start, and I know we wanted the first five terms of this thing, but bear with me. We'll see how this thing right over here is going to be useful. So now that I've given you a little bit of reminder on the Maclaurin series representation of cosine of x, my hint to you is can we use this to find the Maclaurin series representation of this right up here? And remember, all this is, this is x to the third times, and I'm just rereading it for you, this is x to the third times g of x squared. So that's a sizable hint. I encourage you to pause the video again and see if you can work through this. So let me rewrite, I'm assuming you had a go at it. So let me rewrite what I just wrote. So I just told you that g of x, or f of x, f of x, if I wanted to write it as, I guess you could say, as a function or if I want to construct it using g of x, I could rewrite it as x to the third times, instead of cosine of x squared, that's the same thing as g of x squared. So x to the third times g, g of x squared. G of x squared. This g of x is just cosine, g of x squared is gonna be cosine of x squared, and you're gonna multiply that times x to the third. Well, can't we just apply this insight to the approximation? And you might be asking that question. And my answer to you is yes, you absolutely can. And notice, when you substitute your x's for x squared, you'll just get another polynomial. And if you multiply that by x to the third, you're just gonna get another polynomial. And that actually will be the Maclaurin series representation of what we started off with. We actually will get the Maclaurin series representation of this thing right over here. So we could say that f of x is approximately equal to x to the third times, x to the third times, let me give myself some space right over here. So g of x squared. So over here, this is approximation for g of x. And if we kept going on and on forever, it would be a representation of g of x. So every place where we see an x, let's replace it with an x squared. So this is going to be one minus, so x squared squared is x to the fourth, x to the fourth over two factorial, which is really just two. But I like to put the factorial there because you see the pattern. Plus, if our x is now x squared, x squared to the fourth power is x to the eighth, x to the eighth power over four factorial, minus x squared to the sixth power is x to the 12th over six factorial. And then plus x squared to the eighth is x to the 16th power over eight factorial. And of course we can keep going on and on and on minus plus. We care about the first five terms, non-zero terms, and we're saying this is an approximation anyway. And so we can say that this is going to be approximately equal to, we distribute the x to the third, and I'm gonna do it in magenta just for fun. So distribute the x to the third, we get x to the third minus x to the seventh over two factorial plus x to the 11th over four factorial minus x to the 15th over six factorial plus x to the 19th x to the 19th over eight factorial. So that's the first five, nine, zero terms, and we are done. And when you actually see what we got, you realize it would have taken you forever to do this by, I guess you could say, by brute force. Because you would have had to find the 19th derivative of all of this madness. But when you realize that, hey gee, if I can just re-express this function as essentially a x to a power times something that I know the Maclaurin series of, especially, well, if you view it this way, if I can write, if I can rewrite, let me say it in a less confusing way, if I can rewrite my function, so it is equal to some, actually I can even throw a coefficient here, if it's equal to some a x to the n power times some function, let me just send a new color, times, purple, times g of b, b x to some other power, where I can fairly easily, without too much computation, maybe I already even know, if I know the Maclaurin series representation of g of x, if I know what g of x is gonna be, then I can do exactly what I did just in this video. I find the Maclaurin series representation for g, every place where I saw an x, I replace it with what I have over here, the b x to the m power, where m is some exponent, that will give me another polynomial, another power series, and then I multiply it times a x to the n, and that's gonna once again give me another power series, and that will be the power series for my original function. Very exciting.
