we are asked to find the missing value. And they give us a hint, use the number line to find the missing value. And let's see, they say four plus something is equal to negative six. So why don't you pause this video and see if you can work through this before we do it ourselves. All right, so let's just start at four. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. We could just say, where is four on the number line? Four is here, one, two, three, four. We're going to start there and we're going to add something to that four to get us to negative six, to get us right there. So what are we going to add? Well, we're going to be moving to the left. So we're going to be adding a negative number right over here. And we can see what that negative number is going to be. How many units do we have to move to the left? We have to move one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 to the left. So what do we add if we want to move 10 to the left? We have to add a negative 10. So this is negative 10 right over here. Another way to think about it, if you're four to the right of zero, well, it's going to take you four just to get back to zero. That's four there. And it's going to take you another six to get you to negative six. And then of course you're moving to the left. So that's going to be a negative 10. Let's do another example. So let me scroll down a bit so we can see that second example. So once again, find the missing value and pause this video again and try to work that out. All right, so there's a couple of ways we could think about it. We're saying negative three is equal to something plus five. So let's just see where negative three is on this number line. Negative three is right over there. And something plus five is going to be equal to negative three. So plus five, you could view it as you're going to start someplace and you're going to move five units to the right, something like that to get to where you end up. So where could we start to get five units to the right and be at negative three? Well, if we just go five units to the left, so one, two, three, four, five, if you start from this point and you were to add five, you were to get to negative three. And so what is this point right over here? Well, this right over here, let's see, this is negative five, negative six, negative seven, negative eight. So we have negative eight plus five is equal to negative three. Another way to think about it is you could have used a commutative property to say, hey, instead of blank plus five, you could say this is negative three is equal to five plus blank. And so you could say, let's start at five. Let me just send another color. Let's start at five. And then what would I have to add to it to get to negative three? And so, well, I would have to move to the left, five, and then three in order to get to negative three. So you would essentially have to add negative eight. So that's another way that you could think about that.
