Brooklyn purchased three pounds of pasta and 12 ounces of cheese to make macaroni and cheese. What is the total weight in ounces, total weight in ounces of the pasta and cheese combined? So they give us the weight of the pasta in pounds and they give us the weight of the cheese in ounces. And we want to add the total weight, but they have to all be in ounces. So let's first convert these three pounds of pasta into a certain amount of ounces of pasta. So we already know that one pound is equal to 16 ounces. They tell us that. So what would three pounds be? So if I had three pounds, how many ounces would that be? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Well let's see, if you're having three times the pounds, you're also going to have three times the ounces. So if one pound is 16 ounces, if you have three times as many pounds, you're gonna have three times as many ounces. So 16 times three is 48 ounces. So Brooklyn, the three pounds of pasta that she purchased, that can also be viewed as 48 ounces of pasta. So she has 48 ounces of pasta and 12 ounces of cheese. So what is the total weight in ounces of them combined? Well it's going to be 48 ounces, 48 ounces, plus the 12 ounces of cheese. 48 ounces of pasta plus 12 ounces of cheese give us a total of 60 ounces of pasta and cheese combined. Let's do another example with other units. So we are told David is making a wall out of bricks. Each brick is 2 thirds of a foot long. Each brick is 2 thirds of a foot long. There are 20 bricks lined up end to end to make the wall. What is the total length of the wall in inches? We gotta pay attention to the units. So they give us the length of each brick in feet. So we know that each brick here, let me draw a brick, the length here is 2 thirds of a foot. 2 thirds of a foot. So what would this length be in inches? Well once again we can look at the conversion between foot and inches. If I go from one foot to 2 thirds of a foot, well I've multiplied by 2 thirds. So if one foot is 12 inches and if I wanna know how many inches 2 thirds inches, or 2 thirds of a foot is in inches, well I would multiply by 2 thirds again. In either case you could view this as multiplying both sides of this conversion by 2 thirds. And so 2 thirds of a foot is going to be 2 thirds times 12 inches. And so 12 times 2 over 3. That would be 24 over 3. So this is going to be equal to 24 over 3 inches. I'll just write IN for short right over here. 24 over 3 which is equal to 8 inches. So each brick is either, you could either view it as 2 thirds of a foot long, or you could view it as 8 inches. 8 inches long. And there are 20 bricks lined up end to end to make the wall. So what is the total length of the wall in inches? Well it's gonna be 8 brick, each brick is 8 inches times 20. Times 20. And 8 times 2 is 16, so 8 times 20 is 160 inches. Let's do one more of these. And this time let's deal with some volume. So this says Blanca buys 2 gallons of green paint. She uses 5 quarts to paint her front porch and 0.5 quarts to paint the front porch swing. How many quarts of paint does Blanca have left? So we're given the original mountain gallons, but we wanna know how many quarts she has left. So let's convert the amount she originally has into quarts. So they tell us 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So 2 gallons, 2 gallons is going to be equal to, 2 gallons is going to be twice as many quarts. It's gonna be 8 quarts. So that's what she starts with. And one way to think about this, I just took this conversion. Well if I'm gonna have twice as many gallons, then I'm gonna have twice as many quarts if I wanna express that volume in quarts. So one way of thinking about it, she starts with 8 quarts. She starts with 8 quarts, 8 quarts. She uses 5 quarts to paint her front porch. So minus 5 quarts on the front porch is what she used. And she used 0.5 quarts to paint the porch swing. So minus 0.5 quarts, that looks like a G. 0.5 quarts, well what is that going to be? Well 8 minus 5 is 3, minus 0.5 is 2.5. So she is going to be left with 2.5 quarts. And we have answered the question in terms of the units they care about, in terms of quarts.
