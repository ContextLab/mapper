So we're told that the area of the entire figure below is one square unit, so that's the square right over here. And then we see the square is shaded in very interesting ways. It looks like we have this purple column shaded in, and then we have these three blue rows shaded in, and then this little pattern here looks like the overlap of those two. And what I will tell you is that this is an area model that's representing the multiplication of two fractions. And what I want you to figure out, pause this video, and see if you can figure out what two fractions we are multiplying, and then you can even think about what is the product of those two fractions based on the area model. Okay, now let's think about this together. So first, let's just think about what this purple column that is shaded in, what this represents, right over here, relative to the whole. Well, we could see that there's one, two, three, four, five of these equal columns. They're each a fifth of the whole. So that's a fifth, that's a fifth, that's a fifth, and then that's a fifth, and then that's a fifth. I'm talking about the entire columns here, not just each of those rectangles. And so our first one represents a fifth. Now let's think about the rows here. So each of these rows, we can see that we have four equal rows. So that's one, we have two, we have three, and then we have four equal rows. So each of these are a fourth, but if we think about the entire blue region that's shaded in, it's three of those rows. So it is three fourths. And the overlap between the two, this right over here, let me do that in another color, the overlap, this right over here, this is essentially where you're multiplying this three fourths times this one fifth. And so what we could say is this overlap is three fourths times one fifth. We could also write it as one fifth times three fourths. And if we wanna think about what that is, we just have to say, look, the whole is now split into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 equal rectangles. And you could have also said, hey, there's just four rows of five here, four times five is 20. So each of these are 20th and we have one, two, three of those 20th filled in. So this is going to be equal to three 20th.
