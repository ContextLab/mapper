Let's do an example on the performing translations exercise. Use the translate tool to find the image of triangle W-I-N for a translation of six units, positive six units, in the X direction, and negative three units in the Y direction. Alright, so we want to go positive six units in the X direction, and negative three units in the Y direction. Alright, so I click on the translate tool, click on the translate tool, and I want to go, so I want to go positive six units in the X direction. So I could pick any point and go six to the right, and everything else is going to come with it. So one, two, three, four, five, six. So I did that part. I translated positive six units in the X direction, and negative three units in the Y direction. So everything needs to go down by three. One, two, three. And notice, I focused on point N, and this is its image now, or the image of point N. This whole triangle is the image of this entire triangle, the triangle W-I-N after the transformation. But you see that every point shifted six to the right, six to the right, and three down. This point over here, six to the right would take you, let's see, it's at one and a half right now. Its X coordinate is one and a half. Its new X coordinate is seven and a half. So its X coordinate increased by six, and its old Y coordinate, or the original Y coordinate, was six, and now in the image, the corresponding Y coordinate is three. So it has, we have shifted it down three. So we've seen that that's happened to every point here, and we're done.
