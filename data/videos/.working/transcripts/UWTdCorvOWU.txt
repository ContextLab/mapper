As we've mentioned in previous videos, Hinduism is a very diverse religion with many different practices and even different beliefs, but there is a core centered around scripture. And the most important of these texts are the Vedas. Now the word Veda literally means knowledge in Sanskrit. And they were written during the Vedic period. It was called the Vedic period because this was the time that we believed the Vedas were written. And we have a whole video on the actual Vedic period. Now there are four Vedas, Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda. The first of these is the Rig Veda. When I say first, it's because it's believed that it was written before the other Vedas, as early as 3,500 years ago. The other three are also pretty old, probably older than 3,000 years old. Now these four texts are a combination of rituals, of hymns, of mantras, of songs, and of philosophy. For example, Rig Veda, Rig, you can translate as meaning praise, so it's knowledge of ways to praise. Praise the eternal or praise God. Yajur Veda, you could view as these prose mantras, knowledge of these prose mantras as Yajur Veda. Sama Veda, this is knowledge of songs or hymns. Atharva Veda, you can view these as knowledge of things that you should do in your life. Now these four texts can be subclassified into the type of text that they actually are. So what you see here is the subclassification of the Vedas that's often referenced, that amongst these texts, some of the verses are mantras, hymns, prayers, those are referred to as samitas, you have the things that are more ritual ceremonies, these are arayanakas. Arayanakas are also things being referred to, things that you have learned or rituals to do in the forest. Maybe at the time of when the Vedas were written, these were things that people would go meditate and do in the forest. You have the upanishads, which means to sit close to or sit near, and if you look at the upanishads, it really is referring to sitting close or near a teacher. There's a lot of dialogue between student and teacher. The upanishads in particular really form the spiritual core of Hinduism, it really focuses around spiritual philosophy, and amongst these four Vedas, there are 108 upanishads, and 108 is considered a very auspicious number in Hinduism. Now you also have brahmanas, which are commentary. Now to be clear, there are verses in the Vedas that can be many of these, that can be arnakas and upanishads, so these things are not mutually exclusive. Now in the Hindu tradition, one of the unifying factors are the Vedas and the subclassifications or subcategorizations of the Vedas. These are often viewed as divine revelations. Even though the Vedas themselves, some of the authors, refer to themselves as authors, as people who are introspecting on these ideas and writing about them, it is believed by many Hindus that this is divine revelation, and the term for that is shruti, and shruti can also be translated as what is heard, you could argue what is heard directly from the divine. Now in comparison to shruti, you also have this notion of smriti. Smriti can be translated as what is remembered, and there's a significant number of smriti texts, some of them that are also held very closely and meet the threshold of divine scripture for many Hindus. Now the most famous of the smriti text are the famous Hindu epics. So this is an image from the Ramayana. The Ramayana tells the story of Rama, who is one of Vishnu's incarnations, going to save the princess Sita from Ravana. The Mahabharata is the story of really a family feud between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. You see here the Pandava princes, the five Pandava princes, who are all married to Draupadi. It's an interesting story in the Mahabharata, how they did end up being married to one princess. And the most significant part of the Mahabharata for modern day Hindus is the Bhagavad Gita. It is a subset of the Mahabharata, and the Mahabharata is quite long, it will take you a while to read it, but the Bhagavad Gita is quite short. And the Bhagavad Gita takes place really in the climax of the Mahabharata, when you have the battle of Kurukshetra, where the Pandavas are fighting their cousins, the Kauravas. And one of the Pandava brothers, Arjun, who's really considered the greatest warrior of the brothers, as he takes his chariot into battle, his charioteer ends up being Krishna, also an avatar of Vishnu. And the Bhagavad Gita is really about the conversation between Krishna and Arjun, and it's all about Krishna reassuring Arjun not only his role in the universe, but it also becomes a little bit of a layer of the spiritual philosophy discussed in the Upanishads. In modern day India, the Bhagavad Gita is probably the scripture that is most cited by modern Hindus. So if you really wanna understand the spiritual core of Hinduism, the best place to look are the Upanishads, and you also have the Bhagavad Gita, which even though it's part of the Mahabharata, which is considered smriti, it is revered and is often considered to be divinely revealed by Hindus. Now this isn't a comprehensive listing of all of the scripture that is important to Hindus. Obviously, you have the Vedas, which are very ancient. Even these epics, their events might have taken place 3,000 years ago or maybe more. Their composition was over 2,000 years ago. They were canonized during the Gupta Empire, but there's many other texts. You have things that are believed written during the Vedic period, the Vedanga, which relate to things like medicine and astronomy. You have commentaries on things like the Upanishads, things like the Brahma Sutra. You have the Puranas, which literally means the old things. And these are a whole collection of old stories, epics, et cetera. So Hinduism, as I mentioned, it is a very broad religion. It is a very diverse religion, and you even see that in the texts. I'll now leave you with a final excerpt from the Bhagavad Gita. And what's interesting about this, as I mentioned, is the parallels that it gives to what we see in the Upanishads and some of what we looked at on the first video on Brahman and Atman. The man who sees me in everything, and everything within me, will not be lost to me, nor will I ever be lost to him. So this is Krishna talking to Arjun. And Krishna saying me, you could say God, or the ultimate reality, he who is rooted in oneness realizes that I am in every being. Wherever he goes, he remains in me. When he sees all being is equal in suffering or in joy, because they are like himself, that man has grown perfect in yoga. And the term yoga in modern day often refers to the type of stretching and exercising and body postures that you might even have at your local gym. But it's really a more general term of how do you connect to that ultimate reality? And some of what you might learn in the yoga class is one mechanism, leveraging the body, but there's other techniques through meditation, other things, other forms of yoga, that are trying to get the individual to better recognize the illusion, the mind around them, and get connected to the oneness of the ultimate reality.
