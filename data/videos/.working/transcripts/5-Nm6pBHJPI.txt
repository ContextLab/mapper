Teachers are the single most important actor in students learning. Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the not-for-profit organization Khan Academy, and I just want to tell all you teachers out there that we have an exciting program for this summer. It's called Khan Academy Teacher Training, and we want to do everything that we can to ensure that you have the content, the software, the tools, and the training to best meet the needs of your student. And so Khan Academy Teacher Training is a learning program that'll take you about an hour that allow you to learn from other teachers who are successfully using Khan Academy and seeing gains in their classroom. You'll get guides on how to use it in your classroom, and we'll also encourage you to have a plan for how you might want to implement it. If you complete this roughly one hour, you'll get a certificate and a chance to come visit us so that we can learn more from each other. So I encourage you to participate this summer. I think together we can really make a big difference for learners everywhere.
