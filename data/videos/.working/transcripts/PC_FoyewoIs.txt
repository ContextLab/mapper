Melana's town is built on a grid similar to the coordinate plane. She is riding her bicycle from her home at point negative 3 comma 4 to the mall at point negative 3 comma negative 7. Each unit on the graph denotes one city block. Plot the two points and find the distance between Melana's home and the mall. They tell her she is riding her bicycle from her home at point negative 3 comma 4. Let's plot negative 3 comma 4. I'll use this point right over here. Negative 3 is our x coordinate. We're going to go 3 to the left of the origin. 1, 2, 3. That gets us to negative 3. Positive 4 is our y coordinate. We're going to go 4 above the origin. I see we're going to go 4 up. We're going to go 4 up. We went negative 3 to the left. That's negative 3, positive 4. Or you could say we went positive 4, negative 3. This tells us what we do in the horizontal direction. This tells us what we do in the vertical direction. Let's figure out where her home is. Let's figure out where the mall is. It's at the point negative 3 comma negative 7. Negative 3 along the horizontal direction. Then negative 7 along the vertical direction. We get to negative 3, negative 7 right over there. Now we need to figure out the distance between her home and the mall. We could actually count it out or we could just compute it. If we wanted to count it out, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 blocks. We could type that in. Another way to think about it is they have the exact same x coordinate. They're both at the x coordinate, negative 3. The only difference between these two is what is happening in the y coordinate. This is at a positive 4, this is at a negative 7. We're really trying to find the distance between 4 and negative 7. If I were to say 4 minus negative 7, we would get this distance right over here. We have 4 minus negative 7, which is the same thing as 4 plus 7, which is 11. Let's do a couple more. Carlos is hanging a poster in the area shown by the red rectangle. He is placing a nail in the center of the blue line. In the second graph, plot the point where he places the nail. He wants to place a nail in the center of the blue line. The center of the blue line is 6 units long. The center is right over here. That's 3 to the right, 3 to the left. He wants to put the nail at the point x equals 0, y is equal to 4. He wants to put it at x is equal to 0, y is equal to 4. That's this point right over here. Let's check our answer. Let's do one more. Town A and Town B are connected by a train that has a station at the point negative 1, 3. I see that. The train tracks are in blue. Fair enough. Which town is closer to the station along the train route? Town A or Town B. They're not just asking us what's the crow's flight, the distance. The distance that if you were to fly. They're saying the distance, which town is closer to the station along the train route? If you were to follow the train route, just like that. The A right over here, if you were going along the train route, you would have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the x direction. Then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 along the y direction. You would have to go a total of 11. If you're going from B, you're going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 along the x direction. Then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6 along the vertical direction. You're going to go a total 17. It's pretty obvious that A is closer along the tracks. You could also think about it in terms of coordinates. Because A is at the coordinate negative 7, 8. If you were to think about negative 7, 8, to get from negative 7 to negative 1 along the x coordinates, you're going to go 6. Then to go from 8 to 3, you're going to go 5 more. You could also not necessarily count it out. You can actually just think about the coordinates. Either way, you see that town A is closer.
