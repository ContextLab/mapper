So this could very well be an exciting video because we start with this idea of a Fourier series that we could take a periodic function and represent it as an infinite sum of weighted cosines and sines, and we use that idea to say, well, can we find formulas for those coefficients? And we were able to do that using the powers of calculus, and now we can actually apply it for this particular square wave. And I picked a square wave that has a period of two pi, and that's where actually a lot of these two pi's came out from, and that's also why we started here at cosine t and sine of t. They both have a frequency of one over two pi, which is the frequency of our original square wave, and then the other terms have frequencies that are multiples of that. If we had a different period, then all of that would change, but I picked this period to just make the math a little bit simpler, and we will generalize in the future. But now, let's actually evaluate a sub zero, a sub n, and b sub n for this particular square wave. So the key to realize is that our square wave between zero and pi, because we're gonna keep taking the definite integral from zero to two pi, from zero to two pi, from zero to two pi, the key realization here is from zero to pi, our function is equal to three, and from pi to two pi, our function is equal to zero. So all of these definite integrals, so this definite integral, for example, is going to be the same thing as, and I'll do it once, and then we'll see that trend. This is the same thing as one over two pi times the definite integral from zero to pi of f of t dt, plus the integral from pi to two pi of f of t dt. Now, f of t between zero and pi, we just said it's equal to three, and f of t between pi and two pi, well, it's going to be equal to zero. And that's actually the case for these other situations, that f of t is gonna be zero from pi to two pi, and zero times anything is gonna be zero, so the integrals, the definite integrals over this, the second part of the interval, are always going to be zero. And so it boils down to this, and so what's the definite integral from zero to pi of three dt? Well, this is going to be equal to one over two pi times, times, so if you evaluate this, the antiderivative of three would be three t evaluated from zero to pi, and so it'd be three pi minus three times zero, which is just three pi. So it's equal to three pi over the two pi that we had already, over the two pi, and so this is going to be equal to three halves. Three halves, and that makes a lot of sense, because a sub zero, we said you could view that as the average value of the function over that interval, and the average value of that function is indeed, if it's three half the time and zero the other half of the time, well, then the average is going to be one and a half, or three halves, so that is our a sub zero. So now let's figure out the general a sub n, where n is not equal zero. So a sub n, well, we are just going to take, it's going to be one over pi, one over pi, the definite integral, I could go from zero to two pi, but instead I'm just going to cut to the chase. I'm going to go just from zero to pi, because the integral from pi to two pi is just going to be zero, because the function's equal to zero, it's going to be zero times cosine t, it's just going to be zero. So for this particular square wave, I can just worry about from zero to pi. From zero to pi, f of t is three, so it's going to be three cosine nt. Three, let me do that color, three cosine of nt, cosine nt dt. Now, what is this going to be equal to? Well, we can do a few things. We could take our three and bring it out front, so let me do that. So we could take that three and bring it out front, so just putting the three out here. So take that three, put it out front, and we know that the derivative of sine of nt is n cosine of nt, so let's multiply the inside by n, and then we could also divide by n, but we could put that outside. They would be n divided by n, we haven't changed the value. And so this is going to be equal to three over n pi, that's just what we had out here, times, well, the antiderivative of this business is going to be sine of nt, sine of nt, and we're gonna evaluate from zero to pi. So this is going to be equal to three over n pi times sine of n pi, well, that's gonna be zero for any n, minus sine of zero times n, well, that's gonna be zero for any n, so all of this is just going to be zero. So a sub n is going to be equal to zero. The coefficient of a sub n's for any n not equal zero, it's going to be zero, so actually we're not gonna have any of these cosines show up in the Fourier expansion. Well, let's think about our b sub n. When you look at the shape of the square wave, it actually makes a lot of sense, but let's now tackle our b sub n's. So our b sub n's, get a little space here, so b sub n, same thing. We could just worry about the interval from zero to pi, because from pi to two pi, our f of t is going to be equal to zero. So this is going to be equal to one over pi times the definite integral. Once again, I'm only gonna worry about from zero to pi, zero to pi dt. Now the value of the function from zero to pi is three, we've seen that before, I could put it here, but just to get a little bit simpler, let's just stick it right over here. So it's gonna be three, actually I don't wanna skip too many steps, it's gonna be three times sine of nt, three sine of nt, and let's see, how can I reconstruct this so it's easy to take the antiderivative? Well, this is going to be, if we take that three out front, it's gonna be three over pi, and then you have your definite integral from zero to pi of sine of, let me do that same color, sine of nt, sine of nt dt, and we know the derivative of cosine nt is negative n sine of nt, so let's throw a negative n in here, so negative n, but let's also divide by a negative n, just like that, if you have negative n divided by negative n, we haven't changed the value, that's just one, and so this is going to be equal to negative three over n pi times, we're going to take the antiderivative here, so this is gonna be cosine of nt, evaluated from zero, zero to pi, and so what is this, this is going to be equal to, this is equal to negative three over n pi, cosine of zero n, that's gonna be one for any n, minus cosine of, oh sorry, why did I start at zero, it's gonna be cosine of n pi, cosine of n pi, minus cosine of n times zero, so minus cosine of zero, cosine of zero is just gonna be one for any n, and so there you have it, we have a general, and you might say, well, cosine of n pi, is that positive one or is that negative one? Well, it depends, if n is even, this is going to be positive one, if n is odd, this is going to be negative one, so it depends, and actually, let's just write that out, so b sub n, b sub n is equal to, let's write those two cases, so if n is, if n is even, and another one, if n is odd, so if n is even, you're gonna have negative three over n pi times, actually, let me just do it over here, so we have the space, so what would this thing evaluate to if n is even, so this n, if it's even, it would be like cosine of two pi, cosine of four pi, cosine of six pi, well, in that situation, this is going to evaluate to one, you're gonna have one minus one, which is zero, so the whole thing is gonna evaluate to zero, and if n is odd, cosine of pi, cosine of three pi, cosine of five pi, well, those are gonna evaluate to negative one, then it's gonna be negative one if n is odd, negative one minus one is negative two, and so this is all gonna be negative two, negative two times negative three over n pi is going to be six, six over n pi, so there you have it, we have been able to figure out our Fourier expansion, it is going to be our square wave, and we definitely deserve a drum roll, this is many videos in the making, f of t is going to be equal to a sub zero, we figured out in this video is equal to three halves, so it's gonna be three halves, let me write this, well, let me just write it all in yellow, so three halves, now, we don't have any a sub n's, we figured that out, all of the a sub n's are going to be zero, and then the only b sub n's we have is when n is odd, when n is odd, so we're gonna have b sub one, so that's gonna be six over one pi, six over one pi, sine of one times t, so it's sine of t, plus, now, we're not gonna have a b sub two, we're gonna have a b sub three, so six over three pi times sine of three t, and of course, this is the same thing as, this is the same thing as two over pi, times sine of three t, plus, now, we're not gonna have a b sub four, we're gonna have a b sub five, so that's going to be six over five pi, six, actually, I liked writing it, it's nicer to actually not simplify here, because you can see the pattern, so it's gonna be plus six over five pi times sine of five t, and we're just gonna go on and on and on, and there you have it, we have our Fourier expansion, in the next video, we're actually going to visualize this.
