As we do AC analysis and we do operations in the frequency domain, we need to bring along Kirchhoff's laws so that we can make sense of circuits. So in this video, I'm gonna basically show that Kirchhoff's voltage law works in the frequency domain. What I have here is a circuit that has some voltage source, an AC voltage source, let's put AC on it, like that. And it has three impedances connected. Inside each of these boxes is an R, an L, or a C. And we're not gonna show which because we're gonna carry these along just as general impedances. So in AC analysis, the voltages are all cosine waves. So V in equals some voltage amplitude times cos of omega T plus, we'll call it phi zero, some starting phase shift. So this is our input signal. Now let me label the voltages on everything else. We'll call this V one. And I'm gonna label it this way here. And this'll be V two. And I'll put it upside down like that, plus. And this'll be V three, minus plus V three. And oh, now that I have V one here, let's change the name of this to V zero just so I don't get I and one mixed up. So we'll change that to zero. So the input source is V zero, and that's that voltage. Now when we apply KVL to this, Kirchhoff's voltage law, what it says is if we start in a corner, if we start somewhere in the circuit, let's start right here, and go around the loop, it should add up to zero volts. That's KVL for normal DC circuits. And we're gonna see how that applies to AC circuits here. So in time domain, we say that V zero plus V one plus V two plus V three equals zero. So let's talk about how this is gonna turn out. Well, what do we know right now? Well, we know that V zero is a cosine wave at some phase angle. Now, what do we know about the other voltages in this? In AC analysis, what we're doing is we're looking for a forced response. So we've let the natural responses to die out. There's no switch in this circuit. And we just assume the circuit has been in this state forever. So the natural response has died out. And that means we're looking for the forced response. So what we know is we have three voltages. We have three voltages. We know that all these voltages are gonna resemble the input voltage. So they're all gonna be sinusoids. All the voltages here are gonna be AC sinusoids because the forcing function is a sinusoid. The other thing we know, they're gonna all have the same omega. The frequency of this voltage and this voltage and this voltage is gonna be identical to omega here. I'm gonna put a big bang here. That's really important. In an AC circuit, when you're driving it from A frequency, every other frequency in the system is the same frequency. This is a linear system and linear components. If we, all the analysis we've done, linear components don't create new frequencies. They're all omega. Now, some other things we know. There's gonna be phase shifts involved here. Remember when we do impedance, we are multiplying by J and rotating things by 90 degrees. So we're gonna have different, different phi for each one. And the other thing we're gonna have is we're gonna have different, the amplitudes of our sinusoids are gonna be different. The amplitude of V1 could be different than the amplitude of V2. So this is what an AC solution is going to look like. Let's move on a little further here. What I'm gonna do now is we're gonna take this input voltage plus these things that we know here and we're gonna see how Kirchhoff's voltage law works in the frequency domain when we work with these transformed Zs, these impedances. Okay, let's go ahead and do that. Okay, let's do a little more in the time domain. And we'll write out our KVL equation again. So the KVL equation was V naught cosine omega t plus V0 plus V1, that's the amplitude of V1, cosine omega t plus some different phase angle. We don't know what that is yet. Plus V2, the amplitude of V2, cosine omega t plus phi three, plus V3, the amplitude of V3, cosine omega t plus phi three, all equals zero. And omega, all these omegas are the same exact number, the same radian frequency. All the phis are different and all the V2s and V3s are different. Okay, now I'm gonna switch to complex exponential notation. We're just changing notation here. We could represent this number here as this is the real part of V naught, V0, E to the j times omega t plus phi zero. That's exactly the same as this. This cosine can be represented as the real part of a complex exponential with this frequency. And I can write out the rest of these. V1, E to the j omega t plus phi one plus the real part of V2, E to the j omega t plus phi two, parentheses, plus V3, oops, real part of V3, E to the j omega t plus phi three, V3 equals zero. All right, now one thing I can do next, we can start to factor this, we can start to take this apart a little bit. So I know that if I have the expression, if I have the expression E to the j omega t plus phi, just in general, I can change that, but just by exponent properties, to E to the j phi, oh, let's get the parentheses in there, like that, E to the j phi times E to the j omega t. So I'm gonna do this transformation on all four of these terms here. Let's keep going. So we're still working on this, let's go, the real part now, I'm gonna take apart omega t and phi zero here, and I get V naught, E to the j phi zero, E to the j omega t, plus real part, V1, E to the j phi one, E to the j omega t, plus real part, V2, E to the j phi two, times E to the j omega t, plus real part, V3, E to the j phi three, E to the j omega t, all equal zero. And here's a nice simplification, we take out this common term, we're gonna factor out this common term across the entire equation. And what do we come up with? We come up with, the result is the real part of V zero, E to the j phi zero, plus V1, E to the j phi one, plus V2, E to the j phi two, see the pattern? All that times E to the j omega t, E to the j omega t, and we close that and that equals zero. And we're getting close, we're getting close. All right, how do we make this equation zero? Does E to the j omega t ever become zero? Well, E to the j omega t, E to the j omega t is a rotating vector, it's never zero. So that's not gonna do it. So how do we get it? Well, that means that this other term here has to be equal to zero. So how am I gonna do that? I'm gonna make one more notational change. This kind of a number here is called a phasor. It's some amplitude times E to a complex one angle. And there's no time up here, there's no time. The time is only over here. This is the only place that time appears in the equation, and this is the only place that omega appears in the equation. And these are just phase angles, these are starting phase angles. So my notation for a phasor is gonna be, this is gonna be called, I'm gonna call it V zero, and I'm gonna put a line over it to indicate that it's a complex vector. And that equals V naught E to the j phi naught. So when you see the vector symbol and the ought, that's that right there. And we can right now finally, the real part of V naught plus V one, phasor plus V two, phasor plus V three phasor equals zero. So this is KVL in the frequency domain. And fortunately, it looks exactly like KVL that we remember from our DC analysis. The sum of the voltages going around the loop is equal to zero. And in this case, it's the sum of the phasors going around the loop is equal to zero.
