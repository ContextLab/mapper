Let's say that we had a function defined by the infinite series, so we're gonna go from n equals one to infinity, and each term is going to be x to the n plus one over four to the n times n to the fourth, and we could even expand this out when n is equal to one. This is going to be x squared over four times one to the fourth, so it's just going to be four. When x is equal to two, this is going to be x to the third power over four squared, four squared times two to the fourth power, and we know this, of course, is 16 times 16, which would be 256, but I'll just leave it like that for now, plus when x is three, this is going to be x to the fourth over four to the fourth power times four to the fourth, times four to the fourth, so it's really going to be four to the eighth power, and we'll just keep going on and on and on, just to get a sense of what this function would look like, this function that's defined by an infinite series. Now, what I'm curious about is for what x values will this function converge to finite values? Or another way of thinking about it, is to come up with the radius of convergence or the interval of convergence for this function. Now, since we've just been talking about the ratio test, you might say, well, maybe the ratio test is useful. For what x values is this thing going to converge? So let's apply the ratio test. So let's take the limit, the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value, the absolute value of the n plus one-th term over the n-th term. And so for this particular case, this is going to be the limit as n approaches infinity. So the n plus one-th term, I'll do this in orange, so it'll be x to the n plus one plus one. So it's going to be x to the n plus two, so it's going to be x to the n plus two over four to the n plus one, four to the n plus one times n plus one to the fourth power, and we're going to divide that by the n-th term, which is just going to be x to the n plus one over four to the n times n to the fourth, which of course is going to be the same thing as the limit as n approaches infinity of, I can just copy and paste this, of this. So copy and paste that times the reciprocal of this. We're dividing by a rational expression. That's the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. So times four to the n, n to the fourth over x to the n plus one power. Actually, let me just clean this up a little bit. Now, can we simplify this? Well, x to the, let me get another color here. So x to the n plus two divided by x to the n plus one, well, n plus two minus n plus one is just going to be one. So this is just going to simplify to an x in the numerator. And then, let's see, four to the n divided by four to the n plus one. So this is the same thing as, this is the same, if we divide the numerator and denominator by four to the n, this is going to be a one, and this is just going to be a four. So this is going to simplify to, and I forgot my absolute value signs, don't want to do that. So let's keep my absolute value signs here the whole time. This is going to be equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of, we're going to have x n to the fourth in the numerator. So let me write that down. We're going to have x times n to the fourth in the numerator. And in the denominator, I'm going to have four times n plus one to the fourth. Well, what's that going to be? Well, if you expand out n plus one to the fourth, it's going to be n to the fourth plus a bunch of lower degree terms. This is going to be the highest degree terms. So if you distribute the fourth, it's going to be four n to the fourth plus a bunch of lower degree terms. So let me write it that way. So it's over four, I'll use the same colors, four n to the fourth plus a bunch of lower degree terms. of lower degree terms. Now, what's the limit as n approaches infinity here? Well, we have the same, we want to look at the highest degree terms. We want to look at the n to the fourth degree terms. And so it's really going to be the coefficient on this. And one way to think about it, if you divide the numerator and the denominator both by n to the fourth, these are the only terms, you're going to have an x in the numerator, and the denominator is going to have a four, and all these other terms are going to be divided by some power of n. So as your limit approaches, as n approaches infinity, all the other terms are going to go to zero, and all you're going to have left in the denominators are four and an x in the numerator. So this right over here, the limit as n approaches infinity is going to be x over four. Or I should say the absolute value of x over four. So it's going to be equal to the absolute value of x over the absolute value of x over four. And now we can apply the ratio test, or I guess we were always applying it, but now we can really test, do the test part of it. And the ratio test tells us that if this limit right over here, as long as it evaluates to something that is less than one, then our series will converge. And so we just have to say that this expression right over here has to be less than one. So our function is going to converge to finite values as long as the absolute value of x over four is less than one. And this is dividing the absolute value of, or the absolute value of x over four is going to be the same thing as the absolute value of x divided by four since four is positive, so that just has to be less than one. Multiply both sides by four, won't change the inequality since four is positive. So you're going to have the absolute value of x has to be less than four. And so just like that, we have defined the radius of convergence. This right over here is the radius of convergence for our function, or for our infinite series. Radius of convergence. Or if we wanted to write that same information as an interval of convergence, we would say that x, x has to be less than four or greater than negative four. This is the same information right over here. Expressed this way, this is the interval. Interval of convergence. Interval of convergence. So these are the x values for which this original function is going to converge to finite values.
