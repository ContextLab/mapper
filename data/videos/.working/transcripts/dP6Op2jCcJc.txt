Welcome to the Khan Academy channel on YouTube. I just wanted to give you a quick overview of everything we have. All of our videos are on YouTube, but I just wanted to show you this. Because if you go to our actual website, which is KhanAcademy.org, I don't know if you can see it. I have it right there, Khan Academy. And make sure you get the H before the A, KhanAcademy.org. All of the videos are a little bit better organized. I just wanted to introduce you to that. So we have over 600 videos. We have everything. And we have most of what is covered in first year calculus, pre-calculus, trigonometry, algebra 1 and 2, finance, pre-algebra. You could go to the site yourself and figure it out. We even have differential equations. I've started on linear algebra. And I've actually done 400 problems on SAT prep. I've done every math problem in this book. So just go to KhanAcademy.org. And then you can see all 600 videos. Actually, we're pushing 650 now because I've started doing GMAT videos. And you can just click on the category. So if you want to see trigonometry, it scrolls you up to trigonometry there. And then if you want to see a video on one of these topics, you just click on it. And it takes you to that YouTube video. And you can learn your trigonometry. And one thing I just want to, this is probably the best place where you can actually get the big picture of all the content we have. And I'll try to keep it updated fairly regularly. But if you do want to stay up to date on the actual videos that I'm creating, and I'm actually trying to get some other people to create with me. We might have some medical videos here before we know it. Subscribe to the Khan Academy channel on the page that you're probably looking at right now. So anyway, have fun with everything that we've made. And let me know if you want me to do a video on something else, or just let me know what you find useful or what you don't. Enjoy the videos.
