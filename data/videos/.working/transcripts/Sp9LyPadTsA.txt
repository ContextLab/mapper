- [David] Wordsmiths, hello. I'm on an archeological dig with my pal, Harrison Stockbury Smythe-Smythe. How are you, Harry? - [Harry] I'm spiffing, David, old thing. One never knows what marvels
one might find at a dig site, does one? - [David] There's one. - [Harry] What? - [David] Poking out of the ground. Look, use your little brush thingy. - [Harry] My word. - [David] Well, our words, right? They belong to everyone. - [Harry] Current, thus, despite. What a curious collection. - [David] I can take over
from here if you want, Harry. - [Harry] Smashing. Carry on, my good man. I'll keep digging here. Let a fellow know if you need him. - [David] Will do. All right, wordsmiths. Let's get to it. Current, thus, despite: meanings,
origins, use in sentences. Let's go. So, current is both an
adjective and a noun. I'll do the adjective first. It means up to date,
relating to the present time. As an adverb, currently, it
means in an up-to-date way. But as a noun, it means the
flow of a river or an ocean, or the flow of electricity. Thus is an adverb which means
as a result, for that reason. And despite is a preposition. We haven't talked about
one of those in a minute. It means even though or in spite of. Now, let's dust off these
finds in the word origin zone. Follow me. Current comes from the French
word corant, meaning running. From the Latin root
curse, which means to run. Current things move. So, a river runs along its course. Another related word. When I was a kid, I learned to hand write in
both print and in cursive, where the letters run together. It was part of the curriculum, which is another word for coursework. And both curriculum and
coursework share the same route. Thus is one of a handful of words that is actually native to English, it comes from old English. It's similar to the word this, which is also native to English. Words like these are
actual archeological finds because the core English
vocabulary is super small. English used to be a lot
more like German or Dutch. But about a thousand years ago, the French invaded England
and introduced a ton of French and Greek and Latin into our vocabulary. Think of it like a candy bar. Chocolatey outer coating of French, little caramel center of old English. Two great tastes that
taste great together. And despite, we've got D meaning down, and spite comes from
specere, meaning to look at, so spec, to look. It comes from this origin
of to look down upon someone or something. Despite as a preposition
doesn't have this meaning today, but a closely related word
does, and that's despise, which is to hate someone or something. Despite also contains the word spite, which is a feeling of hatred
or contempt, like, ugh. So, when you manage to
accomplish something, despite all the forces against you, you're saying, so there, I did it anyway. Let's use these words in some sentences. "He's not in the cupboard
and he's not under the bed, said Marya. But a set of paw prints
leads to the basement, and thus that must be where
Pebbles has hidden himself." Right, because of where the paw prints go, as a result of that, Pebbles the cat must be in the basement. "I can't talk right now. I'm currently very,
very busy with projects that cannot be interrupted." Using the adverbial form here, you see. Currently, at the moment. Right now, I'm very busy
playing my favorite farm sim. "Despite numerous interruptions, I still managed to beat the game on very extremely hard mode." Nevertheless, regardless, in spite of all the
impossible odds thrown my way, like having to do a job, I beat the game on very
extremely hard mode. - [Harry] David, we found another one. - [David] On my way. Alright, wordsmiths, it looks
like Harry made another find, so I gotta go help him out. But until next time,
you can learn anything. David out.
