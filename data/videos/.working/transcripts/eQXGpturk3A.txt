If you were to take a glass beaker, so let me draw it right over here, if you were to take a glass beaker and you were to fill it up with water, you might expect that the surface of the water would be flat. But it's actually not the case. And I encourage you to try it, and you might have even observed this before. The surface of the water will not be flat. The surface of the water will actually be higher near the glass than it is when it's away from the glass. It forms a shape that looks something like that. And so the first thing we might ask is, well, what do we call this thing? And this right over here is called a meniscus. Meniscus. And in particular, this meniscus, because the fluid is higher near the container than it is when you're away from the container, we would call this a concave meniscus. And you might say, well, if this is a concave meniscus, are there any situations where we might have a convex meniscus? Well, sure. You can have a convex meniscus. If you were to take that same glass beaker, instead of filling it with water, if you filled it with, say, mercury, if you filled it with mercury, you would get a meniscus that looks like this, where there's a bulge near the center when you're further away from the container than when you're at the container. And so let me actually just label this. This is a convex meniscus. But it's one thing to just observe this and to name them, to say, hey, this is a meniscus, this is a concave meniscus. But a more interesting question is, why does it actually happen? And so you might imagine this concave meniscus is because the fluid is more attracted to the container than it is to itself. And you might be saying, wait, wait, hold on. Hold on a second here. We've been talking about how water has this polarity, it has partial negative end. Each water molecule has a partially negative end, has partially positive ends at the hydrogens. Let me write this down. Partial positive charges at the hydrogens. And that causes this hydrogen bonding to form. And that's what kind of gives water all of these special properties. You're telling me that it's more attracted to the glass than it is to itself? And I would say, yes, I am telling you that. And you could imagine why it is going to be more attracted to the glass in itself. Because glass actually has, the molecules in glass, actually are quite polar. And glass, typically made up of silicon, a silicon oxide lattice. For every one silicon atom, you have two oxygen atoms. You see that right over there. For every one silicon, you have two oxygen atoms. And it turns out that the electronegativity difference between oxygen and silicon is even higher than the electronegativity difference between oxygen and hydrogen. Silicon is even less electronegative than hydrogen. So the oxygens are really able to hog silicon's electrons. Especially the ones that are involved in the bonding. So you have partial positive charges form at the silicon. And then you still have partial negative charges form around the oxygens. So these are partial negative and partial positive at the silicon. And so you can imagine what's going to happen at the interface. And let me make this clear what's going on. What I am circling right now, that is the water. This right over here, that's the water molecules. And what we see over here, these are the glass molecules. So this is the glass right over here. And sure, the water is attracted to itself because of the hydrogen bonds. But it has some kinetic energy. Remember, these things are jostling around. They're bouncing around. We're in a liquid state. And so you can imagine all of a sudden, maybe this character, this water molecule right over here, maybe a moment ago, it was right over here, but it popped up here. It just got knocked by another molecule, had enough kinetic energy to jump up here. But once it came up, it came in contact with the glass surface right over here, the glass molecules. It's stuck to them. Because it's partially positive end at the hydrogen. Let me do that in that green color. The partially positive end at the hydrogens would be attracted to the partially negative ends of the oxygens in the glass. And so it'll stick to it. This is actually a stronger partial charge than what you would actually see in the water because there's a bigger electronegativity difference between the silicon and the oxygen in the glass than the oxygen and the hydrogen in the water. So these things just keep bumping around. Maybe there's another water molecule that just gets knocked in the right way. All of a sudden, for a very brief moment, it gets knocked up here. And then it's going to stick to the glass. And this phenomenon of something sticking to its container, we would call that adhesion. So what you see going on here, that is called adhesion. And adhesion is the reason why you also see the water a little bit higher there. And when you talk about something sticking to itself, we call that cohesion. And that's what the hydrogen bonds are doing inside the water. So this right over here, that over there, that is cohesion. So that's why we have things, why we observe a meniscus like this. But there's even more fascinating properties of adhesion. If I were to take a container of water, and just to be clear what's going on here at the mercury, the mercury is more attracted to itself than it is to the glass container, so it bulges right over there. But let's go back to water. So let's say this is a big tub of water. I fill it. So I fill the water right over here. Now let's say I take a glass tube. And the material matters. It has to be a polar material. That's why you'll see the meniscus in glass. But you might not see it, or you won't see it, if you're dealing with a plastic tube, because the plastic does not have that polarity. But let's say you were to take a glass tube, a thin glass tube this time. So much thinner than even a beaker. So you take a thin glass tube, and you stick it in the water, you will observe something very cool. And I encourage you to do this. If you can get your hands on a thin glass tube, you will notice that the water is actually going to defy gravity and start climbing up this thin glass tube. And so that's interesting. Why is that happening? Well, this phenomenon, which we call capillary action. The word capillary, it'll refer to anything from a very, very narrow tube. And we also have capillaries in our circulation system. Capillaries are our thinnest blood vessels, they're very, very, very, very thin. And there's actually capillary action inside of our capillaries. But what we're seeing here, this is called capillary action. And it's really just this adhesion occurring more intensely, because more of the water molecules are able to come in touch with the polar glass lattice. And so you can imagine, we have glass here. If you also had glass over here, and actually it would be very hard to find something that's that thin that's on the order of only a few molecules. I'm not drawing things at scale. You can imagine now, OK, maybe another water molecule could jump up here and stick to the glass there. And then one just gets bumped the right way, jumps up, and jumps there. And if we didn't have a polar container, if we didn't have a hydrophilic container, well then the thing might just jump back down. But because it went up there, it kind of just stuck to it. And then it's vibrating there, and then maybe another water molecule gets attracted to it because of its hydrogen bonds. And then it gets bumped the right way. And then it gets bumped with a higher part of the container. But then it sticks there. So it starts climbing the container. And that's what capillary action is. And it's not just some neat parlor trick. We actually probably use capillary action in our everyday lives all the time, beyond the fact that it's actually happening in your capillaries in your body that allows you to live. But if you spill something on your counter, so let's say that's a spill right over there. You spill some water, or you spill some milk. And if you take a paper towel, in fact, if you take a paper towel like this, if you held it vertically, you will see the water start to be absorbed into the paper towel. This kind of absorption action that you see, that actually is capillary action. It's the water going into the small little gaps of the paper towel, but that's because it is attracted to the actual paper towel.
