So we have with us Sean O'Sullivan and first I'll give you a little background on the Khan Academy connection. It's about three years ago we get an email from you saying that you wanted to help us and we're like okay and so you show up and then you you know we spend a mortgage at 277 Castro. I think we were probably what a five-person organization then? Maybe three-person organization at the time. You spend a half an hour with a half a day with me and Shatnu and you leave essentially one of our biggest supporters ever. So you know thank you and that was a big boat of confidence in what we've done and it was that you know it was a phase of the organization where you know we didn't know what it would become and all the rest so that was a you know. Well I mean you were already so far down the road it was obvious that you were on to great things and here look at the team you've got around you. You've built an amazing set of products and capabilities and affecting many millions of people's lives. It's something that anyone is lucky whether you're working here or supporting Khan you know you're lucky to be a part of such a great social movement for good. Yeah no I knock on wood every morning. So let me introduce everyone to you. So you have you know there are actually several claims to fame that I knew about you before but then this morning I started doing some research about you and you have lived a full life. So I guess right now you're most famous especially in Ireland for being on the on the Dragon's Den which is essentially like the the Shark Tank of Ireland. Yep that's right. It's actually the third most popular show in Ireland after like the late late show and the news. So it's super like nobody really knows the Shark Tank here but you know it's I don't know it's probably the 50th or 100th most popular show in America I don't know but in Ireland you know I can't walk down the street without people you know. Giving you a bit or giving you a business plan and you have to be. It's one of these premises where it's a bunch of investors and they have to pitch and you'll all have like money on your coffee table. Yes that's the one. That's the show. And we have some footage of it. Who is prepared to enter the Dragon's Den? Inside could be the money to turn business dreams into reality but only the bravest and the best can tame the dragons who guard the prize. Those dragons are five of the country's most wealthy and successful business people and the budding entrepreneurs who dare to face them in the den need to convince them to invest in their dreams. The dragons all know what it takes to be successful in the fiercely competitive world of business having built their companies the hard way. Technology pioneer Sean O'Sullivan runs a vego a world-leading transportation software company headquartered in Cork and operating globally while investing millions in startup businesses. My vision is to make style and fashion with wonderful music engineering and this is it. It's called IGG guitars. The electric guitar industry has been dominated by products which have not been innovative for 50 years. I'm conscious of style. I like to wear clothes that represent what I stand for and so do all my generation. This is what they want. It's new, it's cool, it's highly functional and they will love it. I am doing for guitars what Steve Jobs has done for phones. You know one of my fellow dragons was in a rock band, Rockstar with an owned recording studios as well. It was only the piano player. Janet speaks French. If you Google it was big in the 50s. Okay, before I was born. Yeah, but not before Gavin was born. What's the market for guitars? How many sell a year? Yeah so like this is approximately between the States and Europe you've got about a million electric guitars per year. What is the revenues that you're projecting? I'm aiming to sell 2,000 guitars in the first year at 160 euros per guitar so that's working out at 320,000. I wanted to retail at 349 but I want to bring that back to 299 after you know I'm getting more efficient with production and stuff like that. Okay. Rob I think you're potentially a really great entrepreneur and I think you're probably gonna need more money to to do this than the 35,000. So I'd like to give you a little more money than you ask for and take a little more equity than you ask for. So I'd propose to give you 50,000 euro for 25% equity in your company. Also we have a hardware accelerator program in China that takes designers like yourself from anywhere around the world puts them in situ in the environment. We can put you into a program like that and get you working directly with the factories and getting more electronics. These are all things that I'd love to work with you on future generations of products. You know if I was working with you I'd really like to work with you but 25% would you do anything where you compare that back you know if we hit targets to 20%? If you sell 2,000 guitars in the first year I'll give up from 25 and down to 20%. Okay yeah. Yeah don't do. Great. Congratulations. A deal and a last-minute reduction in equity. Now that's worth getting out of bed for. Take it easy. Take care. Good luck. Was it him you were looking at? Oh yeah. Because I didn't see the differentiation in the product really. The product is different. It's absolutely different. Sean that sales model that he's going to sell it to pay as much as you think you feel guitars worth. I think that'll work. Yes. Alright that's it. That's Rob O'Reilly. And that's your clothes. And Rob has actually since come out with some second generation of product. So it worked out well? Yeah it worked out. This is like a real thing. Because you see this on TV shows you don't think. Yeah no it's actually a lot of times half the time the deal doesn't go through even after it seems like it goes through. In my case probably they go through around 80-85% of the time but some of the other dragons or sharks don't actually you know they don't come to terms. And so this is actually a venture that you're you're still working on. Yeah. They're producing you know it's got some rave reviews. It's very unusual guitar. It has several unique features that you know has a MIDI output as well as the sound output. It has you know it's cut out in the center. It has a balanced beam. It's got pectrum. You know it's a nicely designed guitar. And we'll talk about it because as we'll see that is part of your your past. It's in the music industry. Yes. That's a well. Invest in what you know. Exactly. So we'll start at the beginning because I mean obviously it's an interesting life so far you've had. You were born in New York. Yeah. You're Irish descent. Yeah. New York City Irish descent. You eventually end up back in Ireland. But how did it start? I was reading about I mean you were one of nine children. Yes I was one of nine children. So I was born in New York City. I actually had a you know a deadbeat dad actually. So we that's my mother and my father got separated when I was three and we were raised in poverty in upstate New York on the welfare system. And so for for five or six years my mom was raising the nine kids who were all under the age of 10. I was three. Nine kids under the age of 10. Yeah. That's one point. But then we got older and after after you know six or seven years of that she was able to get a job. And you know we sort of worked our way out of worked our way out of poverty over the years. But that was the that was the start of it. You know it's New York State is not a great place to be growing up poor because the weather is actually quite severe compared to California. So you know it could be you know with wind chill or whatever minus 40 degrees. And so when we would go to sleep at night you know in the dead of winter we gather in one room with a wood stove with the wood that we cut down from trees ourselves and just try to you know all of us you know some sometimes a couple people in one bed just the six or seven people say in one room sleeping with a wood stove. Yeah it's probably different than how you grew up but maybe not. It wasn't that bad actually. And I mean and how did you know given that start which is you know it's a hard beginning. How did you get into I mean technology how did you get into computers which was your kind of your first passion or one of your first passions that music. Yeah so my first passion probably would have been computers. I somehow saw my older brother went to college and he this was back in the day when they still had punch cards and I saw some you know some print ads of work that he was doing computer science program himself. And so I said wow I really I really it was just fascinating it was really appealing to me. You know when you are grow up or you don't have that much control over your environment and to actually be able to control a computer is an incredibly powerful thing you know it does whatever you tell it to do you know and you know that's that's really remarkable. So it was a way of getting some control over the situation and being able to develop myself and support myself. And you even support even when you were in high school or yeah yeah actually at my first professional job programming was when I was 14 so I had learned some programming and there's for the in America for the poorest of the poor there's a program called the Civilian Employment Training Act I'm not sure if it's still around but they basically give you jobs that are supposed to prepare you for a long-time career so they gave me a job being a janitor in my high school and I I said well geez that's not the greatest career potential and I don't understand why it's a training act if I don't really need that much training to push a broom around or a vacuum cleaner or whatever in the first place but I found a a county agency that was you know a couple miles from my house and so I asked the person who ran that agency if I could just have a job basically changing data tapes or you know printing out things just just to get started in and then when he discovered I could program and I could program better than several of the other you know programmers there were older you know professionals that I ended up getting started that way. Wow wow I didn't even appreciate I mean this wasn't that long ago this was like the early 80s this is the yeah early 80s early 80s that they would recommend for a 14 year old to be the janitor it is yeah like it's better than nothing because you still get to you know it's a minimum wage job but you still get some you're working and you're contributing to your family's you know you know your family's situation so it's not a terrible program it although you know they're there obviously they could have aimed a little higher than janitor so I did work as a janitor and as a as a you know groundskeeper and things like that for maybe a year before I'd found a way to get myself out of it. And that I mean obviously you got that that job and you kept developing it and you you go to Rensselaer. Yeah so I yeah into Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute which is in Troy, New York the oldest English speaking engineering school in the world continuously running or whatever the claim to fame is the inventor of the television the inventor of the semiconductor process the first microprocessor and all these other you know the Brooklyn Bridge all those other sort of things and and as a I had been I grew up like an hour southwest of there so I was always hearing about you know how they were in the Mars Loewer Rover project and all this when I was growing up and I just said wow that just sounds like the kind of thing I want to do to really impactful you know amazing things so that's what got me into engineering and never looked back you know I think that engineers have a disproportionate power in the planet to affect the world for in massive ways so you know you know we were just talking about this a little earlier that a lot of the brightest students unfortunately choose to to major in areas which are basically service industries like one-to-one service industries like the brightest kids in high school sometimes end up choosing to become doctors or lawyers and those are things that are one-to-one service industries versus becoming an engineer where you have the you know capability to affect you know millions of billions of people's lives with products that you design and impacts that you have on the planet which I've also been lucky to have been able to have been part of teams and leading teams that have had those kinds of changes over the years and and that's you know your first experience coming out of college and especially growing up poor it yeah I mean I didn't you know I my background wasn't as dire as yours but it's not not that different as well but it you know one of the things when you come out of college is that fear of well do I be an entrepreneur and kind of risk it all or do I at least just go for the middle class you know pay the bills get a car you went you went entrepreneurial are you yeah from the beginning days like I mean that you know it's it's really easy to go like you know living like a from living like a college student where you don't have any money you don't you know don't have any possessions or whatever to like living like an entrepreneur which is same thing here you haven't changed anything you don't have any money you're you know you don't have any needs or things that would prevent you from from doing it so I was lucky enough I had worked my way through college you know you know for IBM and a couple of other smaller tech companies well during summers and whatnot so I was able to know that I also I also knew before I graduated college that I didn't really want to work for a large company because I saw like you know IBM's great company and everything but I saw some of the best engineers that I was working with in research triangle Park at one point North Carolina that they they they were working on this video phone project back in 1984 or something and and then IBM the company bought Rome our OHM which is a key systems phone provider for like a billion dollars and so this team of super dedicated engineers that have been working like eight years on this amazing product just got x off because of some big corporate decision that had been made 10 levels above them and they've worked their bones off to produce this unbelievable you know you know break break groundbreaking products and they never saw the light of day and I said you know I'd rather not have that happen to me I'd rather be working in a smaller environment where I can have a lot more control over my destiny and so that's why I chose to start a company that's why I think it's always great to work in it's smaller organizations that do have big big impact like like like you have here at Khan Academy and that first it was map info this was I mean you it was kind of a pioneering company you know now everything you know Google Maps and you have all these you know yeah so if you've ever has anyone ever done this is anyone I've typed an address into a computer and seen a street map can I see a show of hands if anyone's been that before so we invented that you know and that was a long long time ago because I'm like I'm approaching 50 like you know a bullet train to to that wall over there you know before you could say oompa loompa I'm gonna be 50 years old so I like it was a long long time ago it's 30 years ago that we we did this and and you know it was it was a big idea back then and and it pioneered and set the groundwork for all the technology that has since developed from it you know I have a total huge respect for what you know that Google's you know that that Street Street View thing and and whatnot they've really you know a lot of companies have done a lot with the technology but we we we pioneered it the first million or so people that used street mapping on computers were worth you know 99% of them were using map info became a couple hundred million dollar company became a public company it was licensed by a lot of the bigger companies to do it but more importantly you know the thousands of resellers and the thousands of local countries that were using our products digitized all the street maps using our product or or made it available to their customers using our product which sort of set the groundwork for all the mapping that that happens today you know so it's pretty cool and that was that so that was my first company I was there for seven years and I was the president and chairman of it for for them and then I then I left and you let you know it goes public and you leave and you know the classic Silicon Valley thing is oh you know I've had one exit let me go do my next one or let me become a partner at a VC firm or yeah you start a rock band yeah yeah that was that was it unconventional choice I think I've made I've made it several unconventional choices I was listening earlier this morning to love his pain oh my god so that's a that's from our first first EP five song EP some some you know copyright violators put it up onto the internet which you were happy about I was funny because I thought the name of the band was Janet speaks French Janet speaks French Janet speaks French you actually were got I mean you got on the radio yeah we were 40 in like you know 80 radio stations are top 40 yeah yeah and we were but you know 80 radio stations in the United States is like there's 2800 radio stations or whatever so it's like no none of you would have heard it if you were even alive back in 1994 whenever it was I was there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and I mean and that was going through your mind I obviously music was a love of yours you had you know you I guess were comfortable at this point financially actually I wasn't quite comfortable at that point because the company was in the registration process that I hadn't actually gone public at that point so oh so for a while I was just doing it and you know that was alright like I don't live like in a really extravagant way I don't need that much money because you know it always you know it's a good grounding to remember where you came from because you could be right back there at any time you know you never know what was in front of you but yeah so I've never needed that much to get by so being a struggling rock musician wasn't that big of an adjustment for me and you do that for how many years are you years actually two years and then I started a technology company internet company it was 1995 or something end of 1995 and so that was back when Netscape wasn't called Netscape it was called mosaic communications and probably none of you even heard of Netscape even guys we hire people older than 16. I forget who I'm talking to. An engineering crowd, how many of you are engineers out there? A handful, kind of, a little bit. Used to be. That's very good. So yeah so yeah so and we came up with this concept of you know network services over the internet and software for inside the internet which we then called cloud computing you know so we came up with that term I co-coined that term myself and George Vadoloro from compact computer. We should take pause there. Yeah. Coined cloud computing. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. And love is pain. And it's not my favorite song actually. Oh yeah. Yeah so you'd have to probably go to the second album before you hit my favorites. But there's look what's what's good on that album. It isn't love. That's probably my favorite on that. It isn't love. You were going through some hard times. Yeah absolutely. I was not talking to the ladies. Yeah. Anyway, our next company gathering we'll have a little bit of that. We could talk about that online. Yeah. And so you start the next company and and that was another... The next was what I was called Netcentric. Netcentric and that included like say 10 million in sales. It wasn't a huge thing and it got sold off basically in pieces to Cisco or somebody else. I can't even remember. Like I blocked that whole part of my... It wasn't a great success at all. I mean the investors like myself I invested in it didn't make their money back on it. So it's a lesson in life. And then it was in and maybe I'm skipping. I found this fascinating. I didn't know about this. I mean we've known each other for three years. I didn't know this whole chapter in your life. You then go to Iraq. No actually then I became a filmmaker. Then you became a... Oh yeah you went to film school. You became a filmmaker. Yeah. So I went to USC film school in LA which is awesome. And I was making films. I made a you know like a hundred films in five years. Sounds like me. I just kind of... Yeah but like... You're surprised better. Well like the little like three minute videos and you know music videos and you know lots of other things like that. But I was looking for a project and the Iraq war was about to start in 2010. 2003 yeah. Yeah so it was March 2003 when I finally I was started working on trying to get into Iraq. Get permission to get into Iraq in the end of 2002. Because you saw the war was coming. The drum beats were coming. There were all these protests all over you know New York LA. I went and filmed all that. And then I got myself in with a peace activist group called the Christian Peacemaking Team. Which just I was just going to be documenting their struggles. And they were allowed into Iraq under the Saddam regime. And so I went in there and I was in Iraq when you know when in Baghdad when what was it called? Chancunal. You know began. It was actually quite an amazing time to be there and to see it both pre and post. But as a filmmaker you know I also you know as you do is when you go into dictatarian regimes they they have followers called... Oh geez I'm forgetting everything. Minders yeah. But the minders yeah. Oh yeah that's what they're called. Minders thank you very much. So they have government like the industry of information or I'm forgetting what the name of the ministry of information was. But anyway the ministry of information would attach a minder to you to make sure you didn't take photos of anything you're not supposed to take photos of. Because they only want to. They'll take you to a place where you know maybe a bomb went wrong or they they claim a bomb went the wrong way. Or they'll take you to hospitals and show you pictures of women and children but they won't actually let you photograph anything else. So I was ejected from the country because I've never taken very well to to rule rules. And so that's where I met my wife actually. She was she was just also a rule breaker. She was she was arrested by the Syrians when she was trying to cross the river into Iraq you know illegally still not coming in. So but she was in Jordan and then when the wall or when Baghdad fell the border fell and we were able to go back into the country. And so it was there for the next 18 months or so. Wow. Now this is like you can make a movie. I'm already imagining the casting for. Yeah. Yeah. That's your movie. The cast is me. Yeah. Well I'll think about that. I have some ideas but I'll tell you. The and so then and then you go back into I mean this is that's and I was even reading. I mean one of your partners in this. Yeah. Moheim and Al Safar probably is that what you're saying. Yeah. So I started I worked a little bit for CNN and Reuters and just doing a lot of freelance work at that point. And then after a while I got fed up with the U.S. government's ability to execute. You know they were just really in a you know they couldn't get anything done. It didn't seem so. So I started a humanitarian organization called Time Start International. And we went in and we cleaned up a whole bunch of we employed 3500 people in the end. It started with just myself and 30 guys and then we grew it up over you know over the time to about 3500 people. So we were actually the largest humanitarian organization after the U.N. pulled out pretty early. You know they were they were bombed and whatnot. So in this is this is during the war. What time period is this. This is well actually there was a sort of a post war period which was from say around April May of 2003 to when the Civil War started which was April of 2004. I see. So I was I you were kicked out. You went back you and then you come back. I come. I came back almost immediately. Because Baghdad just lasted for another nine days or something like that before it fell or five days or something. And then and then I went back and then I was running this humanitarian organization and then the Civil War. And I built that up and the Civil War started in April of 2004. And then I was still there you know for until the end of that year. Wow. And your partner. Yeah. My co-founder of Jump Start was Mohim and Al Safar who was in Iraqi. And he was he was assassinated because we used to. We were we were just driving around all the time. You know just us visiting all the projects so we would have 80 projects at a time. You know hospitals and you know universities and we'd be cleaning up or taking down skyscrapers that were bombed or burned. And then just thought it was just a big manpower and engineering sort of effort to try to clean up the city and and re you know we built a lot of housing thousands of homes. And I mean you must have seen some. Yeah. So like John. Yeah. So. So both during the war and you know the Civil War is actually the worst part. If you think about American history the Civil War is where more Americans have ever died. I'm sure many factors. Half a million. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you'd have with the smalls whether it be 200 250 thousand or something like that would die versus you know in World War Two over six years or something. I think we lost a million people or less than that. You know. So so the civil American Civil War is the worst in the in Iraq. It's the exact same thing you know with when that started in April 2004 all the way till recently. You know it's it's been the bloodiest sort of. And you were inserting yourselves and kind of the I mean just where the yes carnage and where. Yeah. So like we would clean up after a terrorist bombing you know and there'd be body parts and we'd be stepping over body parts or stepping on them or cleaning you know cleaning up things. A lot of my workers would be injured. And I was just living in the I wasn't living in the green zone which is the American occupied or the coalition occupied territory. I was living in you know the red zone the other area the other parts of the city. So so we would just go around all the time. I mean I guess there's a question you know what was driving you to do. I was frustrated. You know I mean what what does any entrepreneur you know feel like you know when you see a market that's not being served when you when you when you just like this needs to happen. You know like it's so stupid that it the work wasn't getting done. But you didn't think I mean especially as a you know American or someone who looks you know especially as American. But you know not being in the green zone where you see I mean you could be a target. Yeah. Yeah. Ducted. You could be sure. So sure. But you know but there were Americans there risking their lives. They had suits and you know guns and whatnot. You know but why shouldn't an American who's unarmed you know be out there risking their life. You know for the same for the same cause you know to hopefully liberate the country and set them on their their course and leave them alone. But you know it's it's you know I was in danger. Were there a lot of folks like this. I mean there weren't many. Yeah. Because I mean my impression just through the news and whatever else is that you had the green zone. That's where the civilian. The Western civilians lived. And every now and then they might with a huge military escort kind of making excursion outside of the green zone. So I mean were there. And there's actually USA Today calling me at one point. I think it was around September 2004 and they said we think you're the last. We think you're the last one there. You know the Christian peace making team I kept in contact with. They're still around. And then then they got you know they got kidnapped and tortured and some of them killed as well. So like there were not that many people and most of them were. I mean I'm just trying to like I mean it's admirable and it's amazing to kind of go in and do this stuff. And but especially you know you're like the last one even the people who are turn off the lights when you were right. They're getting abducted getting tortured. Yeah. No I had probably most of most of the people I knew probably got either kidnapped or. But I mean in your mind did you view this as a rational. Weren't you afraid weren't you. You know there's being brave and then there's. Yeah. Well actually what finally sent me from the country. And when I did leave is because they thought that actually and I'm not that I'm not that you know I'm not that religious of a person. But what finally sent me from the country is I was blinded in my left eye and I had cancer. And that that was two indicators. If it was just the cancer bites. Well I got I got skin cancer actually. And if you look closely they actually cut out an inch and two inch patch. And it just kept getting worse and I couldn't you know. And I. And actually the US. I was your family telling you what it was very good. They didn't even charge me anything. Well they should have. No. And then and then. And then I went blind in my left eye. And that was because I got some infection and then the Iraqi doctor that I went to gave me a steroid. But it was a viral infection. And so a steroid on a virus makes it a super virus. And it basically ate my eye. And so it ate the skin off my eye. And I didn't have a skin on my eye. And it was bad. And at that point I said you know God is trying to give me a message. Because in Irish actually O'Sullivan O'Souwan means the one eye giant or something. So so so there I was with one eye left. And and actually amazingly you know I got I got treatment for it afterwards. And you know they they take your blood and they make some sort of special potion out of your blood. And it's it's you can put it into your eye. And my eye grew back and my vision got better than it was before. So so so actually my vision is now better. Better was free being eaten by a steroid induced virus. Eye eating virus. If you have trouble I recommend going to Iraq. I sent you up with this Iraqi doctor. Yeah. I didn't. I didn't even I mean I didn't even know half of this stuff. I thought I'd done my back. This is mind blowing. Yeah. I want to talk more. At the end of it I said you know what I'm getting enough messages here. I mean everybody's telling me I mean frickin NBC News followed me around for a day to do my obituary. You know so like seriously. Yeah. I didn't. They didn't tell me like the guy who wants to have a guy. No no no no. I didn't want to die. I didn't want to die. It looks like someone who almost has a guy who over one who always you know like Americans had to do something. I know it's very very very frustrating to just go and do do do you know to let the situation be what it was. And I'm proud of America actually. You know I think Americans try to do the most incredible things for the planet. Their intent what separates their intent and their execution sometimes is awful. You know and you know and everyone says oh yeah there was some ill intent in all this and yeah maybe a little bit but it was mostly just misconceived in my view. And so like to just let that go you know that was it was speaking to my core that I needed to do something and I was in a place to do something. I had some money. I actually gave you know I started this started it myself and then I got some UN funding and some some other funding to keep it was your wife with you. She yeah she was well she's a more than she was you know she she's a she was a war reporter. So so she's a little bit accustomed to it but it was time for both of us to get out. So we we got married and then and I was actually then I was working in the Gaza Strip. We built a university you know Gaza Polytechnic and and I was on that trip. You know we got married on New Year's Eve and nine months and seven days later Charlotte our first daughter was born. And so I think that's God's other signal was that you know I was not supposed to be in war zones anymore. So I you know when I was in the Gaza Strip when I found out my wife was pregnant and that was basically at the end of it. I said screw it. I'm not going to do this anymore. So so I didn't. And now I've gone back and I found myself with the technology technology and then you go back to Ireland. Why Ireland as opposed to I was using my Irish passport when I was going in and around in the green zone and to get into the green zone and as opposed to why the Irish. Well I was under the pretense that that that Iraqi Arabic speakers couldn't tell the difference between Irish sounding accents and American sounding accents. And actually I know it would just be better if you were kind of abducted with an Irish passport as an American. Yeah absolutely. It would be better. The admission fee to get in for a visa is like one tenth as much if you have your Irish passport versus if you have your American passport. A hundred dollars or something to get in as an American or five dollars. And so then when you go back to Ireland you I guess because you were using the passport you started to feel I guess you always kept some type of a joint citizenship or. Yeah I had through my grandparents I had Irish citizenship. So anyway so I started a company in Ireland and now you know I live the quality of life in Ireland. It's great. You know I love it. It's great being there and we've just sort of started a company that I'm a couple of companies that I'm on my own. You start a couple companies and even in your current SOS ventures you all have backed some of them. Fairly well known. Yeah. So Tar Hero. Oh yeah. Well yeah. So yeah. Guitar Hero would have been a great win for us. This you know I backed you know pretty heavily a company called Netflix. Yeah we've heard of it. Yes. I've done. Yeah it's done well. And you know a number like we have about 160 companies in the portfolio. Leap Motion is one of the ones I was just talking about is a great big one that we were first VC in on that as well. That's a recent one. But there's you know. And so this week in San Francisco we're actually launching 20 different companies on Monday. We launched 10 from Accelerator and today later today we're launching the leap accelerator program in San Francisco with 10 new companies. So so so we do a lot. And I manage a couple hundred million dollar fund and we believe in accelerating companies. You know that we're the accelerator VC. So we do a lot to try to start as many good companies as we can because you know ultimately you can try to you can try to go in and you can try to you know change people's lives by you know building a house or something like that. But if you can change change their lives by for example enabling cloud computing or enabling you know street mapping our computers or any of these new technologies that were that were were launching you know these are really transforming tens of millions or if not more of people's lives. This is what I was speaking to you know in terms of the disproportionate power that engineers have to impact you know the quality of life of mankind. And we can you know that that's the most impact you can have as a person. So even as a venture capitalist you know that's what I look to you know is this adding good to the planet to do this. And what you're doing in Khan Academy you know it was a five million dollar commitment that we made which is a reasonable size commitment. Huge for I mean it's it's it's continues to be one of our largest gifts ever. But especially that face of the organization it was it was a big deal for us. Well thank you. But you know I feel honored that you know to be a part of a part of your success because what you're doing is so transformative and potentially so transformative. I know you're only part of the way there. So none of you engineers need to rest on your laurels because it's a lot more a lot more that needs to be done. But yeah. But you know life is like that. You know you try to get up every day and do something you know amazing. And you know try to make the world a better place. That's all that's all the guiding philosophy is about. And I mean what's been incredible obviously you help support us. But you've also turned into something of an adviser and you've been driving some pretty neat initiatives in Ireland that we're actually hoping to eventually. Yes. So I'm a little petri dish and we've got this thing going. I don't know if Sal or any of the gang has talked about it called mathletes. And it's an experiment that we try and it is super cool. It is just super cool. I was just looking over some of the stats this morning and you know we've launched. We came up with this idea. To try to duplicate the passion that people have about athletics and the pride that people have about their school or their individual performance. And try to have people be as dedicated to their schools through mathematics as they would to athletics. And this is something that you know it seems like it's working. You know it's early days. But in just the age range that we're talking about from 11 to 15. Evidently by running this mathletes competition over two and a half months the web traffic for Khan Academy is something like three and a half times. For all of Ireland. For all of Ireland. Essentially just getting started these last few months. Yeah. And so we launched the idea. You know one and a half percent of all the kids in Ireland in that age range are now competing in mathletes. If you did that across the United States I think it would be like 70 thousand 70 thousand schools. We'd be competing. And it's competing at a you know with at a very very very significant level like there. The top one percent of kids in the last two and a half months have spent. I don't know. We just looked at the stats. It was 20 something hundred twenty seven or something like that. So you know the study several months in just two months. Several grade levels of math. You know in just two and a half months. Now that's the top one percent. But if you take it to the top five percent or top 10 percent they've done several grade levels of math in and you know with the seven hundred minutes or five hundred and eighty minutes. That's really turned to a national thing. The prime ministers. Yeah. It was all the the on Tisha which is the Irish for prime minister. It's a ministerial form of government rather than the president in Ireland doesn't. Is this is not the same as the president here. So so the on Tisha is the head of the government. And so he's given away the mathletes prizes. We have little trophies that he gives that have been given to the schools for their competition. It started in February. The final the finals and it works out like you know like the NCAA sort of thing where there's a whole you know press coverage and there's leaderboards that go out every week. People know where their schools are on the leaderboards on the county level on a regional level and on a national level. And so there's a tremendous amount of pride that people are taking in their accomplishments and the accomplishments of their school. And the teachers are getting sucked into this because they're passionate about it and because they're because it's exciting and because the kids are excited. And so it's potentially a really really really interesting way of you know we've seen that you know something like three hundred fifty percent. You know the number of the number of people that are participating in Ireland is only doubled even though it's just this age age range. But the on Khan Academy now but the the the engagement is like four times. So so the the number of page views and the number of time. So if if we can duplicate that for the world you know or for the United States then you're talking about a lot of impact. And we're I'm super excited about this. And another thing I'm excited about is this men this fallacy that women aren't good at math. And this proves you know we've got exactly 50 50 you know gender split for the top performing math in the in the in the country. And then even at the national competition which is taking place next Saturday this there is a slight discrepancy but we don't know if there's gender bias in the in how parents. We don't know we have to look at the data a little bit more but it's still incredibly similar. It's 54 percent to 46 percent. Boys to girls at the at the national level which when you think about your day Sal when you were in math competitions how many women were in the competitions versus men. There weren't many. There were. Yes. It's like an engineering school one in 10 or one in one six or something. It's awful. So we need to know that as they say women hold up half the sky. So you know we have to we have to use all of our talent all of our people to to advance the planet and more women should become you know more more technically capable. Yeah. Awesome. Well thank you. I mean I could go on for hours because actually on each of this. I'm actually have a million questions about Iraq as well. But anyway I mean thank you so much. This was a bigger treat than I even expected. The more I got to even know you who I've known for three years. But the more your background my respect for you has gone to even a whole other level. And thank you for being an early supporter and continuing to do incredible things and pushing us into the direction frankly we should be going in which is getting more community building and more people to kind of really feel invested in and learning. Yeah we're all we're all learning here. And so you know each day is each day is a joy if we just take it that way. We don't know what's what the future is. We can't predict what the future is but we can we can measure we can go in a lean way and we can adapt our course on the way. And hopefully some of the learnings we're doing our little Petri dish in Ireland can apply to the overall mission which I love about what Khan Academy is doing. So great. Thank you. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you.
