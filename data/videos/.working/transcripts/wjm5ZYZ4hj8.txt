Let's say that y is equal to five minus three x over x squared plus three x. And we want to figure out what is the derivative of y with respect to x. Now, it might immediately jump out at you that look, look, y is being defined as a rational expression here, as the quotient of two different expressions. Or you could even view this as two different functions. You could view this one up here as u of x. So you could say this is the same thing. This is the same thing as u of x over, you could view the one in the denominator as v of x. So that one right there is v of x. And so if you're taking the derivative of something that can be expressed in this way as the quotient of two different functions, well, then you could use the quotient rule. And I'll give you my little aside, like I always do, the quotient rule, if you ever forget it, it can be derived from the product rule. And we have videos there, because the product rule's a little bit easier to remember. But what I can do is just say, look, dy dx, if y is just u of x over v of x, I'm just gonna restate the quotient rule. This is going to be, this is going to be the derivative of the function in the numerator. So d dx of u of x times the function in the denominator, times v of x, minus, minus, I'll do the, minus the function in the numerator, u of x times the derivative of the function in the denominator, times d dx, v of x, and we're almost there. And then over, over, the function in the denominator squared. The function in the denominator squared. So this might look messy, but all we have to do now is think about, well, what is the derivative of u of x? What is the derivative of v of x? And we should just be able to substitute those things back into this expression we just wrote down. So let's do that. So the derivative with respect to x of u of x, of u of x, is equal to, let's see, five minus three x, the derivative of five is zero. The derivative of negative three x, well, that's just gonna be negative three. That's just negative three. If any of that looks completely unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to review the derivative properties and maybe the power rule. And now let's think about what is the derivative with respect to x? Derivative with respect to x. Of v of x. Of v of x. Well, derivative of x squared, we just bring that exponent out front. It's gonna be two times x to the, two minus one, or two x to the first power, or just two x. And then the derivative of three x is just three. So two x plus three. And now we know everything we need to substitute back in here. The derivative of u with respect to x, this right over here is just negative three. V of x, this we know, is x squared plus three x. We know that this right over here is v of x. And then u of x, we know, is five minus three x. Five minus three x. The derivative of v with respect to x, we know, is two x plus three. Two x plus three. And then finally, v of x, we know is x squared plus three x. So this is x squared plus three x. And so what do we get? Well, we are going to get, and it's gonna look a little bit hairy, it's going to be equal to negative, I'll focus, so first we have, first we have this business up here. So it's negative three times x squared plus three x. So I'm just gonna distribute the negative three. So it's negative three x squared minus nine x. And then from that, we are going to subtract the product of these two expressions. And so let's see what that, what is that going to be? Well, we have a five times two x, which is 10 x, a five times three, which is 15. We have a negative three x times two x. So that is going to be negative six x squared, minus six x squared. And then a negative three x times three. So negative nine x. And let's see, we can simplify that a little bit. 10 x minus nine x, well that's just going to leave us with x. So if we, 10 x minus nine x is just going to be x. And then in our denominator, we're almost there, in our denominator we could just write that as x plus three x, x squared plus three x squared. Or if we want, we could expand it out, I'll just leave it like that. x squared plus three x squared. And so if we want to, let's just simplify, or attempt to simplify this a little bit. There's going to be negative three x squared minus nine x. And then, let's see, you're going to have a negative minus x, minus x, and then minus 15, and then minus negative six x squared. So plus six x squared. All of that, all of that over x squared plus three x squared. Or x squared plus three x squared. I should say it that way. Now let's see, this numerator I can simplify a little bit. Negative three x squared plus six x squared, that's going to be positive three x squared. And then we have, we have, I'll do it in orange, we have negative nine x minus an x, well that's going to be minus 10 x, minus 10 x, and then we have minus 15. So minus 15. And so there you have it. We finally have finished. This is all going to be equal to, this is all going to be equal to three x squared minus 10 x minus 15 over x squared plus three x squared, and we are done.
