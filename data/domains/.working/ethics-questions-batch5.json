    "correct_answer": "Moral sentences embedded in conditionals or disjunctions seem to retain their meaning, but expressivism cannot easily explain this since unasserted moral clauses express no attitude.",
    "distractors": [
      "Moral sentences embedded in universal generalizations seem to lose their normative force, and expressivism cannot explain why speakers still treat them as action-guiding prescriptions.",
      "Moral sentences combined with empirical premises appear to generate new factual claims, and expressivism cannot account for how attitudes produce truth-evaluable descriptive conclusions.",
      "Moral sentences nested inside propositional-attitude reports seem to acquire representational content, and expressivism cannot reconcile this with its denial of moral belief states."
