Just to realize that I typed in the wrong numbers at the end of the last video when I was trying to put them in the calculator, we were trying to determine the coefficient of static friction, and it's 50 Newtons divided by 49 square roots of 3 Newtons. And in the last video, by accident, in the calculator, instead of doing 49 square roots of 3, I wrote 40 square roots of 3. So let's actually calculate it again. 50 divided by 49 times the square root of 3 gives us a coefficient of static friction of, if we round it, 0.59. So this is equal to 0.59. And so that's it. I did the calculation wrong on the calculator in the last video.
