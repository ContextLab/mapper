Everyone here at the Khan Academy has been blown away by the responses to previous challenges, even some of the ones that are works in progress, because they really were difficult challenges. And so what we want to do is put more challenges out there so that there are different levels of difficulty, different ones will inspire people in different ways. And so in this video I want to announce another challenge, and this is a challenge to visualize a core concept in calculus, and that's the chain rule. And once again this video up here when you go to the challenge will describe it better. And to enter the challenge of how one could visualize the chain rule in calculus, you just save as a spin-off and you can vote for other people's, the ones that really capture your imagination. And I look forward to potentially using the interesting visualizations, the ones that really get to the heart of the matter in some interesting way, within the calculus playlist. So I will thank you ahead of time for helping us create content for users, and I will extend a thank you from the users themselves, because I think it'll really help many many people studying calculus if we could have some very interesting visualizations that give us a gut intuition of the chain rule.
