The whole is just its parts.\" \n- Ben: \"We explain Blinky's walking by studying each gear and how they push each other.\" \n- Cara: \"We rewrote old robot rules into physics words, derived motion equations, and showed why they work.\" \n\nAnother student, Dana, says: \"Blinky makes a light pattern you cannot see in any single part.\" \n\nWhich choice best matches Anna, Ben, and Cara with the three kinds of reductionism, and explains Dana's idea correctly?",
