Hi, I'm Kanmigo. Let's meet some great teachers, just like you. I teach chemistry. IELD students, the English language learners. 6th grade math. Computer science. I teach high school math. I'm a student teacher. Please tell us more. I have to lead three different types of classes and I have to come up with how I'm going to teach the curriculum and that's a really daunting process but having Kanmigo, it's a really helpful assistant to kind of put all those pieces together. We're doing gas dynamics and we're teaching it through the lens of climate change. How can I make that real for my students? And so I might ask Kanmigo, give me a hook for starting our unit on the chemistry of climate change and it'll give me four or five options. I like that I can ask Kanmigo a question or say, hey, I need like an easy, a medium and a hard. So it can help me develop my lesson plan into three different categories where instead of going to multiple websites or looking for different resources, I can do it all in one location. It really helps with differentiating the instruction for all the kids. Yeah, it saves me a lot of time. Not having to do the groupings, it does it for me. Kanmigo kind of takes care of the initial blank white page, gives me that starting point. From start to finish, just faster. Could save 20, 30 minutes a day times five. So I was kind of blown away by that. If I wasn't going to use Kanmigo, then I'd have to search for all these different activities or these exit tickets or questions to ask. And that would take hours of my time each week. My pleasure, but it's not about me. It wasn't that Kanmigo was replacing human interaction, it was augmenting it. It's not really about the AI, it's that the AI is going to enable more human to human interactions. You're able to go to those students that need the most amount of help and let the ones that are able to move on their own just excel. That's right. It's about you and your students. So come on, let's get started.
