As a hint, I will take the determinant of another three by three matrix, but it's the exact same process for the three by three matrix that you're trying to find the determinant of. So here is matrix A, here it's these digits, this is a three by three matrix, and now let's evaluate its determinant. So what we have to remember is a checkerboard pattern when we think of three by three matrices. Positive, negative, positive. So first we're gonna take positive, or a positive one times four, so we can just write plus four, times four, the determinant of four submatrix. And once you say, what's the submatrix? Well get rid of the column for that digit and the row, and then the submatrix is what's left over. So we're gonna take the determinant of its submatrix. So it's five, three, zero, zero. Then we move on to the second item in this row, in this top row, but the checkerboard pattern says we're gonna take the negative of it. So it's gonna be negative of negative one. Let me do that in a slightly different color. Of negative one, of negative one, times the determinant of its submatrix. So the determinant of its submatrix, you get rid of this row and this column, you're left with four, three, negative two, zero. Four, three, negative two, and zero. And then finally you have positive again. Positive times one, times one, this one right over here, let me put the positive in that same blue color. So positive one, or plus one, or positive one times one, times one, really the negative is where it got a little confusing on this middle term. But positive one times one, times the determinant of its submatrix. So its submatrix is this right over here. Get rid of the row, get rid of the column. Four, five, negative two, zero. Four, five, negative two, and zero. So now we just have to evaluate these two by two determinants. So the determinant right over here is going to be five times zero, minus three times zero. Minus three times zero, and all of that is going to be multiplied times four. Well this is going to be zero minus zero, so this is all just a zero, so four times zero is just a zero. So this all simplifies to zero. Now let's do this term. Negative negative one, so that's positive one. So let me just make these positive. Positive one, or we could just write plus, let me just write it here. So positive one, times four times zero is zero. So four times zero, minus three times negative two. Three times negative two is negative six. So you have zero minus negative six, which is positive six. Positive six times one is just six. So you have plus six, and then finally you have this last determinant. You have, so it's going to be plus one, times four times zero, four times zero, minus five times negative two. Five times negative two. So this is going to be equal to, it's just going to be equal to one times anything, it's just the same thing, four times zero is zero, and then five times negative two is negative 10, but we're going to subtract a negative 10, so you get positive 10. So this just simplifies to 10. Positive 10, so you're left with, let me be clear, this is zero, all of this simplifies to plus six, and all of this simplifies to plus 10, and so you are left with, if you add these up, six plus 10 is equal to 16. So the trick here is to just make sure you remember the checkerboard pattern, and you don't mess up with all of the negative numbers and all of the multiplying.
