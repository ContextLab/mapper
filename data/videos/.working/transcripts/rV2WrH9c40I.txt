Hi, I'm Rachel with Khan Academy. Are you ready to make a plan for boosting those SAT scores that's stuck about what to do next? Let's walk through two strategies that can help you make the most of your prep time and focus on your strengths. Strategy 1 is all about using the SAT prep courses in Khan Academy. So how do you obtain your scores? You can get your scores and performance spans from a PDF copy from your school counselor, the big future school mobile app if you provided your mobile number, or your self-created College Board student account. If you took a practice test in Bluebook, you can get your scores from the College Board My Practice webpage too. How do you understand your scores? The report will look a little different depending on if you are looking at the PDF or an online report. There are four content domains for each section of the test. For example, algebra is one content domain assessed in the math section. The number of questions and percentage of each domain will be different depending on if you took one of the PSAT related assessments or the SAT. You'll notice that the scores reflect the same structure as the digital SAT prep courses in Khan Academy. Check your performance bands to know where to place your focus. If you have one to three bands shaded, start with foundation units. For four to five bands, tackle the medium units. And if you're at six to seven bands, you're ready for advanced content. With your bands identified, dive into SAT prep course materials. Use videos, articles, exercises, and quizzes to level up and aim for proficiency. Try unit tests and course challenges to shoot for mastery. Strategy two is the skills insight approach. Once you have your College Board scores from an online report, use the skills insight tool to zero in on specific skills within your performance band or challenge yourself with questions from a higher performance band. To access your scores, log into your College Board student account or use the big future school mobile app if you registered with your mobile number. The report will look a little different depending on if you're in the big future app or your College Board account. There are four content domains for each section of the test. The filled in part of each progress bar represents your level of mastery in that content domain and is called a performance band. The more performance bands that are filled in, the better you did. The online reports provide a performance band score which aligns to College Board skills insight tool. Click view skills and example questions in next score band on your report to access the skills insight tool. In skills insight, select your domain and performance band score. Then click go to see the skills and knowledge you typically can demonstrate based on that score band. Skills and questions in the next higher score band are the skills you should work on. Remember these two strategies, focused courses, and targeted skills practice work together to build your strengths and boost your score. Let's dive in and make each practice session count.
