Hello families, I'm Rachel. As parents, we all want to help our kids succeed. And with so many educational resources available, how do you know which one you can trust? That's where Khan Academy comes in. Khan Academy is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. While you might know us from our free online videos and practice exercises, our work with schools and districts is where we make the most significant impact. We've been trusted by educators and learners for over 15 years. And with the Khan Academy District Partnership, your child has access to valuable resources to help them learn anything. Our philosophy is built on mastery learning. This means that instead of just moving on to the next topic, your child will have the chance to fully grasp the concept before moving forward. This helps prevent learning gaps from forming and builds a strong foundation for future success. From powerful data and reporting, to expert support, to proven results, schools partner with Khan Academy for a number of reasons, all designed to help your child and their teachers thrive. Teachers and school administrators get detailed, real-time reports that help them quickly understand where students are excelling and where they might need extra support. This data allows for targeted, small-group instruction and personalized learning plans. Our partnerships include dedicated support, professional learning, and an implementation plan tailored to the district's specific needs. And studies show that using Khan Academy for 30 minutes or more per week can accelerate student learning, as demonstrated by an increase of up to 20% on national assessments. At Khan Academy, we are always innovating, and Khanmigo, our AI-powered tutor for students and assistant for teachers, is helping students learn. Khanmigo is designed to act like a Socratic guide. It won't give your child the answer directly. Instead, it will ask thoughtful questions and provide hints that guide them to the solution on their own. This helps build critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of the material. Here's what makes Khanmigo special for your child. It's an always-available, one-on-one tutor that's integrated with our world-class content library. Whether your child is stuck on a math problem, needs help with an essay, or wants to explore a new topic, Khanmigo is there to help. As a nonprofit, we prioritize learning and safety. Khanmigo is built with specific guardrails and moderation alerts, so teachers and administrators can see a student's chat history and ensure their safety. Khanmigo helps with more than just homework. It can serve as a writing coach, help students practice for debates, or even engage them in conversation with historical figures. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, Khanmigo helps your child use AI in a safe, responsible, and empowering way. As the parent of a student in a Khan Academy district, you have the ability to observe your child's learning on Khan Academy and interactions with Khanmigo through a parent account. To connect with your child's account, simply create your own free parent account. Once you have a parent account ready to go, click on Add a Child and choose Yes when asked if your child already has an account. Next, input the email address for your child's school account and hit Send Invite. Your child will now have a notification in their account to accept your invite, and you will now have access to view your child's learning on Khan Academy. With Khan Academy districts, you can be confident that your child's school is providing them with a trusted, effective, and innovative learning solution, one that helps them build a strong academic foundation, and prepare for a future with AI.
