This is Sal and Vi. Hey, this is Vi and Sal. And we said we were going to answer questions about this joining of forces between Vi and the Khan Academy. So we're here at the Google Moderator site and we're looking at the most popular questions and we're going to try to answer as many of these as possible. Alright, let's get started. So first one, do you have plans to keep your stuff separate or are you going to intertwine stuff? I'm not exactly sure. I mean, we would like to do some sort of collaborations. I think for the most part though, the answer is we're going to be keeping our stuff separate. I'm going to be doing my thing. Sal is going to be doing his Sal thing. But hopefully also maybe we'll... Yeah, you know, this is what's fun about it is we'll just kind of see what makes sense. But yeah, Vi is going to keep doing what Vi does and I'll keep doing what I do. But we will, you know, there have been a couple of videos that we did together and people like those. So we might experiment with things like that. Who knows? Maybe I might experiment with the Vi style video. Maybe Vi will experiment with a Sal style video. But we don't know. That's not part of, you know, we'll just see what happens there. But for the most part, we'll just keep doing what we're doing. We do eventually want to kind of integrate them in some way that you could experience Vi's videos on her own or my videos on their own. But it would be neat if, you know, Vi does a really cool video on Fibonacci numbers and then I come in later and I do another video or we go deeper into the math on it or whatever else. So we do want to have experiences on the Khan Academy that incorporate both of our videos and the exercises. Yeah, I'd like to get more links between them as far as following you, following up more in depth and more rigorously on things that I maybe mentioned just for a second. Because the content is already there in many cases. We just don't have the interface. Yeah. And the other thing, and we mentioned this on the announcement, is that Vi has already been kind of working on projects and leading projects. And I think it'll be interesting to see, you know, if Vi helps think about some of the more exercise interactive parts of the site, too. Yeah. And Sal conveniently has connections to all these schools that have all these students who, since they learned so fast on Khan Academy, they have all this free time to try out some projects. Hopefully they learn fast. But yeah, that's the idea. Well, they have. They have. It looks like it's a... We went to visit a school that finished their unit and we're like, what do we do with all this extra time? We bring Vi in. We did. We made stuff with balloons. We had fun. Very cool. Very cool. Our next question. All right. Will Vi continue to post doodling in math class and similar videos? Yes. Yes. All right. Will you start doing college level courses? I see. Okay. I see you have DiffieQ, but what about things such as combinatorics and topology? The answer is yes. And I'm going to protest the whole college level idea there. Yes. It's an arbitrary division. Basically, do we want to do fun stuff? Yes. It's an arbitrary division, but beyond DiffieQ, we already do have obviously a lot of calculus, linear algebra. The chemistry, biology is roughly a first year college level. We have physics. We have working on microeconomics right now. So yes, we're going to do many things in college level. But as Vi pointed out, it really should just be interesting stuff that people want to work on. And I think corridor philosophy, I think both of our philosophy is if it's interesting, it should be interesting to almost anybody. Yes. Cool stuff is cool. Exactly. All right. Which books? Oh, we can turn and look right at the books on your bookshelf. Yes. You have a large art of problem solving. Yeah. Which I also have. Uh-huh. Which I also have. Actually, most of my books are in boxes. I just had them shipped to my apartment and I brought them in here. Vi is still moving. My favorite go-to resource is probably like Wikipedia. Part of the math and computer science sections of Wikipedia are actually very up to date by top people in the field who are constantly going in there and really making sure it's a great resource. So some of those pages are really kept. Well kept. Well, yeah. I 100% agree. I mean, Wikipedia sometimes gets a bad name because it's like, oh, anyone can edit it. What is this thing? But the reality is, I do have a lot of textbooks on my bookshelf and I do look at them to make sure that I'm kind of covering all the topics. But Wikipedia, to Vi's point, often does have some of the best nuanced information because it is being updated by all of these people who have intuitions on things. Intuition. And just the people who are writing papers about it will go to Wikipedia and make sure that the information is there. And random stuff that's not in any formal curricula, which is still interesting. So that's resource number one. And then the trick is then to follow up with whatever looks interesting. So I recently got a Kindle because when I want to research something, I want the information now. So I can just download it. I can just have whatever book I want to do research on. So I do have a large library, but more important is finding whatever is new and that you need. 100% agree. 100% agree. The next one. Where are we? Okay. Are you considering making more computer science videos? They were fascinating for me, but I would like to see how computers actually work. Thanks for everything and good luck with your projects. Simple answer is yes. John Resig is working on tools to make better computer science videos. So we've been holding off for those tools where we can kind of make interactive videos. But the simple answer is computer science, we think, is very important. And I think what you're also asking is kind of more for computer engineering, how computers actually work. And they will be on Khan Academy eventually. So it won't be tomorrow, but they'll be there. All right, Vi, does this mean the end of your signature video? No, it doesn't. I'm going to keep on doing my signature videos, which I have been actually. You've seen, I've just uploaded a video yesterday. Yes. So Vi has actually been here for a few months. No. No, a month. A month. So her last video was while she was here. And it was just as, I think, no different or even better. And it seems like I was here forever. Everyone in the office was like, really? You've only been here a month? Yes, no, but Vi will hopefully keep doing what she's been doing. Let's see. Do you have any guidelines for teachers? I'm sorry, I love your work. Is this specific to Vi or is this for both of us? I think this is more for... Do you have any guidelines for teachers to use your videos in the school settings? They're perfect from... Well, we can both answer. I think yours are more perfect for students who suffer from anxiety. Actually, maybe both of us in very different ways. In very different ways. Go ahead. Well, you get comments from a lot of students who just... I mean, Sal has this calming voice. He goes through things and you can go back, you can listen again. Sal's not going to go off onto the next topic if you don't want him to. Yeah, no, exactly. I think where I hit the anxiety is you've got something that some other person are saying you need to learn soon. Whether it's some exam or you're in a course and you're lost and Khan Academy hopefully helps there. Vi instills a wonder, which every now and then a Khan Academy video does, but Vi does it all the time. She's intense wonder in her videos and I think it kind of awakens you to mathematics. I think the thing, the only thing I can think of with my videos is not anxiety producing is that it's okay to not understand everything. We're just going to completely overload with lots of cool stuff and you don't have to understand it all. You can just enjoy it. Yes, no, completely agree. So hopefully overall the net, the total anxiety in the world will be going down, which is a good thing. All right, so let's see. On the guidelines part, I mean, I've given some talks about this and advice on some projects and things. I think the general idea is to use videos in any way possible that can make class time as stimulating and interactive as possible. Very high level. Yeah, teachers have used both of our videos in tons of different ways. And we want to hear about them because then if we think that there's neat practices teachers are doing, we'd love to share them with other teachers. Let's see, next question. Do you plan on adding a wiki-like section to each video so users can add problems and exercises or facts and tips? Yes, it won't be exactly a wiki-like section, but we're going to have more conceptual questions associated with videos. And it won't be limited to just the traditional Khan Academy videos. It could be VISE videos. We're probably going to bring in a few other people to make videos. The simple answer is yes. There will be other content that is associated with videos in the not too far future. And let's see, a recreational math channel. I feel like that's kind of what I am already. Yes. Interesting weird things in math that may not be particularly useful in everyday life. You know, it's very hard to find interesting things in math that don't end up being useful eventually somehow. It's a well-known oddity of mathematics that no matter what you do, it's going to end up being useful even if it's... Yes. No, the example, I mean, prime numbers is the best one. Euclid was studying it thousands of years ago. A periodic tiling is not a good example. And then we discover quasi-crystals. Yes, yes. Yeah, prime numbers and cryptography and the way cicadas come out of the ground and, yeah, so predators can't get... Yeah, so, yes, I agree. But the recreational math channel is, yeah, that's what Vi does. There's some kind of kind of videos that are in that direction. And we actually are probably going to bring in a few other people who are generally focused in that type of thing. So, yes, the simple answer is yes. All right, now we can't scroll down anymore. Let me make my window a little bit. It's my bounding boxes. I'm having issues. All right. So let's... Okay, so this last... Let's get the last one on this page. Are you producing... Are you planning to produce a knowledge map for non-mathematical subject matter? While most subjects are non-linear, there's often logic on the connection, but I think they're helpful to digitize it. Yes, I mean, we're going to have... We're actually in the process of rethinking the knowledge map altogether. But the goal is where it's appropriate to have some type of map structure so that people can understand how one concept ties to another. Do you want to finish this video and then do another one, or do you want to keep going in this one? Oh, I don't know. We can keep going. We can just keep going forever. We have hundreds of questions, right? Yeah, yeah. We can do all day. All day. Okay, so let's just... Okay, so there we go. So that's the review. No one's forced to keep watching this video. No one's forced to keep watching this video. It's okay, you can read if you want. This is a very optional video. I think this one's for you. All right. Val, you did an excellent video using a foldable manipulative. Thank you. To prove the Pythagorean theorem, will there be more... Yes, I would love to get more... Origami, there's so much cool mathematics in what you can do with paper. And also I love paper because it's there. Any teacher who maybe doesn't have resources or budget to get materials has it. So I guess in my most recent video, I just had like a tiny paper manipulative, which was how to make a certain angle-a-tron out of a piece of paper. And I'd like to do more puzzles like that. Yes. And let's see, next one. Will there be a possibility for adding upper division college courses to the website? Thermodynamics, quantum physics, material science, polymer science, et cetera. The simple answer is yes. I also think there's been this project announced by MIT, MITx. I think they're going to be tackling a lot of that stuff too. And I think a lot of what we might be able to do is kind of get people ready for... So maybe we'll introduce people to a lot of these ideas and then they'll be able to go even deeper with some of the MITx stuff, which will be at the undergraduate and the graduate level. But the simple answer, we do want to do these things. And it's a combination of our own bandwidth and finding people who can kind of do them and consistent with kind of how we want to relate to students. All right. There was a mention of activities to help boost interest in various... Are these details of how these will function yet? We're not... Well, we're experimenting with them and we are running a summer camp and Vi's been a big part of that. Yeah. And actually, later this week, Milly and I are going to just do a whole bunch of projects around the office and start to see what we want to maybe bring into the summer camp. So that's going to be our testing ground for activities. And once we do them at the summer camp, we hope to document them well, even possibly with video, and then share them with anyone who's interested in doing them and eventually even associating them with specific concepts on OnCon Academy that, hey, you know, people who are... Maybe you do this project before you learn the concept so that you have motivation or once you learn the concept, you do the project or you do them simultaneously or whatever else or this is just a random thing that's not part of any formal curriculum but we think it's interesting and we'll get people excited about math or science. Who knows? Yeah, and there's always tons of ways to follow up from projects and just to be able to link to content that exists and that you know you have there. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay. The Con Academy has proven it can educate people. Vi Howard has proven she can entertain people with math. Do you guys see a concrete synergy or is this an experiment? So, you know, even the proven... I think we're continually trying to prove, you know, and the word educate, this is a very open-ended thing. What does it mean to really educate people? Have you finished educating everyone? Yeah, we're done. Check, check. Let's move to healthcare or something. No, it's... So, you know, I think this is a flattering... I think Vi Howard has proven more that she can entertain people than we've proven that... Although, you know, I think the way I feel about the proof is that, yes, we get many testimonials from people who have used Con Academy to kind of turn their understanding around. So, that's something. We've had good data coming out of the pilots. But we think it's, you know, this word educate is such a broad thing and that we can always push the envelope and we can always ask for more. So, there's a long journey to go. But in terms of the second part, it's both. It is a concrete synergy. You know, this isn't like, hey, let's try this out and see what happens. I mean, hopefully, you know, we're all here in 20 years and we, you know, a bunch of videos later and millions and millions of people have experienced this stuff. But we will also experiment with things. Yes, I think you answered that one perfectly. Thank you. All right, now... What presentation aspects or style elements of Vai's video will the Con Academy look to implement in their other videos? As far as I know, Sal is going to do what he does. I'm going to do what I do, but, you know, I think it's good to experiment. I mean, I think I will, you know... Doodle more? Maybe doodle more. Talk faster. Talk faster, maybe edit a little. We'll see. We'll see. I think it could be interesting. We just had an intern who made a video about his experience here in a very Vai heart style. And it was pretty... It was really awesome. Fun and intense. It was, yeah. I mean, some people complain you talk too slow. Some people complain I talk too fast. Yes. So I think it's good to have people there. Yes, I think it's good. And YouTube has this double speed, half speed thing. It does? Oh, yeah, so people should be able to get whatever they... I should try that. I bet I sound amazing. It doesn't change the pitch. It doesn't change the pitch. It doesn't change the pitch. It's, yeah, it's amazing. So let's see. It's wonderful that you give us intuition of many mathematical concepts, but you plan on making videos on the rigor and formal basis of mathematics, like axiomatic set theory. The simple answer is yes. We want to go deep in math and science. I think... Yes. One of my next plans, I really want to just get to the, I guess, the formal basis of mathematics. I think a lot of people are missing that, and in school, they take kind of special cases of things. And that's the real mathematics. And actually, I think a lot of students would find things like topology or axiomatic set theory on some level more intuitive than what often goes on in algebra class or pre-algebra class. Yeah, or what we call algebra class in school. Yes, exactly. It's really just an algebra. It's an algebra. Exactly, exactly. I think some of the stuff you can actually teach to very young children, and they'd find it very intuitive, and they would realize that math is actually highly creative. Yeah. There's... Oh, man. All right. I'm excited to do those videos. All right. So this... Will Vi hang out at the office from like nine to five days a week and make videos where we'll just occasionally show up? I guess the question basically is, is this a full-time job for Vi? Yeah, I've been kind of doing the nine to five things so far. I mean, sometimes I show up late, stay late, leave early, stuff like that. But I find it actually really helpful to have a little more structure in my life that I have like an office to show up to that's separate from home because working from home has a lot of inherent problems in just your schedule. Yeah, or when you have crying babies at home. That's the other... I don't have any... No, not yet. That's not so much of a... No. Well, we try not... We don't have time cards or anything like that. People want you to do it over here at your vacation policy as we have a minimum vacation policy. Yes. Not a maximum vacation policy. So, yes, we... It's kind of crazy. But everyone here is very self-motivated. Yes. It's people who want to be doing cool stuff, and this is a great place to do it. So, yeah, I like showing up nine to five. Yeah. So, we're not forcing Vi to show up nine to five. She has chosen to show up for nine to five. Mm-hmm. All right. Question for... This is for you. Oh, for Vi, if you could add or change anything about the Khan Academy's exercise tree, what would it be? Yeah, that whole thing is getting reworked, and I think that's for good reason. It's... It's large and unwieldy now. It's unwieldy. It's very good-like. You can get these lines. Yes, yes. So, yeah. So, I mean, Vi is part of a large number of people who are including many teachers and students who are... We're rethinking what that exercise tree will look like. Yeah, so we're in the process of that. And if you have ideas, send them our way. We have ideas too, but, you know, it doesn't hurt to get more. That's very true. Yeah. Okay. Biochemistry or quantum mechanics? Do you know anything about quantum mechanics? A little bit, but not enough to... Okay, you can teach that one. I have to go deeper. I have to... So, it could be... So, I personally could touch on some of the basic ideas, but I don't like to make a video unless I can really give someone the intuition for it. We are talking to some people who are, you know, experts in the field, and what we're trying to see is, one, if they have the bandwidth to do it, and also if they kind of have the... They are also... They're good at giving the intuition, and if they are, we'd love them to make some quantum mechanics. Biochemistry, same thing. You know, we've kind of touched on it already in the... You know, kind of the first year bio-course stuff with, you know, the Krebs cycle, that's biochemistry, but... It's important for us that it's not biochemistry, not... I taught biochemistry in college, and I didn't enjoy the class because it felt like it was a lot of... There wasn't a lot of intuition there, and I suspect that there can be intuition in that class, so if we can find someone, or if we can figure out a way to teach it ourselves with intuition, and then... But the simple answer is, the intent is there, it might not be any time soon. Yeah. It would take me a while to get up to biochemistry. Yes. All right. Maybe this will be the last one, we're at 20 minutes. All right. What are some of the innovations and interactive learning tools you plan on developing together in the future? My favorite interactive learning tool is always something physical you do, that you make. Yeah. Yeah. At Klin Academy, the great thing about that as a learning tool is that you can... When it comes to classrooms and teaching, you've got now more time that students can do these interactive making stuff together. No matter where they are, separately on various videos and learning, they can still... Yeah. No, that's exactly right. Part of bringing Vi here was literally this... We have seen in the pilot classes that time has been getting freed up and that teachers and students are eager to explore other things, and Vi has been created just thinking of good ideas. I think there will be... When you talk about interactive learning tools, I think what you will see over time is... You're going to see the exercise modules become more manipulative in a virtual sense. You're not going to actually hold the thing, but you're going to be able to move things around. What we keep telling ourselves is we want the exercises eventually, maybe all to do things that you could never do, that you could not have done with the traditional textbook, where you're moving things around. But Vi is absolutely right. We think that that's just part of it. You add that with a physical experience and you actually are manipulating things. Paper manipulatives, like someone mentioned, I think that's an awesome idea to do a lot more of those, because it's just so... I don't know what the word is. Tactile. Just easy to get the material. You can just do that. Oh, right. Accessible. So accessible. Accessible, right. Very good. All right. Well, maybe we'll do this in the future. Yeah. We should do semi-regularly. We could. Very good. Well, thank you for your questions. This is exciting. Yes. Thank you all. And happy new year. Oh, okay.
