Hi, this is Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy, and I just wanted to announce our second annual talent search. As you may know, Khan Academy, we're a not-for-profit with a mission of a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere, and part of that is creating the content that can reach students from kindergarten all the way through early college and all of the core academic subjects, and that content is videos, it's articles and exercises. And the reason why we do the talent search is we're looking for folks who can really connect with students on those subjects. And so this year, we're doing the talent search again, and we're especially looking at core academic subjects that aren't on Khan Academy already, or where Khan Academy does not already have a significant offering. I encourage you to go to the talent search website to get a little bit more detail there. This is a really exciting thing for us. There are going to be prizes for the finalists, but more importantly, it's a way for us to foster more people getting involved with content creation, which I think all of you will enjoy, and for a way for us to discover new talent. And last year, out of the finalists, two have actually had content creation contracts with Khan Academy, including Grant and David. Hi, everyone, my name is Grant Sanderson. I was one of the talent search winners from last year. I now make multivariable calculus videos and some other content for Khan Academy. And I just have to say, as someone who cares about reaching students and who cares about addressing needs like that, I can't imagine a better place to be than here. And that's not just because you can reach a lot of people, but what the Khan Academy folk around here care about is just genuinely helping students. So I am the grammar fellow at Khan Academy. I am very passionate about grammar. And I'm curious to know what you're excited about. What are your big passions? What do you love to think about? What do you love to tell people about? What do people like learning from you? Is it macroeconomics? Is it business theory? Is it psychology? Whatever it is, whatever your passion is, put it into a video and send it to us. So please make your videos, have fun with them. Think about how you can connect with the world and send us your submissions by August 1st.
