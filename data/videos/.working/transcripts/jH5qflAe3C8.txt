Let's now actually apply Newton's law of cooling. So just to remind ourselves, if capital T is the temperature of something in Celsius degrees and lowercase t is time in minutes, we can say that the rate of change, the rate of change of our temperature with respect to time is going to be proportional, and I'll write a negative k right over here. If we assumed our constant k is positive, then a negative k is going to be proportional to the difference between the temperature of our thing and the ambient temperature in the room. And once again, why did I have a negative there? Well, because if the temperature of our thing is larger than the temperature of the room, we would expect that we would be decreasing in temperature, that we would have a negative rate of change. That temperature should be decreasing with time. If on the other hand, our temperature is lower than the ambient temperature of the room, then this thing is going to be negative, but we would want a positive rate of change of temperature. Things would be warming up, and so that's why a negative of a negative would give you the positive. So this right over here, this differential equation, we already saw it in the previous video on Newton's law of cooling, and we even saw a general solution to that. And the general solution that I care about, because we're now going to deal with the scenario where we're putting something warm, or we're gonna put a warm bowl of oatmeal in a room temperature room. So given that, we're gonna assume the case that we saw in the last video, where our temperature is greater than or equal to the ambient temperature. And in that situation, our general solution boiled down to, it boiled down to temperature as a function of time is equal to some constant times e to the negative kT, negative kT, negative kT plus our ambient temperature. Once again, we figured this out in the last video. Now let's actually apply it. So I said we were dealing with the scenario where our temperature is greater than or equal to the ambient temperature, so let's assume we're in a scenario, let's assume a scenario where our ambient temperature is 20 degrees Celsius, and we assume that doesn't change, that the room is just large enough that even if something is warmer is put into it, that the ambient temperature does not change. And let's say that the thing that we put in it, our warm bowl of oatmeal, let's say it starts off, the moment we put in the room, at time equals zero, is 80 degrees Celsius. Now let's say we also know, just from previous tests, that after two minutes, after two minutes, it gets to 60 degrees Celsius. So we also know that T of two is 60 degrees Celsius. And given all of this information right over here, using Newton's Law of Cooling, and using all of this information we know about how bowls of oatmeal that started at this temperature have cooled in the past, we wanna know how long will it take, how many minutes will it have to pass when you put an 80 degree bowl of oatmeal in the room, how many minutes have to pass in order for it to get to 40 degrees using this model. So let me write that down. So how long, how many minutes, minutes for, or let me say to cool, to cool, to cool to 40 degrees Celsius. And so I encourage you to pause the video now and try to figure it out. So I'm assuming you have paused the video and you have had your go at it. And the key is to use all of this information right over here to solve for the constants C and K. And then once you know that, you essentially have described your model and then you can apply it to solve for the time that gets you to a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. So let's do that. So the first thing we know is the ambient temperature is 20 degrees Celsius. So this right over here, this right over here is 20 degrees. And so the most obvious thing to solve for, or to apply is what happens with T of zero? And what's neat about T of zero, when T equals zero, this exponent is zero, E to the zero power is one. And so T of zero is essentially going to simplify to C plus 20 degrees. Let me actually write that down. So T of zero, which we already know is 80 degrees, we already know is 80 degrees Celsius. And I'm just gonna write 80. I'm just gonna write 80. We'll assume it's in degrees Celsius. That is going to be equal to, that is going to be equal to, when T equals zero, this, the E to the negative, or E to the zero is just gonna be one. So it's going to be equal to C plus 20. And so if you wanna solve for C, you just subtract 20 from both sides of this equation. And we are left with 80 minus 20 is 60 is equal to C. 60 is equal to C. So we were able to figure out C. So let's figure out, let's write what we know right now. So we know that T, and we do that in that magenta color. We know that T of T, it's confusing, uppercase T of lowercase T, temperature is a function of time, is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to, let me do that same color, 60E, 60E to the negative KT. Negative KT plus 20, plus our ambient temperature. Plus our ambient temperature. Now we need to solve for K. And we could use this information right over here to solve for K. T of two is equal to 60 degrees. So if we make T is equal to two, this thing is going to be 60 degrees. So let me write that down. So we could, let me write it over here, so I have some space. So we have 60 is equal to 60 is equal to 60, is equal to 60E to the negative KT. All this color switching takes time. E to the negative KT plus, oh, let me be careful, that's at time two. So that's E to the negative K times two. That's at time equals two. Or I could write that E to the negative two K. E to the negative two K. And then of course we have our plus 20. And then we have our plus 20. And now we just have to solve for K. And once again at any point, if you feel inspired to do so, I encourage you to try to solve it on your own. All right, so let's do this. If we subtract 20 from both sides, we get 40 is equal to 60E, E to the negative two K. Negative two K. Now divide both sides by 60. You are left with two thirds. 40 divided by 60 is two thirds, is equal to E to the negative two K. All this color changing takes work. Let me know if y'all want me to keep changing. I enjoy changing colors. It just keeps it interesting on the screen. But anyway, so E to the negative two K. Actually let me scroll down a little bit so I have some more real estate to work with. And now I could take, let's see, I could take the natural log of both sides. And so I'll have the natural log, natural log of two thirds is equal to, the natural log of E to the negative two K is just going to be negative two K. That's the whole reason why I took the natural log of both sides. And then to solve for K, I divide both sides by negative two. I get K is equal to negative one half, negative one half natural log, natural log of two thirds. I just swap sides. Natural log of two thirds. Let me do that since I kept the colors going so long. Let me keep it that way. Natural log of two thirds. And so we have solved for all of the constants. So now we can rewrite this thing right over here. We can rewrite it as, so we decided for a mini drum roll here. We're not completely done yet. We get T of T is equal to 60 E, E to the negative K. Well, negative K, the negative and negative is going to be positive. It's going to be one half natural log of two thirds. So one half natural log of two thirds. Negative K, so negative of a negative. So one half natural log of two thirds. Which actually will be a negative value. Two thirds is less than E. So you're going to have a natural log of it. It's going to be negative. So it makes you feel good that the temperature is going to be going down over time. And so plus, oh, times T, times T plus 20. Plus 20. And so now all we have to do is we have to forget what T gets us to a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. So let's solve for that. So if we want this to be 40, 40 is equal to, and actually now I'm just going to stick to one color as we march through this part. So 40 is going to be equal to 60E to the one half natural log of two thirds T power plus 20. Now let's see, we can subtract 20 from both sides. We get 20 is equal to 60E, all that crazy business. One half natural log of two thirds times T. Now we can divide both sides by 60 and we get one third, 20 divided by 60 is one third, is equal to E to the one half natural log of two thirds times T. Now let's see, we can take the natural log of both sides. So we get the natural log of one third is equal to one half natural log of two thirds times T, and then home stretch to solve for T, you just divide both sides by one half natural log of two thirds. So we get T is equal to this, which is the natural log of one third divided by one half natural log of two thirds. Well if you divide by one half, that's the same thing as multiplying by two, and then you're going to divide by natural log, natural log of two thirds. Two thirds. Now let's see if this actually makes a sensical answer. So let me get a calculator out. Actually I could just use Google here. So I had, actually I already forgot, I already forgot what it was. Natural at one, so I have natural log of one third over natural log of two thirds and the whole thing times two. So I can type, I can type two, two times the natural log of, natural log of one third, natural log of one third divided by, divided by the natural log of two thirds. Let's see what Google gets us. All right, it didn't, what did I, where, how did I mess up? So this is equal to two times the natural, oh okay, messed up the parentheses. Let me make this clear. The natural log of one third, divided by the natural log of two thirds. And then there you go. If we were to round to the nearest hundredth, it would be 5.42. So 5.42 minutes. Remember everything we were doing were in minutes. So this right over here, this is approximately equal to 5.42, 5.42 minutes. And we are done. That's how long it will take us to cool to 40 degrees.
