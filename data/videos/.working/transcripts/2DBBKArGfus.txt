I have an interesting rate problem here, and at first it's a little daunting because it has fractions, but then when we work through it step by step, hopefully it'll feel a little bit more intuitive. So it says Calvin cleans 3 fifths of his bathroom with 1 third of a bottle of cleaning solution. At this rate, what fraction of the bottle of cleaning solution will Calvin use to clean his entire bathroom? And like always, I encourage you to pause the video and try to take a stab at this yourself. So as I mentioned, it's a little bit, 3 fifths of his bathroom with 1 third of a bottle. How do we think about this? And what my brain does is I like to say, well, how would we like to answer the question? What fraction of the bottle of cleaning solution will Calvin use to clean his entire bathroom? So what we wanna figure out is, we wanna figure out how many bottles, so question mark bottles per, let me write it this way. So we wanna figure out, he uses a certain number up with that question mark, bottles per bathroom. If we knew this, then we have the answer to the question. If this would, this might be, I don't know, 2 fifths of a bottle per bathroom. It might be 2 bottles per bathroom. But if we know whatever this question mark is, then we know the answer. How many bottles does it need to take to clean a bathroom? Or what fraction of a bottle? We don't know. They're hinting that it's a fraction of a bottle. But how much of a bottle, or how many bottles per bathroom? Or another way to think about this, if we wanted to express it as a rate more mathematically, we could say question mark bottles, bottles per bathroom. Bathroom. And the reason why this is helpful, it makes it clear that, look, we wanna figure out, we wanna take, our units tell us that we wanna divide the number of bottles, or the fraction of a bottle it takes to clean the number of bathrooms, or a certain fraction of the bathrooms. And they tell us over here, they tell us that he's able to take 1 third of a bottle, he's able to take 1 third of a bottle, so I could write it here, 1 third of a bottle to clean, to clean 3 fifths of a bathroom. 3 fifths of a bathroom. 3 fifths of a bathroom. So hopefully it's clear now why this was helpful. We say, okay, we wanna take how many bottles it takes to clean a certain number of bathrooms. 1 third of a bottle can clean 3 fifths of a bathroom. It makes it clear that we need to take the 1 third and divide it by 3 fifths, because then we're going to get bottles per bathroom, we're gonna get the rate. We're not gonna get bathrooms per bottle, we're gonna get bottles per bathroom, which is what we care about. What fraction of the bottle will it take to clean entire bathroom, to clean one entire bathroom? So now we just have to take 1 third and divide it by 3 fifths. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, gonna write it this way, 1 third divided by 3 fifths, divided by 3 fifths, and the units are going to be bottles per bathroom. I'll write it like that. Bottles, or since, if we know that it's going to be a fraction, we can just say bottle per bathroom. Bottle per bathroom. And so this is going to be the same thing as, well we're gonna have 1 third divided by 3 fifths, it's the same thing as 1 third times the reciprocal of 3 fifths. So 1 third times 5 thirds. 1 third times 5 thirds bottle per bathroom. So let me write that down. Bottle per bathroom. Bottle per bathroom, what is this going to be? Well we multiply the numerators, 1 times 5 is going to give us 5, and the denominator, 3 times 3 is ninths. So it's gonna be 5 ninths of a bottle, of a bottle per bathroom. Per bathroom, I wrote these a little bit further apart than I would want to, let me write that a little bit closer together. 5 ninths of a bottle per bathroom. So just as a reminder of what we did here, it could seem a little bit daunting, but we said, okay look, we want how much, what fraction of the bottle to clean his entire bathroom. So we care about bottles per bathroom, or since we're talking about a fraction, I guess we could just say bottle, some fraction of a bottle per bathroom. So it's bottle divided by bathrooms, that's gonna give us the correct rate. So it took 1 third of a bottle to clean 3 fifths of a bathroom, so you divide 1 third by 3 fifths, you get 5 ninths of a bottle per bathroom. So this question mark right over here, that is 5 ninths. It takes 5 ninths of a bottle of cleaning solution to clean his entire bathroom.
