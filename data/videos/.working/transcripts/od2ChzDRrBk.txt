Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the not-for-profit Khan Academy. And if you are thinking about going to law school, know someone who is, or just care about equity of opportunity, I have some very exciting news. We are announcing, Khan Academy is announcing the availability of free test preparation for the LSAT, the Law School Admissions Test. This is a really big deal. Over 100,000 people who are aspiring lawyers take the LSAT every year, many of them paying for test prep that costs hundreds or even thousands of dollars. And you can imagine that hits a lot of young people's pocketbooks or even is inaccessible to many people. And what's especially exciting about our partnership to create the world's best preparation for the LSAT is that it's being done in conjunction with the makers of the test, the Law School Admissions Council. So we're very excited about this. We think it's going to help empower a new generation of lawyers and it follows in the tradition of work that we've done with the college board around the SAT, which over three million students have taken advantage of our free test prep. Here at Khan Academy, we have a mission of a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. And we're excited about increasing the level of opportunity for aspiring law students starting soon. Thank you.
