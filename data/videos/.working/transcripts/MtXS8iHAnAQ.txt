All right, everybody, welcome back or welcome and hello. My name is Danielle Sullivan and Barbara Campbell is my co-host today. We are going to be presenting to you on how to enhance teaching with data informed planning with Khan Academy. And I, oh, there we go. I just, here we go. And there we go. So I just want to remind you of our partnership. Again, we are doing the summer learning series. We've already done a series of webinar on the student facing tool, KhanMigo Socratic Tutor, the teacher tools, the SAT courses. Today we're talking about data. Next Tuesday we'll be writing specifically and then the final session will be all about learning paths and how you can use that if you are a map growth district. So I would like to introduce or reintroduce your New Hampshire support team. Again, my name is Danielle. I am the senior regional manager of Northeast District Partnerships. Barbara is your New Hampshire district success manager and you'll be learning a lot more from Crystal coming soon. She's our New Hampshire professional learning specialist. And again, we are here to show you all of these tools in a safe, responsible manner and how we're supporting educators of New Hampshire to empower their students to use this in a safe way. Last week we talked about SAT. Who was on the SAT course? Thumbs up. That was helpful, right? Sarah, like really, she was great. She knows so much. So now I want you to, I'm going to pass my share screen over to Barbara who is going to start by sharing the district's data and then I will share more data after Barbara. All right, Barbara, take it away. Okay. Good morning. Give me just a second here. Share my video. I'm sorry, I need to get rid of a toolbar that's blocking. There we go. We are not seeing your screen, Barbara. Oh, there we go. Success. Okay. Yes, success. So good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining. I'm going to go ahead and go through what would be the administrator dashboard. So this is for administrators. We do have a teacher dashboard and then students kind of have their own dashboard, but I just want to start out by talking about as an administrator, this is what you would see. And so once you log in, this is the administrator dashboard. Now I want to point out one thing. Sometimes you are rostered as multiple roles within Khan Academy. And so if it doesn't automatically go to this is what you see, go over here and make sure that you select administrator dashboard and then that will pop up. So if you log in and you're like, whoa, this isn't the screen I'm looking for. It might just simply be because you maybe have a teacher role. So that's one of my tips and tricks to find exactly what you need for the dashboard. On the first page, this is a fairly new view. And what we've done is we've combined a lot of the information in the reports and tried to give you a snapshot or a picture, if you will, of what's going on in your district. One of the things that you know, if you have multiple schools, you can, this is at the district level or I can go in and I can select just individual schools if that's something that I want to do. So one of the first thing you're going to see here, well, the very first thing I digress is right underneath the all schools are resources. And this is one of the things that a lot of times people tend to overlook. Please, these resources are great. They go over each of the reports. And so this is a place where if I'm not available or you're just thinking, I don't remember where that's at. Once you start out, this is where administrators can go in and get some help. So the first thing you see in the administrator dashboard is an activation graph. And so what this tells you, and this is the activation is really important right toward the beginning of the school year, because it gives you an idea exactly how things are going within your district. So it will show you that you have 100 percent of your kids rostered. So there's 465 students rostered and they set up an account. There's 65 percent of the students who they set up an account. And that comes from the teacher. The teacher actually has made an assignment for them. And so then then the start of an activity is that the student has actually logged in and started a specific activity that the teacher has assigned. So you can also, as you're looking at the dashboard, go in and click on View Report. And so I can see the total number of teachers, if their account's been activated, the number of students, how many students have been activated, meaning how many students have had an activity assigned, and then how many students have started an activity. Once again, you can filter by schools or anything that has a carrot beside it or is blue and underlined gives you more information. So now I can go in and look at the individual teachers and see where they're at. So it kind of makes sense for the teachers who have not activated. Their account, there's not going to be any activity in their student accounts. So that's pretty much the whole activation. There are two different ways that you can get. We can go back to the home page. And there was that view report. You can also go into activation. And you can see the same type of information by school, by grade, and by teachers. So there's two different ways of looking at it. The next thing we see is skills to proficient. And so this tells you how many students, there's the average line. And this is not a representative school of what we want our schools to do. Danielle and I were just talking about that, that the sandbox isn't necessarily the greatest thing in the world. It's not as robust as we would like it to be. But what you see is this is the number of skills, the average. And then these are skills to proficient, the average skills to proficient for each week. So let's say this was a good week and they had two skills was the average that they had done within that week. So always notice the time frames because they are important. That's the one thing that I would really point out is because some of these are year today. Some of them are weekly. And then you can go in and actually get a feel for where your school is year to date. Once again, the skills to proficient, you can click on view report. And so here is how you can see progress by school. Up here at the top, these are the filters. So you can set a custom date range or you can do it for the seven days, a full week, previous 30 days. You can do all schools, all grade levels, or you can pick just one and you can pick subject areas. So let's say I know that the majority of my students, I want to look at the math progress. I'm going to be talking with my math leads. And so I want to look at exactly how all my schools are doing it just in math. And so there you can see the same information you saw for combined just simply for math and how they're doing at each school. Now, once again, blue and underlined, I can go in and dive a little deeper. And look to see how each teacher is doing. And then there's the carrot. That teacher has two courses. So I can dig drill down into the course level. And then there's another carrot. And there I can actually see the individual students and their progress. So this is nice for an administrator. You might not go down to the student level all the time. But if you have questions about something or somebody asks you a specific question, this is how you can drill all the way down into the individual student. And then the teacher sees the same type of information. They just don't have the administrator dashboard. But this would be the same type of progress report that a teacher would see. And so now if I wanted to say I want to just do, let's not say I want to do math, but I can do say digital SAT prep. And the one thing you have to remember, you always have to click on apply. No, there's no report for digital SAT. So they haven't done that course. So that's the skills and the progress. And once again, I got it from the skills to proficient, but you can also expand this. And you can once again, instead of filtering like we did, you can see it by force, by school, cumulative, by grade level. And once again, when you're in these different views here, the date ranges and the school grades and subject, all those filters are still available to you. And one of the things that I've noticed is when you actually, when you, when it says show only active students, that means students who are active and have started. So this right here, this total here shows me number of students rostered. And so now if I click only my active students, this is a more representative view of what the kids who are, who have actually been assigned an assignment are doing. When you uncheck it, that shows you every student that's rostered and how they're doing. So it figures into the averages and sometimes it can make it a little wonky. So I think the best thing is to go in and make sure that you're showing only active students. And then also sometimes you're going to have kids do work outside the course, just on their own. And so if this view right here shows you active students, teachers who have assigned a student a course and how those students are doing in that specific course. If I want to just see overall what the usage looks like, I can click on that. And I don't know that it changed, but sometimes you'll have students doing work that's outside of a course that you've assigned. They're just simply, they got interested in another course. So that's a way that you can see if they're using it outside of the actual coursework that a student or that teacher has assigned. Any questions in the chat, Danielle? Or anybody want to come off mute and ask any questions? The one thing I've learned is there's a million ways to get each place. So, and that's trying to make it user friendly, but if you're looking for something and it's taking you, like if you're on the homepage and you're like, that's skills are proficient, but I want to see it this way. I think expanding the menu bar over here sometimes can be helpful as well. This is helpful as just a one-stop shop. Say I'm not really going to be digging in that much to my data, but I want to see how students are doing. Next on this dashboard, we have ConMigo usage. And so this is how students are doing within ConMigo and how we aggregate that is the number of chats per student. And then, so we have three-tenths of a percent of my students active. So really there was only one student that was active in ConMigo and actually did a chat. But that student had, there was 14 back and forth. And then there were six messages. And this is all from the previous week. So this is a weekly report. So it's a little bit, don't get panicky if you're thinking, oh my gosh, I'm not seeing like cumulative because this is just simply a weekly report. But I can go in to ConMigo. Once again, I can go over here and I can look at usage and activity or I can go here and look for usage and activity. So if I want to look and see how my students are doing with ConMigo and for ConMigo, that means they have clicked the little ConMigo button and ConMigo is helping them somehow within either the coursework or something that you have assigned. So when I click on View Report, I see that there was one student who was active and they were in Alder Grove Middle School. So I'm going to expand that carrot. They were in Mr. Wright's class as opposed to Mr. Rong. And I can see that the student there is Philip Holland and they had one chat per student. And so you can see this. So that's a way you can monitor just overall what's going on with your students. But you can also monitor the same thing for teachers. And this dashboard is going to be blank. But what, just as in the high school here, you can go in and you can go in and see which teachers, just like you could with students, you can see active teachers and then chats and messages per chat. So this is a way that you can go through and say, oh, okay, are my teachers actually using ConMigo? The report that I really like is the Activity Report within ConMigo because usage is one thing, but I want to know what are they doing. And so, for example, here's that student, and Ignite My Curiosity is a choice for students within ConAcademy where they can say, Ignite My Curiosity and they can type in questions and get information on whatever they want. And so once again, you can break this down by schools and then you can do it for different date ranges. School year to date is going to stay the same. Our sandbox has just rolled over. That's why the data is a little bit sparse. For teachers, you will be able to see the same type of information. So teachers, and I'm just going to quickly show the teacher tools. So all of these teacher tools, so if a teacher spends some time in the class snapshot, when you go back to the reports, you will see the activity. Under Teachers, you will see the activity. So you'd see lesson plans, exit ticket, write a poem. So you would be able to start looking at what the teachers were actually doing, which is a great insight for administrators to kind of say, Oh, okay, it looks like these teachers are doing lesson plans. So these three teachers who have really seemed to embrace looking at lesson plans and see if maybe they can't do some type of presentation or a quick demo for some of their peers. So it's a great way to just see exactly what's going on within ConRigo. We also have, I'm going to go back to my administrator dashboard. So once again, there you see ConRigo and you see ConRigo there. And ConRigo is weekly. Most of the others are year to date, but then it gives you a weekly average over here on the left. So this is learning minutes, number of minutes that a student has actually spent in Con Academy. And so this shows you just a bar graph that shows you, you know, what's been 30 minutes or more. Or I can also go into like this bar and I can say, Oh, okay, from July 29th, this is August 4th. Twenty eight percent of my students at least were on it for 30 plus minutes. From one to 14 minutes, I had 46. And then from 15 to 29, I had 26. And so you can kind of look through and see exactly how, how are they spending, you know, where are they spending time and how much time are they spending? Because what we like to say is number of being consistent about usage is very important, but a number of minutes is important, but it's actually what they're doing when they're in the learning minutes. Because these learning minutes show you if a student has watched a video, any activity that they've done. So it's about time spent in Con Academy, but it's not necessarily about time spent on a course that's been assigned or time spent on an exercise that needs to be done. And then once again, over here, you can go in and you can start looking at progress by school and you can start looking at how they're doing and the number of learning minutes. And the last one is skills level that this shows performance on coursework that a teacher has assigned to a student within Con Academy. So what we talk about is we always say 60 skills is great within an entire school year. And so, and then the skills level that not only show you mastery, but it also, and this will show you the skills to proficient. This shows you skills level that and the difference is skills level that means that they're somewhere in a progression of getting too proficient or mastery. So it means that they've actually taken a course, maybe they didn't get proficient, but they've got attempted or that so you can see, are they progressing? And so once again, with the skills level that I can go in and see the progress by schools and look at the skills leveled up and then the skills to proficient. So leveled up, like I said, they're making some progress within the course. And so they've worked on 20 skills on average at Alder Grove Middle School. Students have worked on an average of 20 skills. They've leveled up 12 of those and they've actually gotten skills to proficient of eight. So let's go back to the home and then the other one last thing I well, a couple things I'm not to say one last thing, but we also have skills. And so this is a good report for your curriculum. Your curriculum people, maybe lead teachers and administrators as well. But I want to see in the concourse of algebra one at all of my schools, probably not grade three. So let's look at my ninth grade students. And I'm going to select the course. So it's my algebra one course. And I'm not going to worry about teachers. I want to see overall how my students are doing. And so this report, like I said, is very helpful for planning and just simply understanding what's going on within the curriculum. So here you can see all of the individual standards, the foundational. There's seven skills in the algebra foundations. And you can look and see how students are progressing through this information. So combining like terms with rational coefficients. That might be something maybe that's what they're working on now. And maybe in two weeks when you come back, you see that this looks a little more robust in the master proficient. But this is a great way to go in and see exactly how your kids are doing. When you click on this, you can tell there's 103 students total. I can go in and I can look at the 32 students that have mastered. So this is a I would say a little bit of an advanced report. But it's very, very powerful when you talk about making data driven instruct data, data driven decisions. When you start scrolling down like this, you can really go in and your numbers of solutions to equations challenge. You know, one year we were looking at some of our data and we're like, it's really low in geometry. Well, geometry was taught after the test was taken. So that's another thing to keep in mind is like, what's the pacing guide? The last thing I'm going to show you is course mastery. And mastery is what we want all the students to get to. There's proficient and there's mastery. Proficient means that they have got 100 percent on all the coursework that they've done. Mastery means that they were able again to remember that information in a combined test. So the individual skills and getting them in an isolated manner gets you to proficiency. But mastery means that they're able to do it within a minute. And so what this does is it shows you how are my kids doing in course mastery over time. And one of the things that's nice here is as you look at this course mastery, because like I said, we really like 60 skills throughout the year, is you can see the weekly change. So are they still working? And if they continue to work at this page, they can see the weekly change. They're still working. And if they continue to work at this pace, where are they going to be? Or how many, what percentage of my kids are actually going to meet the mastery? Now, one last thing. And for a lot of the data, most of the data into CSV files. So this is just something to keep in mind if you have people who love CSV files and pivot tables, you can do some of the same information. But you can download all of your data. The overall gives you all of it. And then the skills, mastery, and conmigo. So the information will match what's on the dashboard, but it's just in a CSV file that maybe you want to upload it into a system. So with that, that was the quick overview of the administrator dashboard. Any questions? Questions, comments? Concerns. Concerns. I just have one quick question. Barbara, can you at the top show again where you switched from your different roles? Sure. It's up here under your name. And my name is not Maxie, but Maxie is my name today. So that's the sandbox. And I'm going to go ahead and click there, and that shows you that. Thank you. Yep. Because that was the one thing, you know, when I was assigned to sandbox, when I went in, I'm like, wait, this is not the right because it defaulted to teacher. And so, and I'm like, where's the dashboard? And I couldn't find it anywhere. So that's just one thing to really keep in mind when you're looking for something and you're thinking, I should definitely have that. That was an easy question. Any other questions for Barbara? We're going to switch a little bit and now I'm going to talk more how to use the data. She's giving you a good overview on where the data lives. We're trying to stop sharing the screen. Oh, I got it. Okay. I'll take it over. Thank you. Yep. And let me just share this. And let me switch this. Okay. Can everyone see my screen now? Actually, I'm going to move your faces and then let's go back to this. Yes, we're going to see my screen. Okay. So thank you so much, Barbara, for doing the overview. So now I want to kind of move towards what does it mean to use this data? Now, part, you're all here because you're learning about Khan Academy, Khanmigo, and it is sponsored by the State Department of Ed for grades 5 through 12. But our goal is to empower you to make sure that you are using all of this data towards mastery, learning, proficiency, and beyond with Khanmigo as the tool. So when we, because we're enrolling all of the districts all at once, we're really excited about. But historically what happens is when you sign up, we have a very robust kickoff call that sets goals. So what's been happening because we're really still signing up many New Hampshire districts. We're going to be doing things more at a statewide level. So when you have, we'll be having kickoff calls, and then we're going to be having professional learning that your educators and leaders can sign up for. But I want you to think through a couple of things since you're here with me today on this summer learning series. I want you to think about how you would utilize this data. What courses, Khan Academy courses, might you be interested in thinking about to enroll your students? Like last week we talked about SATs. We also just found out New Hampshire has some AP civics. Civics, what is it? Requirements. Oh my goodness. That's words coming to my head, right? So there's a lot of courses that students can enroll in. There's a lot of courses your educators can use as supplemental content. But I want to think through, so you have several pieces of data here. It's focused on skills to proficiency and minutes, right? Who thinks, who is first thought, best thoughts? What are some of the ways you might want to utilize some of this data? Does anyone want to take a social and academic risk type in the chat, come off mute? Like she just did a huge overview. What are you thinking right now about how to use this in your planning? How to use this with teachers? Thank you. Thanks, Kate. So we're focusing starting with our math department. And so they actually met yesterday. They're identifying specific courses. They want to start with, but then our big push will be with the SAT course. Thank you. And since, since, since you volunteered Katie, let's just give me one more second of your time. So how will these data reports help your educators know what students are doing or how might you think about utilizing these? So I think when it comes to, sorry, when it comes to the, the SAT prep, we're hoping to be a little bit more proactive and begin that preparation early in the year. And after listening to last, last week's session, my team is actually looking at the progression that you shared in terms of using the courses from ninth on. So I think for them aligning the courses as they're teaching is going to just influence what they're doing in their classroom. But then once we're getting to the digital SAT prep, we can be a little bit more specific within our advisories to make sure that we have students getting that targeted support that they need. So I don't know if that really answered your question. It's perfect. Yes. Yes. So where I want to start to draw the dots for you in the last for the last like half second half of this, there's a lot of conversations about what does it mean to be data informed instruction? And I feel like many of you have lots of data points in your buildings. Like some of you are using map growth. Some of you are using I ready as a universal screener. And what are the purpose of those to know how all of your students are doing across a spectrum of standards at the beginning of the year and what students might need to progress? Right. That's why you would use a universal screener. So we don't have universal screeners with Khan Academy and Khan Meego, but it does. Our courses do fit with core content. If you're using map growth, that's why we have learning paths, which which plugs in Khan Academy content based on students, RIT scores. If you're using like an I ready or Renaissance star, we don't necessarily plug into those universal screeners, but we can, you can use Khan Academy to fill in some of those academic gaps that you might uncover based on data. So that's more like three times a year, big picture. But when we're thinking about going through like a course like the SAT, thank you, Katie. So we'll focus in on SAT. I want to show you what does it mean to actually use Khan Meego and your educators to use Khan Meego to have those data informed weekly push. Because a lot of times you'll look at this and sometimes like, great, there are, they were on 86 minutes. Is that good? Is that bad? I have no idea. Right. Or Barbara kept talking about 60 skills. So we have done research, but Khan Meego still pretty new. But in our research, we're finding that if students can be on at least 30 minutes a week and at the end of the year, if they're getting 60 skills, which means we want to have some metrics of what does success look like. So that's why this dashboard is broken up by time and skills. Cause that's what our research is showing. And, and that's what we'll encourage you as leaders to look at. And then I want to focus now on what do your educators, what could they use in order to see our kids experiencing success in like an SAT course, algebra one course. And then, so we'll talk about that. Then the second thing, how do we use this data? If your educators are just using Khan Meego for the writing coach, or if Khan Meego, if students are just using Khan Meego to tutor them on different, if they're using it in science or social studies, like outside of Khan Academy content. So we'll talk about what does it look like for educators to have data and form planning using like an SAT course and then not using it. Does that work? Was that clear as mud? Okay, cool. So I want to start with thinking through the SAT course. So I showed this before, but now we're zooming in on a real instance. So I am teaching, I'm using the SAT course with my students and teacher tools. We do have something called the class snapshot. I showed this to you before, but now we're going to zoom this in. So if I have my knee, my students are in this, they're enrolled in this SAT prep course. I can come to this. Let's say it's Sunday and I'm thinking through the, my week of instruction and I'm like, I really want to plan some small group, maybe rotational activities, or maybe I want to have a fun Friday where I have students use some kind of Academy content, but I also want to do something more creative and innovative on that Friday, but still having to do with SAT skills. You following me still? Okay. So I can click this. What this class snapshot is going to do, it's using Conmeigo to analyze. So as leaders, you don't have this yet, but I mean, you do have this, you can have access to this and see what any of your educators are doing in their courses because this is giving real time data. This updates every seven days. The dashboard is going to be updating daily. Obviously you're going to see minutes. You're going to see all of that. Like it's a dynamic dashboard. But if I want to focus more and see this is my students, this is my students. This is the SAT course. It's going to give me some suggestions like who needs a check in with skills. This is where we can actually start thinking through data conversations. That's a piece that we haven't gotten to yet, but it's really important. Any technology you use, any time students are taking any assessment or even the universal screeners that you use, it's so important to let students know where they are, where they want to go and how they're going to get there. So you could use this to celebrate students that are doing a great job that week. You could, this report also, who needs to check in? Who do I have to have a quick data conversation with because I know they're struggling in a certain skill. Maybe I want to know students who are going above and beyond with their goals, or maybe I want to know how do I group my students? Because it would be really great to, for me thinking I'm going to plan like this really great Friday center rotation. So now what this is doing is it's going to, this is demo data. So pretend these students have names. What it's doing is it's grouping my students based on last week's data, real time, last week's data, it's grouping my students. And then it's going to tell me the skill that I need to do with these groups of students. And this group, this group gets this group. So the SAT didn't work cause it's a demo council. Let me show you, this will actually link to a skill. So let's pretend this is SAT, but we're going to talk about algebra one. Now I'm going to do a class snapshot with algebra one. How many of your educators have data conversations with students while this is loading? Is this a, is this a consistent habit that you all have? Kind of. Yeah. So I'm just going to globally say I've worked in the ed tech space for 15 years. The biggest differentiator, the biggest differentiator, no matter what you use, any tool you use, if students, students in the know are students who grow. Hashtag Khan Academy. Okay. Just that is a really good best practice in the summer. As you're thinking about setting up students for success, having educators carve out just a tiny bit of time to talk to students about what they're doing, even if it's this, what they're doing in, you know, just math in general, if you're using any universal screeners, like that, students need to understand where they are. They can ask Khan Meego themselves where they are. I'm going to show that next, but this is for educators thinking, okay, I want to group my class, but not only do I want to group my students, I want to actually make this more fun. I want this more engaging. So what I could do is I know this group right here, they need to have evaluating expression with multiple value variables. That's, that's something that they could use a little refresher on. So I go here. Now this is called real data driven data informed planning. Now I could assign this to my students saying, this is what I want you to work on. So when we're, I'm planning for small groups, I'm going to pull a group of students work on this skill. You're going to work on Khan Academy. I'm using Khan Meego in this small group or look what I'm going to do right here. And this is part of using the teacher tools. So I'm in the Khan Meego teacher tools. I know this is the skill that students need. So what I'm going to do is ask this, can you give me hands on group activities using manipulatives based on the Olympics? Did someone come off me to ask a question or did somebody just breathe? Okay. Okay. Great. So now what this is doing is I'm going back into the AI and I'm using this to give me ideas of how I can maybe plan some more interactivity in my classroom using this skill. So if I'm thinking about an SAT course, not only are my students going to be on Khan Academy content, I can also use Khan Meego to make it more interesting, interactive in my teaching live with students. Did you see what I just did? Does everyone understand what this means? Questions, comments? Because when we think about data informed planning, I want to make sure that I'm showing you how this can come alive and not just all live on the computer. We're using this to really help. Like for instance, a third activity, Olympic relay race, relay race cards with expressions, whiteboards, students would actually race each other solving equations, which is kind of cool because that's like an interactive thing that we could do on a Friday or event budgeting. So they have to say, how much does it cost set of students and say, you're about to build this Olympic stadium. How much would it cost to do that? Let's figure that out using expressions with multiple barriers, variables, decimals, and fractions. That's just another way to make something come alive. Like students are seeing these, if they're watching the Olympics, if anyone's watching the Olympics, you all watching the Olympics, you're like, I can't stop. Right. And you're seeing like these giant stadiums and the tracks and, and all the stuff they've built. It's like, wow, how did they do that? So that's making the math come alive. So questions about this, this is just one ounce of things that we're going to continue to support you. So we want to make sure that you as leaders are enrolling your classes. If you want to, into courses, then you can use these tools based on the data that's coming that they're doing with Khan Academy to use this to make it more, come alive for students. And then they can get back in and we want to track to see if they're growing. This all makes sense. All right. Then I want to show the last thing. How do we do data informed planning for students using the learner activities? So as students, students are going through, they're taking their SAT courses. They can use Khan Migo, the Socratic tutor to help them with any problem in the moment. Let me just re-show that just because some of you missed the first one. So if I'm taking my SAT course, Sarah did show this, but like maybe foundations in advanced math and just FYI, if your students took like an algebra one course and an SAT course and then they mastered a skill, they don't have to keep doing the same skill. It will transfer. So if they knew structured in expressions and they mastered this, then it's not going to make them take it again. Just FYI. So again, this is how the Socratic tutor works. If this is the activity I'm working on, factoring quadratic polynomial expressions and foundations. If I am struggling with this, this is where Khan Migo can help on the side, help me solve this, try a similar example. Like this is where the Socratic tutor comes in. And then as educators, you can use Khan Migo to say, what are my students doing? So like if I'm, I'm working through this, I'm talking to Khan Migo and like help me finish it. And teachers are like, that's great. So I want to know, hey, can you tell me for the last week, what have my students been doing and talking with Khan Migo? So not only can you use Khan Migo and it's computer, you can use the AI to do data informed planning with what they're doing on Khan Academy. Now you can use AI to see what students are talking to the AI about and then use that for your planning. Did you catch that? Or is that like multi-level of a matrix or something? Right? So maybe I want to know it's not going to really work because it's a, this is like Barbara said Maxine doesn't have a ton of data. So I can say, tell me the topics my students are talking about. Now we save the chats either you can choose as a district, this is part of our onboarding. You can keep them for 60 days and they'll go away. Or now you can keep them from refer the full academic year. We don't share these chats with anybody else. So this is for you in your district. This is part of our data privacy, but say I want last for the past week. So I want to actually see what my students were talking about for the past week. And again, this may or may not work because it's demo data. So between July 30th, oh, somebody was in there. Great. Obviously kids aren't in here, but it's saying now for the last week, here are the topics that students were discussing. How to solve equations, area, circle, photosynthesis. Okay. Great. Wow. Actually, I'm curious. Who's talking about photosynthesis because I assigned that for one. Right? Like that might be like what students are what. So the student had talked about solving equation. They discussed this topic. Were there any concerns? So educators can now use con amigo to mine. What's happening. If there's flag conversations, if students are confused. Yes. Michael. Does, does it actually capture all of their typing or just the topical. Pieces that there were the students are asking. And then they can go through and see their transcript. It'll save their entire transcript. Okay. Let me go. So as students are chatting, like, if they're like, this is dumb. I want this like it'll save everything. And you can go through and see their transcripts too. Great. Thanks. Yeah, of course. And that's where, even here. You can see the students with any flagged issues. We talked about that earlier with moderation. So. There's a place that you can see all the transcripts. I think you can export them too. So that's another way that you are utilizing. Commigo as real time data informed planning. And then the final piece, any other questions about this? Looking at the chat. Okay. And just, I know there's confusion originally when we talked about the partnership with New Hampshire. This is included only in the partnership because it's mining the data for the student facing tutor. And then the other thing I just showed you going back in and pushing inside Khan Academy content to make things more interesting. That's part of the partnership. So educators can't get this if they're just signing up for the free tools. Oh, and this is exciting too. We just migrated this. So your educators are now going to have access to chat GPT for Omni, not just the chat GPT for. So that's part of the partnership. Every one of your educators has access to that. And the final thing I'm going to talk about is how our students doing data informed planning. If they're thinking about it's our goal with this and any really learning solution in my opinion is how are we empowering students to own their learning? That's why I mentioned data conversations with an adult. Sometimes it's also hard for adults to get around to everybody to talk about their data. So we could actually utilize Khan Migo to help. Talk about their data. What? Right. So in here, again, let me show you where this lives. Learner activities. So when students log in, They will have access to their courses. So for instance, Katie's district is assigning SAT. So when I log in, if I'm in her district, I'll see the SAT courses or I'll see algebra one courses, but I can also see my, um, My learner activities and I can see my own chat history. Right. So I students can actually see their own. So they can go in and, and see their own. Chat history. They can also customize Khan Migo a little bit because again, we want them to empower students. So maybe I have a simple reading style. I, you can say which language you want them to respond. And again, come, you go only speaks right now, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. And then I want to, uh, I can customize the voice if I want to have the audio read to me. Then I can also add some things I'm interested in because I want Khan Migo to be personalized to me. It'll start to learn that the more that I, as students type into it, but students can also personalize it or they can turn this off. If we don't want, if I want to delete all my interests because I'm an eighth grader and change my interests every 30 days. Anybody feel that right? So this is a way for students to start to empower. And again, we will share all of this with you and all your educators. I'm just giving you a high level overview of how this is data informed planning. So I can go into Khan Migo as a student and I can go to what should I learn next and ask Khan Migo, you know what? What should I learn next? What should I be focusing on? Well, it's doing a data conversation with me saying, great. You know what? You scored below a 75 on a couple of these assignments. Maybe you want to improve your score or if you were struggling, here's something else that you can learn. I worked for an ed tech company for eight years and the biggest differentiator was getting educators to talk to students about data. Khan Migo is talking to students about data. If they click here. How. I mean, y'all, when I said, do your teachers have data chats, you were like. Hey. So having students know what they're working on, what they need to do next and where they need to go to grow is very empowering. Thoughts about this questions, comments. It's pretty great, right? Yeah. So. The point of today was to show you. The best thing about data is that you use it. Like we could have the prettiest dashboard. It could be the most easy to use, but if you don't use it to relate to the human experience, then. What's, what's the point, right? So I just want to reiterate over here. There are wonderful resources. I opened this up. We have a help area. So if you have any questions, even as you're going through, even after we gave you your accounts, all of that, and then we're going to, we're going to be giving you additional resources as part of our PL, but you can have access to this right now. We have an administrator guide. If you want to know more of how all of this works together, how do you get started? And if you want to have a deeper dive into just the data dashboard, we have resources for you. But the whole point, I know you have, I mean, I value your time that you're spending time with me right now in the summer to learn. We know in school year, get started. You have about this much time, maybe you're lucky, right? So we're trying as a company to make things easier for you to see as leaders when you want, when you log in, but we want to make this actionable and impactful for students and teachers. So in conclusion, you have a data dashboard. You'll get more training on that, but data informed planning, that's where Conmigo is really saving some time from the class snapshot, where you can see your educators can see Khan Academy content, how students are doing, and then use Conmigo to make those lessons a little bit more interesting. You can use the, it's called, excuse me, summarizing student chat history, where you can now see what students are doing with their Conmigo Socratic tutor, and then ways for students themselves to use Conmigo to empower their own learning and data. So from district to teacher to student. Questions about this before I just close out with reminders. Questions, comments? Great. So the district partnership, all of this, that's why we're so excited. It's the only way to get Conmigo that student facing tutor. So if you have not signed up yet, and one more time, show you where you can go. So here's the process. It doesn't matter. We'd like for you to have signed up, but you didn't before July 31st, which is okay. Many people have. So you can come here. I'm in a second. I'll put that link in the chat, but here's the process. Once you sign up. You will get a contract. We are working. You'll have it through Adobe sign or docu sign. I forgot which one you sign that, send it back to us. That process has taken a couple of days. Then once your contract is signed, Barbara will send you an email. There's a survey we're asking y'all to fill out to give us some focus. Like Katie said, SAT is really important for her district. So is there an algebra one or an SAT focus? Like some, a little bit more on thinking about the learning. Then what we're doing is we're going to be releasing really soon to everybody. Our professional learning signups. We're going to be have a, the last couple of weeks of August into September options for different topics on teacher, professional learning, like how to get started with accounts, all of that leader, professional learning, and then we'll have office hours. So we're going to be rolling with a lot of support September, October, November, virtually. And then again, um, I'm happy to help with any questions that you have, but the first goal sign up, we're going to get your teachers in. And then we'll start, uh, we're rounding the corner to do a little bit more support. And again, I'll send the, all of the videos for the last, this was the fourth one. Yeah, no, this is the fifth one, that's one. So I'll send all five recordings out to everyone who registered next week, all about learning coach the last week, only if you use map growth, map growth, do you need to attend? Um, cause we're talking about the learning path piece. Cause a lot of districts use map growth and a lot of districts don't questions, comments, but anything else? Um, okay. Oh great. Christine, I'll show you where the administrator guide is and Karen, I'm going to be emailing out. I think we were trying to put the webinars on our landing page. So let me, um, I'm going to send an email today or tomorrow with all of the recordings for everyone who's registered. So since you were on this one, you'll get all the old other recordings, but we were trying to put it on the landing page. I'll check. That's another, I'll make a note of that. And then where do you find that admin guide? So if you, um, you probably aren't in your accounts yet. So two things, if you want to trial account, let me put my email in the chat. I'm happy to give you a trial account. And if I'll also send the admin guide, how about that? As part of the follow-up. Cause you can get it once you're in, let me just, I can't do two things. Once con academy. So I will send the videos as a follow-up, all the recordings we've done so far, and I'll send some admin resources. Um, but when you're in your account, you get it right here. You click on it right here. So actually I think the admin guide might come up with a link. I wonder if this, I wonder if it's universal. Let's see. I'm gonna put it in the chat. Maybe you can click on it. Maybe you can't. We make everything pretty free. So we'll see. So I'm curious if you can check it, click on that. You can. Great. Success. I sent you the admin guide. So that's one, one success. And then, um, I let me, I'm going to stop this recording just so people don't have to hear me. Look around. I was like, Oh, I'm going to stop this recording. I'm going to stop this recording. And then you can hear me. Look around.
