Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy, and I just wanted to let you know about our India talent search. As you might know, Khan Academy were a not-for-profit with a mission of providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. And to us, that means that if you are a villager someplace and you don't have access to a formal school, then you might be able to access a low-cost smartphone and then be able to self-educate yourself and one day prove what you know so that you could get a job or go into higher education. But ideally, you're using Khan Academy in conjunction with a classroom. Where the classroom can allow students to learn and work at their own pace, give data to teachers, free up class time for more open-ended projects or peer-to-peer learning or Socratic dialogue. And so we have a call-out for the talent, the teaching talent in India, to work with us. By being part of this talent search, one, you'll get a chance to practice making videos yourself, and we're looking for folks in math and science and initially, but eventually all subjects. But it's a way for us to find talent, talent that can help us create content that will educate tens of millions of learners throughout India. So the opportunity here is, I think, pretty exciting. There will be prizes, but maybe the biggest prize of all is the opportunity to contribute and to help your fellow citizens. If you want to participate, participate by December 12th. And now I'm going to hand it off to Anand, who is our head of content in India. I had a great math teacher when I grew up, and I used to keep wondering, what would it be like if way more students could learn from someone like him? And it also got me thinking, how many other such great teachers exist whom I'm not able to learn from? Just because they're not able to reach me. So I know that as a teacher, what's the biggest dream? It's to be able to reach as many learners as possible. And in India, it could be like tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of learners who could learn directly from us. So it's been a dream to conduct like a talent search which would bring together these great content creators and create content for math and science and maybe many more subjects. So this year, we're finally able to do it. And in this talent search, we're looking for math and science to begin with for standards 6 to 12. And in English and Hindi, again, to begin with. And who knows, next year, we might do a much larger project than this. So send your entries. And here's Grant, who won last year's US talent search and who's currently a fellow. To say a few words. Hey, everyone. My name is Grant Sanderson. I had the good fortune of last year being one of the United States talent search winners. And after that, there was kind of a whirlwind of experiences. I ended up being a content fellow here. I've been working on multivariable Cal content and a little bit in other math areas. And probably this goes without saying. But one of the biggest benefits of being here is the reach. And I mean the global reach, knowing that the stuff that you're going to make actually influences a lot of students' lives out there. For example, in India, I'm really excited that they're doing an India talent search for India specific content because this means people can create math content or whatever else. Much better than I ever could or much better than anyone here ever could just because it is localized in that sense. So I'm excited to see what you have to make and have fun. One thing to keep in mind when you make your submissions is we care a lot more about the content and the substance of your video than the production value. You should also let everyone you know know about this talent search. I'm sure you might know some really good teachers out there. And try to get your submissions in by December 12th.
