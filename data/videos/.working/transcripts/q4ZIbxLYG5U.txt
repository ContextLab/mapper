Hi everyone, my name is Danielle Sullivan. My role at Khan Academy is I'm the senior manager of Northeast District Partnerships and my educator former role is I used to be a fifth and sixth grade special education teacher. I taught ELA and math in Washington DC and upstate New York and I will let Sarah go ahead and introduce herself. Hey everyone, welcome. I am Sarah Robertson. I'm currently the senior product product manager of literacy and classroom experience teams here at Khan Academy. Just like Danielle, I'm a former classroom teacher. I taught middle school ELA and brief stint as a history teacher but mostly reading and writing and I also am coming from another literacy focused ed tech company. I think Danielle also joined us from another one as well and I will pass it off to let's do Deanna. Hello everyone, I am Deanna Clingman. I am a professional learning specialist with Khan Academy. Just like my colleagues that are on the on the panel with me, I am a former classroom teacher. Elementary is where my heart is. I have taught second grade, third grade and fifth grade. I've done behavior intervention. I've been a building principal as well as director of academics. So been in all levels. Definitely understand and love connecting with other educators and with that I am going to pass it over to Bernadette. Hi, I am Bernadette Bennett. I am a professional learning content specialist with Khan Academy. I am a former middle school teacher and district social study supervisor from Florida and I'm so excited to be with you guys today. Right, so here's how this is going to work. We, I'm going to stop sharing my screen because the focus is going to be on the conversation. So we will be having some really rich interesting conversation around transformative role of AI and improving literacy scores because as you know, I'm sure you're feeling this, a lot of students have felt left behind after COVID especially in literacy. I mean, I would say math too, but today we're focusing on literacy. So we want to delve into and just have a like a really in-depth conversation around how you all can start to think about AI's adaptive learning, personalized feedback to help students improve their reading and writing skills and actually just let's talk about a little joy too, right? Love, love literacy. So we're just, we'll be talking, please post comments in the chat and questions in the chat. I'll be able to see those and we are going to kick it off with this question. So, Sarah Khan Academy isn't often thought of, Khan Academy isn't often thought of as like a go-to tool for literacy instruction and support, but here we are, we are doing a literacy and ELA webinar. So what has changed? Yeah, so I actually joined Khan Academy about a year and a half ago, which was right around the time that Khan Academy had partnered with OpenAI around how we might use large language models in order to create really rich learning experiences. And so on my first day at Khan Academy, my manager sat me down and said, by the way, we have this partnership with OpenAI. Have you heard of chat TPT? And I had just come from another literacy supplemental ed tech tool product and was, you know, had literacy on the mind was very excited to come to Khan Academy knowing that there were opportunities to build new tools and content for literacy. So this was, it felt like a sign that like I had come at exactly the right time, because what we were seeing with many of our different explorations we were doing with chat TPT and the large language models that they were, that we were experimenting with was that some of the best experiences that LLMs could support were related to reading instruction and writing instruction. And so we dove headfirst into the different ways that we could leverage AI to create really innovative, rich learning experiences for students when it came to reading and writing. The very, you know, first month I was here, we did a hackathon. And one of the features that came out of that was our current essay feedback activity, which I'll talk a little bit more about later on. But I'll also just say that the more that we at Khan Academy have partnered with districts over the past few years, the clearer it is to us that the demand for high quality and flexible resources for ELA is higher than it's ever been. I think again, just coming out of, you know, the pandemic and coming into this age of AI, reading and writing classes have been disrupted. And we need to be thinking of like, really creative innovative ways to be reaching students now in a way that's maybe a little bit different than, you know, when I was actually in the classroom and definitely when I was a student myself. So we're really excited about some of that, those new activities we're building. We also are launching brand new ELA courses for middle school and high school starting. I think we just launched the sixth grade one already. And we'll be launching I think ninth and tenth grade as well for this back to school season. So it's definitely a new age, a new era of Khan Academy. And we're really excited about the new reading and writing resources that we're building. Yes. And how many of you who are watching this sometimes have struggled with supporting your students in writing? Anybody anybody feel that pain? That would be me. Yes, thanks. Exactly. So the goal is how can we engage our students to be more thoughtful in the way they express themselves? So I want to think through it's been a rough couple of years. Can you believe it's 24, by the way, 2024. We're just thinking about students that are graduating this year. They started in 2020. So, oh, there's a lot that's happened in the last four years. So thinking of the last four years, Deanna, how can AI be leveraged to address some of the gaps that we're seeing exasperated by the pandemic or learning opportunities if we want to spin it the positive way? Yeah, absolutely. I am not only an educator, but I'm a parent. So my daughter is a senior this year. And so some of that personal impact of the pandemic, not only, you know, has affected me not as a teacher, as an educator, but also as a parent as well. My mind, when I think about AI and how we could use it to help leverage some help with some of those gaps, is my mind goes to that targeted instruction. You know, the bigger the gaps, the more of that targeted instruction that you want to give to your students. Right. But I also know that, you know, it's easy to say targeted instruction or small group plans. What do you want to do with your small groups? But in reality, that's a whole other set of planning, right? So I'm thinking of that small group planning. And so when I think about AI, I think about some of these tools that we have, such as the ability to just use Commigo to, one, just add to help group your students, you know, it's helping you with grouping your students. It's even being an assistant to you to even, you can just ask it, what do my students need to work on? So cutting that time out with that small group planning, just by having that in the moment support as a teacher to know how do I group my students and what are those things that, you know, they should be working on. I also think about the social emotional approach, right? Thinking about that whole child and addressing those needs. And we know that one of the things is are students even safe with a safe feeling as though I don't know. Right? I don't know what's going on. And so students having that ability to discuss and ask those questions with Commigo, just to even when you're thinking about text analysis, right? Help me understand. I have a question about this text that maybe they don't want to ask out loud in front of their peers. And so just leveraging it in that way, I think is just one of many. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, all of what you said, the small group instruction. Again, how many of you watching have ever struggled with small group instruction? I see you middle school educators. I see you high school educators, right? We know that this is really important practice. So Sarah, can you talk to us about your point of view or some things you're thinking about with post COVID years? Yeah, so I mean, I taught in a classroom where students ranged. I taught in a seventh grade classroom for most of my time in teaching. And I had students who were on a second grade reading level to 12th grade reading level all the way in between. Just a very wide span of skill levels. And a lot of my students struggled with fluency and comprehension or mixture of both there were all kinds of different needs across the entire room. And I know that one of the best things that we can do for students who have gaps in reading comprehension skills specifically, which I would say for my seventh graders was the biggest challenge, was really making sure, A, that they had access to grade level text. Way too many students do not even get the opportunity to try and access and read a grade level text. But knowing that so many students are below grade level, how can we scaffold instruction and how can we create opportunities for students to be able to fill in what's missing in between. And some of the best strategies for doing that are related to pre-teaching and pre-reading prep, which means it looks like activating prior knowledge, making connections to what the text is about, building background knowledge for any of the schema that the student needs to have when it comes to what the text is about, whether it's fiction or non-fiction, pre-teaching tier two and tier three vocabulary and giving students opportunities to practice and get to know words they may be unfamiliar with. And then of course supporting them when it comes to breaking down complex sentences. And one of the really cool things about having an AI presence around to help students with this and help teachers with this is that many of these things are now extremely easy and quick to do with AI. So when you think about you know activating prior knowledge or making connections, all you need to do is go to Connego or an AI tool and have it look at the text and identify you know questions and different engagement tactics for getting students to think about what this text means to them or if they have any kinds of connections to the theme or the characters in the text. Identifying what background knowledge is necessary to be able to understand what the text is about and pre-teaching that, having Connego summarize that for students or ask the students questions about what they already know or what they want to know. Identifying and having Connego even identify from a text what vocabulary words a student likely needs to know in order to be able to comprehend something. And then using some of our pre-built learner activities like Word Safari and Word Architect to practice some of those different words before they even get to the reading piece. And then when the student is actually reading a grade level text, having Connego there on Conne Academy to support them if they run into something that's really complicated or hard for them to parse, it is a you know a judgment-free, not person, but AI to support yeah to go to when they are stuck and when they really don't know you know even why they don't understand something they can go there to ask questions. Another really helpful activity that I would recommend for students who are below grade level is we have this teacher tool with Connego called the text re-leveler. And obviously like I said before it's super important that students don't just get you know texts that are far below grade level for an entire school year. It's really important that they do have opportunities to access grade level text. So one of the best ways to use the text re-leveler is to re-level a text that's at grade level for students. We level it down you know a couple of levels and then have Connego take that re-leveled text and re-level it back up again to where it was before. And then have students look at all three versions. Have them look at the easier version that the AI re-leveled down and that will help them kind of get a baseline understanding of like what the text was about. Have them look at the re-leveled up version and then have them compare that to the original text and look at what did we lose you know when the AI took this text and re-leveled it. What changed? What aspects of author's craft or you know different linguistic elements changed and how did that affect the text meaning? So there are many kind of different and creative ways that you can use AI not only to just you know get students accessing grade level materials more easily but also to create kind of fun and engaging learning experiences. I mean you said so much there are a lot of really amazing gems but I want to hear Bernadette's spin because Bernadette you have a little bit of a different perspective and a background in social studies and some of what Sarah was sharing is from vocabulary and seeing authentic texts and making sure that students have the ability to access regret text. So I'd love to add some coloring context from your point of view on how you see that we can help close these gaps. So when I think about social studies teachers who are also working a lot with vocabulary and with reading and primary source documents so many times when students are looking at primary source documents you know they're looking at some archaic vocabulary they're looking at sometimes a cursive document so you can use AI to focus in on those primary and secondary source documents. You can have AI modify it but still have that original document right there next to it so that a student will see that original document what it looks like at a different grade level but always be able to go back and reach into that original document reach into that original vocabulary and help students understand you know the nuances that were put into that original document as Sarah said that might just be missed when we have a document that is not that's not been modified but the whole key when we're looking at disciplinary literary and social studies literacy is ensuring that students are looking at that original document so being able to take that original document and have them be able to access and understand those concepts is really important as you pull it all together. Thank you so there's some chatter in the chat around what the heck we're talking about. I'm going to give you a resource at the end or QR code to find out more but there are links in the chat we are talking about first and foremost we want to just have a great rich conversation about literacy and post pandemic and how we can leverage AI tools but we do have some really great AI tools as part of Khan Academy that you can absolutely find out more when you find the link in the chat but I want us to really dig into more reading and writing because as somebody said preach in the chat struggling to get students to really engage with meaningful writing I mean I my students as a former special ed teacher they had a fear of putting anything on the page and anyone relate just getting started not having idea generation and it was really difficult because I was full inclusion so I was trying to support so many students in a sixth grade LA classroom and help my students as Deanna was talking about feeling safe feeling validated so how could personalized feedback enhance students reading and writing abilities Deanna let's kick off with you and then we'll yeah absolutely again I think about that safe space right just feeling okay with you know being able to speak in front of everyone or being able to know am I writing or am I writing the correct sentence or just getting them comfortable so I like the fact that we have for example like the tutor me to tutor me uh tool with is tutoring in humanities and so students have the opportunity to either get quizzed um on certain skills and again it's that safe space I just I keep going to that because I know a lot of my students came to me with not a lot of prior knowledge we talked about that before and so when it came time for those class discussions what did some of them do behave their way out right or they might just shut down because they don't want to they don't they don't have anything to contribute to the conversation so having tools such as like tutor me you know in humanities where you can ask those questions about the text prior to or even during you know as the teacher if I had it in my classroom I would definitely model for them and create opportunity for them create opportunities for them to you know answer specific questions go you know reach out to kamigo ask kamigo you know why this is happening and then that'll give them that context the other cool thing about it as well is for those students that may have those kind of issues with reading that you know reading fluently may be an issue kamigo can speak to them so they can have their headphones in and it almost feels like an actual conversation because what happens is even if you know if typing is not my strong suit like you were talking about for some of your special education students you know you can speak and speak and speak into kamigo and say you know hey why is this happening kamigo is going to generate it and then it has the ability now to talk back to you so if typing and reading is not a student's strong point they're able to now feel more empowered because now it's almost like having a conversation like you and I are having in this moment to help them you know get stronger in those skills absolutely so sarah what are your thoughts on this yeah so I mentioned earlier one of the first things that we started exploring when we when we were dipping our toes into the ai pool was essay feedback so I I taught both reading and writing at the school where I taught they were separate classes and writing was a lot harder I think the teaching reading for the main reason that the feedback piece is just such a challenge if you have more than you know 20 students in a class which I think most teachers do um and so the way that we designed the kamigo academic essay feedback activity was a way for students to get instant high quality feedback that was actionable and organized by you know specific feedback area without having to wait for you know days or even weeks to get any kind of information back from their teachers um and so the way that it works is that a student submits their essay draft as well as information about the essay as it was assigned by their teacher anything related to the essay's genre or the grade level that they're in and then we put the essay through all of these very very meticulously configured ai prompts that generate feedback in five different areas and then students can kind of navigate between those five different areas if they click on a piece of feedback it will highlight what part of the essay it's talking about the student can then also chat with kamigo about that piece of feedback and say I don't understand what you mean can you explain this or can you give me an example of you know you're telling me my thesis isn't very strong can you give me an example of what a strong thesis looks like and it will do that without actually giving them any of the the writing for the essay itself so it's programmed in order to prevent students from using ai to cheat and the best part too is that students can then update and revise their essay and ask kamigo hey what does it look like now like what do you think now and kamigo can look at the feedback that the teach the students referencing and the edit they just made and say yes like you know what you just did you check the box like that looks great or it can say you know I think you still need a little bit of work here and it's this safe space for students to get follow-up support they can ask for more help and as a teacher again I just remember like being in a classroom where you know sometimes I would have like a sea of hands in the air where kids were just like I'm stuck or they had you know it was maybe a student who was just like can you read the sentence and every time they wrote a sentence they'd be like can you read the sentence and then there were other students who just had their heads down or the ones who usually needed the help the most didn't have their hands up at all and the best part about this is that it empowers the students to do to ask kamigo for help when they need it but it also allows kamigo to do some of those checks for students even if they are not asking for it so one of the things we're working on now is called writing coach which builds upon the essay feedback activity and it actually walks students through the entire essay process so that one in particular really targets those kids who are just feeling really stuck feeling really disengaged like feeling like they don't know where to begin and we're too excited too about the implications that writing coach will have on our ability to report back so much more about student writing to teachers right now you know teachers often see the final draft maybe a first draft if they if they can manage it but with this kind of ai activity we can synthesize a lot of these interactions and report them back to the teacher including things like hey you know this student just pasted 500 words it's not from their outline that i helps them work on um maybe you should you know click on this and drill down and see see what happens so lots of really exciting new kamigo features coming for writing this fall uh lots of new exciting things can we just pause and just let this marinate for a second how many of you watching teach writing about y'all do because we're teachers and any ela class any literacy if we think about reading is breathing in writing is exhaling getting students to be able to explain their thoughts and to have a tool that does that really supports students i mean bernadette how many times did you have to read essays on all the things and what happens if students don't cite it correctly or if they try to make up facts how do you think ai can help with that so there are a couple of things that that we can do first of all before we even get to that sighting kids have to be able to know you know where do we start and so sometimes using tools like chatting with a historical figure or chatting with the literary figure are great ways to get kids to start thinking about topics so they can chat with a literary figure or historical figure ask them about claims and evidence what what do they think and they can go and develop those arguments the other thing that conmigo does is it does debates it does debates at the elementary the middle and the high school level on specific topics so if a student is having trouble trying to figure out a claim or evidence or an argument starting with one of these and giving them that practice with conmigo to develop those themes is a great way to get them started in that writing process i think so many of my middle school students and you know teachers that i worked with at the high school level were always how do we get my kids started and this is a great way to get your kids started and again there's lots of ways to look at that when we come back around and start looking at you know how do we make sure that they're citing correctly how do we make sure we're doing that conmigo can help with that as well and that's also a good check it's important for students to understand what it is to cite what is plagiarism how do you cite ai how do you cite that you used an ai tool in your paper and that's an important piece that so many times well you know if i co-wrote it well you know and it's like having a co-author you have to write it together and you have to be able to explain that to your teacher so being able to use these tools at all areas of the writing piece and again being able to zoom in on things like claims and evidence or being able to zoom in on argumentation depending upon what kind of writing they're doing and what kind of testing they're taking because when we start now looking even at some of our ap and ib and ace exams they have to be able to do that as well and this is great practice for all levels yeah and this conversation is making me want to go back and teach essays which i wasn't very successful at let's be honest well so a couple people are chiming in the chat i'm really excited about the writing coach really excited yes we are going to send the recording to everybody so you get a care package by signing up for the webinar you are welcome and part of that care package not to get that excited it's just a recording and some resources um but speaking of resources speaking of champ i'm segwaying really randomly i'm going to go into challenges opportunities i'm excited about a lot of things i wish i could have had a really long conversation with you know daygatsby you can now through conmigo but i couldn't back then but what are some things you think people will be nervous to implement um diana why don't you kick us off some maybe opportunities or the challenges well i think one of the things like a lot of like with other um ai the cool thing about conmigo is students don't have an opportunity to go to conmigo and say write my essay for me conmigo is a Socratic tutor and so because of that conmigo is going to come back and i think conmigo has like the best personality if that's what you want to call it but it has a little personality because it's going to say yeah but as your ai tutor i can't write your paper but let's think about this topic it always brings the student back so it won't be it won't just do the work for them that process especially in writing writing is a process right so you know no matter what you know students still need to be able to speak to how did i come up with this idea how you know what edits did i make it's one thing if just on one day you know just yesterday you were only writing two sentences now today you can do a whole dissertation like you know it's so you still have to make students students still need to be able to speak to it um so i think this is a great opportunity to still hold students accountable but still have them have an assistant without it just doing the work for them um i think one of the challenges that you know we're finding too is having to coach students on having these conversations back and forth with conmigo you know it's one thing to say i don't understand you know this specific topic you know that we're studying but students are still having a mindset kind of that conmigo is a search engine and it's not it's more so ask it to simplify ask it to clear you know clarify for you what do you mean by this well you know what it you know what does it mean to analyze this text or you know anything having those conversations back and forth that's you know one of one of the the challenges um but you just have to make sure you're coaching your students and modeling for them how to you know have a conversation back and forth with conmigo is not a one and done correct and ai is meant to enhance the human intelligence human experience right because we want to still bring talking back into our classrooms that just that just did a justin timberlake reference for y'all so there are when we think about challenges right i mean thinking about the human experience what are what are some of your thoughts on that yeah i agree with you know everything that bernada and diana have been saying i feel like there's this common misconception that ai equals chatbots and you know it's probably the most commonly known format for interacting with ai right now um that teachers are aware of but i don't think that we should be thinking about integrating ai into literacy classrooms as just finding more ways for students to chat with ai um i actually i mean when i think back to the best moments uh as a teacher in my reading classrooms and my writing classrooms it was the moments where we were talking together and with each other with our peers and groups about books and about um you know big themes important characters and all kinds of like you know just the rich experiences that you have when you are writing and when you are reading something together and one of the things that i i want people to come away with is this understanding that bringing ai into literacy classrooms doesn't mean taking that time away um where we're connecting with each other and we're talking with each other i think it has more to do with enabling teachers with um better tools to generate like really creative learning experiences and materials and helping students with the hard parts of reading and writing that are often experienced independently anyway so that experience of you know reading a a paper that your teacher's marked up you know that doesn't have to be such an isolating experience and we know that every teacher doesn't have time to sit down and do that every time with every kid and then same thing with reading you know oftentimes there's moments where you might get tripped up when you're reading something and we don't want that to you know dismantle this whole classroom experience of being able to discuss a book and what it means and those are the experiences that i think ai can help with a lot and then again just making it a lot more a lot easier for teachers to have access to a creative partner to something that can help them plan projects or class discussions give students an opportunity to like bernadette mentioned chat with the literary character from a book they're reading but then talk about it as a class like just discuss with each other what did we think of that experience like did it feel authentic like what what about the ai seems like it might have you know gone against what the author intended um in the book that they wrote and why like that's a really wonderful jumping off point for an essay they could write so there's so many ways that you can integrate ai into classroom experiences that don't necessarily you know keep students just isolated in front of their screens i think the best use case that we can um all drive toward is ways that we can use ai to actually encourage more learning experiences that are collaborative and and communal because again like that i think is is where all the joy comes out and i think if we are able to get ai to help more students access you know rich and grade level appropriate texts then i think we could see a lot more opportunities to have that kind of class discussion and engagement absolutely and i would love for us to take a minute and really we have been wearing our teacher hats but i want us to put our teacher hats back on and i want you to think about what was maybe something that was really challenging for you when you were teaching you know social studies literacy for me special education that this tool could have helped immediately like solve that pain point bernadette what about you that's something that maybe you were like i wish i had this i wish i had this um so i think there i think there are so many levels to that because the conmigo teacher tools are so varied and so diverse i think that there isn't enough time in a in a webinar to really go over all of those but some of the things that when when i think about it you know as a teacher i always wanted to make sure that my students were accurate and that we were ensuring accuracy and i know when i first you know thought about ai you know it was the wild wild west you know it was this ai coming in and writing everything for my kids and it was none of their own original work and that to me was probably the biggest pain point and fear when i started thinking and looking into ai um what i absolutely love about conmigo and con academy is the fact that that's not the case this is your student's original work when they're working with an essay generator the students have to put in their own thoughts and ideas and develop their own characters conmigo can help them expand that and update their vocabulary and help them look at those juicy sentences and juicy words but those are the places where when we start talking about ensuring that accuracy it's student-generated work it's not i threw in a topic and you know this essay was spit out for me and i think that that's really really important as a teacher and that was always my fear with this um i think the other thing is that whole feedback piece um you know when you've got a class of 20 25 30 or more students how do you give that individual feedback on a regular basis um i would love to say i did that every day with every single student there was no way there was no way but with con academy and with ai and with conmigo a teacher can go in and say okay i want you to put your essays in i want everybody to look at your own introductions and do it and talk through and then even have a class discussion about the feedback that they got from the ai from conmigo regarding that introduction or their conclusion or their claims whatever those pieces are and it's now a student is getting that individual work and even when they're at home maybe they're writing at home or maybe you're working with a small group and the rest of your class is kind of sitting there this is an opportunity for your students to get that one-on-one when you physically cannot do it which unfortunately as teachers ends up happening um and especially if they're taking work home and writing from home you want to make sure that they're not you know just getting an ai to do it because when they do put it in the essay checker ai is going to look at it and go hey you know are you sure where did you get this and that's something that um is important as a teacher for me to know that there's accuracy there and that they're getting feedback and they're getting good feedback and it's on their work yeah last time i checked we still can't clone teachers so this is a really important way to be able to do that feedback um diana what do you think what would be your who there's a right there's uh the rubric generator the fact that i can you know i used to spend so much time going online trying to find rubrics you know that align with you know the writing that we're doing you know for my students and then sometimes you know it was a pdf so i couldn't go in and make any kind of edits to it and so the fact that there's an actual rubric generator you know to help with my help my students with writing is amazing um the other one that comes out to me as well is the fun class summary poem you know when i think about my students and you know you want a way to kind of wrap up that lesson right you might have you know just been talking about main idea my students used to love used to love rap music so poetry and rap you know they kind of go hand in hand and so i think it would have just been so cool to because i i'm not a lyricist i i can't come up with you know quick things like that and then also include in corp maybe even incorporating things that they like you know in this fun class of this the fun class summary poem because the students have to give you feedback of what did we learn today give me some ideas and then it generates and it wraps up the lesson into this nice um summary like poem and i think that you know it it would have just been a fun way to close out that lesson um for me it was also hard you know if your students say hey i like fortnite or i like this game or that game i only knew it because of them but something right now being able to generate and talk about those things without me having to go and interview a kid or take some more time that i don't have away from my planning to research this on my own to me is amazing um so i just really wish i had that rubric generator and like i said the funny class summary poem is is um would have been one of my go-tos that's amazing so we are just rounding out um our time together um that i want i'm just going to have sarah have the last word let's think forward five ten years in the future what are your dreams and hopes for literacy instruction what kind of utopian world could could there be knowing what we know now yeah it's a great question so um i mean my mind is like spinning with all of the different ways that the current tools we have and the current technology we have could have helped me in the classroom in the hours i spent hours and hours and hours doing things that ai can now do in seconds i think one of the challenges though is you know i like i've learned now in my role here at khan academy how to be a fairly decent prompt engineer which means i know how to talk to ai to get it to give me the things that i need um but not all teachers have those skills and one of the benefits of the the khan migo teacher tools which all of you can go and sign up for right now um on the khanmigo.ai link that i think we've put in the chat um but one of the benefits of those tools is that you don't have to be a skilled prompt engineer to do many of these things um but thinking forward to the you know the next five years or so it's hard to predict where we're going but i am imagining even more kind of like custom flexible tools that are designed specifically for ela teachers a lot of our khanmigo tools now can be used by any subject but um i'm really excited about some of the things that we are we have in the works for reading instruction and reading comprehension where teachers don't have to you know do much of that front work to prep i just remember it took so long for me to find a text that i wanted to use and then prepare that text for my students in order for them to access it with the scaffolding and the questions and all the different ways we would discuss it so um i don't even think that's five years i think that's like six months from now on khan academy um but just like freeing up so much more teacher time and when i think about it from a student perspective just calling back to what i was talking about earlier with these just like rich classroom experiences where students are not focused on what's happening on a screen necessarily and maybe the technology is there to provide support where they need it or to you know be a partner when they need one um to motivate students i think there's some cool things that we're dreaming up right now when it comes to you know student engagement and gamification and student motivation that we can use ai for um but yeah i think the future is just let's bring students together more and let's bring um teachers let's make teachers more of you know a facilitator of of learning versus just these task pastors that are just having to do so many things all at the same time usually um so i think that there's there's just a lot of really really exciting um fun innovative rigorous uh differentiated experiences that we're dreaming up here um that will hopefully just make you know reading and writing classes that much more powerful and exciting for future learners oh here here who does not want to have more of that in your classroom and and save some time anybody anybody of course you want some time saved speaking of time unfortunately that is all the time we have for today thank you to my amazing panelists for sharing their insights and thoughts from their classroom experience and i just want to point out that we um want to continue to work with you if you want to work with us i mean a lot we we offer you can go right now and sign up for con academy but
