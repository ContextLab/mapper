Hi everyone, Sal here from Khan Academy and as some of y'all know I have released my second book, Brave New Words, about the future of AI in education and work. It's available wherever you might buy your books. But as part of the research for that book, I did some interviews with some fascinating people which you are about to watch. I have two very exciting guests today. I have Dr. Peggy Buffington, who's the superintendent of the Hobart School District in Indiana in the greater Chicago area, I guess we can say. And we also have Dr. Tim Krieg, who's the director of secondary curriculum and instruction at School City of Hobart. Welcome to both of you. Thank you for having us today. So let me just start. No, thanks for joining in. And let me just start with a very basic question before we get into some of the things that we've been collaborating with over the last several months. When chat GPT hit the scene at the end of November of 2022 or early December, and y'all started learning about it and maybe hearing the rumors that the students might be using it for essays or for other things. What was y'all's reactions? What were y'all thinking? What were you hearing from your teachers? Maybe start with you, Dr. Buffington. Well, at first, and just to give you some background in terms of technology use, you know, I started reading everything that I could about it and making an account, figuring out the intricacies of it. And I approached it in a sense that I would with any type of technology, which would be, wow, how are we going to integrate this, use it and not be afraid of it. And I think that that was the most important approach that I could take to it, just simply because this isn't something that let's just say when Google came out or when we first started introducing how to use the Internet. And I didn't really have a clue as to how they would integrate that with teaching or with their curriculum. So I immediately started thinking about how are we going to help people see this as a tool and they can't run from it. And basically what I really thought was going to happen is exactly what happened. Everybody turned to the plagiarism and are we going to do something to block this? And so I was like, whoa, wait just a second here. Let's try to figure out. First of all, we knew that you had to be 18 years old to use chat GPT, but we know that that doesn't stop kids from making fake accounts. And we knew that we were going to have this issue with it. And we have to we have to embrace and start figuring out how we're going to use it. And quite frankly, what's really interesting, Sal, is that I had a second grader that created his own recycled monster for a project. And his dad helped him go to chat GPT to write a story about it. So if second graders are going to already be using this, we have to see that this is going to be a tool that kids are going to embrace. So how do we teach them how to use it ethically? And it's their voice and not run from it. And so that was our position from the very beginning. But I can tell you that the teachers were all like, what are you going to do to block it? Until we started having this kind of dialogue, why would we block something that could potentially help the student? We just have to learn how to use it. Right? And how do you respond? Because a good number of those concerns are real. If you're I'm a humanities teacher and I'm used to assigning term papers and now students might be using chat GPT. And I think you can't detect it. I know there's folks who are claiming that they're going to create some technology, but you really can't detect it if someone's even vaguely creative about it. What have you been telling those or have you all started changing practice inside the district? And Dr. Buffet, you can continue that. I'm really curious in how you feel about these issues. Well, I mean, I am going to say that there were some some English teachers. You can imagine those are the first to speak up and say, wow, they're out policing. And and look, I think that this is this. And I ran this checker. And it was very interesting to see their approach to it. And one of the things that I really do believe is that we have to change the way we're assigning things to kids. And you're going to have to show them and teach them how to appropriately use it because there has to be discernment. There has to be ethical use of is this your voice or someone else's voice? And how do you prove that it's true? How are you citing it and all of these things? Because it just makes us look at things differently. Now, I don't know how quickly you want to get into our experiences with Con Amigo. But what I can say is that we started looking at even prior to piloting Con Amigo. What would be an acceptable use of a I. And before they started piloting, it was really about making sure that there's discernment, making sure that that we're representing your voice and you're not just copying and pasting something. So we started looking at perhaps a rubric with no A.I., a little bit of A.I. and what would you allow it to be used for? And then, you know, like, what does full blown A.I. look like? And are you going to use that for discourse and debate? So we kind of had started having that kind of conversation to not just completely ban it, but to talk about what would you allow? And then I think we'll get more into what we discovered with Con Amigo. But that's kind of the dialogue we started having with people. And it's super helpful. And Dr. Krieg, what's your point of view on both of those? What was your first reaction when you saw Chat GPT come on the scene? And what have you been hearing from your teachers and others about how to navigate it? It's a great question. And it's actually really interesting for me because Dr. Buffington had me leading a late start, which late start means for us, all of our staff is sitting together and the students come late. So we can do collective professional development. And I don't remember exactly what it was that I had the staff working on. But at the end, one of our engineering teachers came up to me and he said, and this was in November of 2022, and he said, hey, I responded to the question. He's like, what do you think about it? And so I read it and I said, wow, very, very well done, Daniel. This is great. And he goes, I didn't write it. And I said, OK. And so that was my first real iteration with Chat GPT that put it on the radar. Now, being one who is a former English teacher, I'd be remiss not to say at that point, what did I do? Right. Dr. Buffington talked about this. I like books. You can see books behind me. Dr. Buffington likes books. She has them all over. I started to research. Right. And quite frankly, I think there's something crippling about what I like to refer to as acronymitis, meaning we have acronyms for everything. And so dispelling this notion of like, what is that? Chat GPT or whatever the case may be. And you come to find out that all of this gets embedded into what's considered AI, artificial intelligence. And so that then kind of took me down a rabbit trail, if you will, to looking at what is AI and is this new or is it in a different iteration? Right. So I went from not having any idea what it was to then reading articles about major school districts in the country, for example, that we're going to ban this and so forth. At that point, I said to myself, well, you know, that's understandable. It's human nature, you know, survivalists to try to protect ourselves, right, and put up those hedges of protection. Well, then the more that you look into it, you know, as a former English teacher, I know that a lot of these terms that we use, like AI, for example, there are a lot of times based in things that are science, you know, science fiction related. I mean, you look all the way back at AI, and, you know, it's like the Wizard robots, you know, Tin Man, right? Like, is this possible, you know, that I can have a being, if you will, this creative thing that can reason, right? And so it's so fascinating, like a heartless Tin Man, right, and the concept of artificially intelligent robots, and you look back and this isn't anything new. It's taken on a different iteration as technology is caught up. And so, you know, I started to look into it and I'm like, oh my gosh, you know, back in the 1950s, you know, this was being talked about, right? And so philosophers were trying to explore this and there was a, I don't remember the guy's name, but a British mathematician that tried to create the possibility of, you know, is there a purpose? Yeah. And it was like, you see this all over fiction, you know, a little short story called The Most Dangerous Game and, you know, looking at animals and humans and the ability to reason as the differentiator. And so, you know, the problem was, as we all know, you know, technology wasn't ready, you know, at the time. And so you see this like whole notion of artificial intelligence that just went through decades of changes, right? It was like a roller coaster, it was up and down and all over the place. And so, you know, that then obviously led to the current era we're in where technology can keep up, right? And so now we see this really like societal shift where all of a sudden the engineering teacher is using this thing, but I don't even know what it is, you know, acronymitis, chat GPT. And what do you do? You put up your hedges of protection, right? Like, I don't know what this is and it's scary, right? And so I think one of the most important things to that point then was, you know, as soon as we had that conversation, you know, then like Dr. Buffington as the leader she is, she already knew about this. I was late to the party, right? But then we start to problem solve together and think and explore. And I think what makes this district unique and why we value the partnership we have with Khan and why I think we're on the line with you right now is just because, you know, think about brave new words. You know, Dr. Buffington is a trailblazer and she's not afraid to look at things in a non-binary way, right? Have or don't have good or bad. What about the gray areas, right? And these are tools just like calculators. You look at the changes to the new digital SAT. You know, they have a Desmos infused calculator that's there's no such thing anymore for the new SAT of a calculator, no calculator section. Well, this is the reality of where we are. And it doesn't necessarily have to be dystopian if we can, to Dr. Buffington's point, work with our staff and students to be wise stewards of these resources because it's not going to change, right? And so I think for me, you know, Dr. Buffington and her dissertation, you know, what do you start with? A definition of terms. And so when you start to research things, you start to realize, are we even talking about the same thing, right? Are we defining our terms or are we just going around and around and around about things that we don't even understand what they are, right? Right. Can I jump in there for just a second? Because one of the things is a technology user back in the day, back in the 80s, you know, and I did my internship with Apple Computer. I am an instructional design and, you know, and you're trying to figure out how do you get teachers to embrace technology, not be afraid of it. And you have to really say to yourself, the number one thing that they want to know is this, how is this going to make my my job better? How is it going to help my students? And if you can't sell them on that, you might as well forget it. And so then if you can sell them that it will make their job better and make achievement more accessible for their students and they're on board with that, then you have to lay out a good plan to teach them how to use it. And so what I really feel one of the first things that's so exciting about it is when you start talking to them about it is just making an account, right? You want to know how to make the best carbon era, ask that question, right? And see what you get. And they're fascinated by it. It's kind of like using the search engine for the first time and you come up with all these hits and then you say, well, you have to refine it to get what you want so you can regenerate questions, right? And so they find these little things to be fascinating. And then you take those extra little steps to show them things like how to generate an exit ticket. And then they're starting to see a little bit of use and they're going, whoa. So Case in point, the engineering teacher that was talking to Dr. Krieg, he comes up and he's like, wow, I just turned in my Harvard Educational Foundation grant and I wrote all of it in chat GPT. And of course he was awarded it. He had to go in and tweak a few things and he's like, it was amazing. And we're like, all right, great job. You found a use for it. My director of technology and my IT person, our student management system, something was not quite working right in a report that they had to do. They went behind in the back end and some code that they thought was wrong and they put it in and chat GPT and then it came back and it corrected. They were able to correct it and they said, wow, our food service director looking at something that they had to do for a federal report went out and was doing some things in chat GPT. Now, as we all know, it's not the end all be all. They do still have to check things and have discernment, right? So the point is, is that when you're introducing this, whether it's terms or whatever, if you can't show some great benefit, you're going to be turned off. And then I think the other aspect of this is teaching teachers once they see that resource side of it, because quite frankly, the resource side is really great for teachers when they start looking at it. How do I make assignments that utilize this type of technology? You know, and I think about that narrative, that essay. And, you know, when I think about 21st century skills with collaborating with a team and having like that discourse and debate over, you know, what is artificial intelligence telling you? And then you regenerate and you get another answer and another answer and you're on that team and you're discussing and debating what's accurate, what's real, what's possible. And then you're starting to formulate some sort of hypothesis or or or thematic type of situation where you're going to expand on it. I think that it has great potential when we teach people just how to use it appropriately. And we have to look to the future and say they're going to do this. Our competitors globally are going to use this. Why in the world would we ban something and then they're going to go out into the real world and use it. So it's our job to use it and use it well. Teach them ethical use, teach them how to strategically use it to get an end product. So I think that our teachers need that type of help. And so you start off with how does it benefit me as a teacher. And now how am I going to use this with my kids? And boy, do I have, you know, I have some really great ideas on how we can use this with kids just with I love the coaching aspect of it. I love the differentiation. But that's more on the con amigo side. And I know I know you're going to get to that with us because I do love con amigo. I'm just saying no, I mean, I have I'm biased. I love con amigo, but I get more enthusiastic about it every time I talk to you, Dr. Buffington. And, you know, for those listening, several of the teacher features are direct ideas from Dr. Buffington. So your feedback is definitely manifesting itself in our product. But let's let's let's switch gears to that because Hobart was already a district that was pretty engaged, heavily engaged using what's called pre-A.I. Khan Academy. Then we showed you all early demos of con amigo. And since March, I'll have been one of the first districts in the country, probably the world to use con amigo in a in a systematic way. And it seems in a productive way. What were what were y'all's original reactions to con amigo? What questions or aspirations do you still have for it? And what's been the experience like over the last several months? I'll start with you, Dr. Buffington, then go to Dr. Creek. Well, I I love the aspect of of confidence in a student. Right. So, I mean, anything that you want to read on student achievement has to start with building confidence that they they have within themselves that they they know they can do it. And and so our job then is to make sure that we're equipping them with the skills that they that they can manifest themselves and have this confidence level. And one of the things that that pre-COVID and then you can just now jump forward to COVID is that you just started to notice that kids really are not asking questions. They don't want to raise their hand. And then you're the teacher trying to pull. You're soliciting. You're coming up with hooks. You're trying to engage kids. It's difficult. And yet I can go to an elementary school. And what do I watch kids do on a Chromebook, an iPad, whatever? They're automatically going out, hitting the microphone, show me a blue snake and tell me why it's blue. Right. And they love that kind of stuff. And so they're so apt to talk to their device and they love the response that they get. And then it makes them a little more excited to ask it and get a little more specific with it. So one of the things that I love about about watching this with Conamego is just that that tutor, that guide on the side and kids not afraid to ask the device a question. And I think that it's ingenious because they'll sit and ask questions all day long. And if they have an assignment that is geared and let's just say it's the writing essay. And you know, Sal, when I first did the first talk with you, you're going to crack up at this. But you were talking about your son having to write an essay. Right. And so I only had five teachers that were piloting this. But yet I'm so excited about it. I'm talking to everybody about it. Right. And I'm like, you would not believe what Sal Khan showed us. And then I had a student that I was mentoring at the middle school and she's like, Dr. Buffington, is that AI stuff ready yet? Because she needed a writing coach. Right. And so then I'm like, well, I'll pretend to be AI like Conamego. And I said, I'll be your writing coach. And I was trying to pretend like asking, I would prompt a question like I would think that AI would do. And not that I replaced your Conamego, Sal. But here's what I can tell you. She wrote a six paragraph essay on mystery and it was beautiful. She needed that extra help with just asking questions and getting answers and pushing her a little bit. And it was beautiful. And one of the things that the feedback that our teachers told us, how great is it to have a tutor or an assistant or a coach when I'm not available? And they loved that because they see their and these are high school teachers that said, I'm not up at two in the morning when they're done playing Minecraft. And they decided to start writing their paper and boom, they have a teaching assistant and they're asking questions and they come to school and they feel confident in their work. And so I think that that is the beauty of this. Now, I'm still going to come back as your educator and make sure that that you have applied and it's your voice and you are representing what I've assigned to you. But wow, the confidence level in kids is amazing. And that's what I like about it. Anytime you can have a tutor write that in there. And I think that that is the best part of it. I do think that the feedback that we've been able to give you that you've made the program even better is the whole chat history. Right. So I can see how long you've engaged, what type of questions you're asking. And it's not just a quick get this done copy paste sort of thing. You really are out there using discernment, refining and asking the right questions to turn in a great piece of work. I love this about this questioning, tutoring, confidence building. That's all what we want for our students. You know, I hear two really powerful themes there. One is the confidence building aspect of it, which on introspection makes all the sense in the world of the students can just get more confident and get their questions answered. They're going to engage more. And then the other one, which you just alluded to, which is the process over just the output and that AI, interestingly, I think gives us a lens into the process that we never had before because you you're not going to see what a student is doing at two in the morning while they're writing their essay and they might be getting their older sister to write it for them or something like that. And now you get a lens. Dr. Krieg, what about yourself? You know, what was your initial reaction to Conmigo, especially vis-a-vis your reaction to chat GPT and how has been the experience so far? It's a great question. You know, quite frankly, when you, you know, that you can go to all different kinds of workshops and read books and, you know, it's it's helpful. It gives you a spark. But, you know, it's like, how do I take that spark in and really allow that spark to take on like an organic nature to it, to where it just becomes embedded in how you do things, right? We talk about culture. We talk about climate. And I see things like, you know, equity and access. And, you know, we talk about learning loss and we talk about, you know, how the Matthew effect, right? The haves keep having and the have nots don't. How do we get into that gap and truly provide opportunities? I was at a workshop yesterday with a colleague and we were looking at the new digital SAT. And my colleague, who's an educator and an involved parent, she said, she said, well, you know, I was working with my daughter and, you know, she didn't understand this, that and the other. And so, you know, I'm like, well, we can get you a tutor, you know, and that that that that that. And it really got me thinking about this again, because it's like, what about Conmigo? Well, we've to your point and to Dr. Buffington's point, we've been on, you know, the Khan Academy track for a long time now. I've used it from a student's perspective, a teacher's perspective and now through Khan Districts and administrative perspective. But what I'm seeing with Khanmigo is the ability to take the ideas that people have and really make it where it's it's systemic. And so I think as we move further and further away from rote memory and you start to see lines blurred. I mean, our students are creators, they're producers, they are songwriters, they are singers, they are podcasters, right? They're curators, they're consumers of media and information, but they're also creating it. And so what does all of that take? It takes increased depth of knowledge, complexity, interacting with materials, right? Interacting with concepts, et cetera. Well, the problem is if you think about the Matthew Effect and, you know, the ability of of some situations, socioeconomically and culturally, whereby they are able to fill gaps, identify them and fund them, what about everybody else? What about those who don't have access to such types of things? And even if they do, what if it's not working? And so we hear all about, you know, student apathy and lack of engagement and, you know, whatever the case is. And this is a question I'll ask. I'll say, OK, let's just say we do get your students attention. You have a captivated audience. What are you going to do with it? Let's flip the script on that, right? And so I think what's exciting to me as we as we use this beta mode of of ConMigo and as we're observing with it, you're seeing students interacting with knowledge and concepts in a way that's increasing the complexity of what they're doing. And it's not just a it's not a interact. It's not a the best way to put it would be transaction, right? It's not just, OK, I need this. You give me that. It's an ongoing relationship whereby students are interacting with new material or challenging themselves or expanding what they thought was to be true. And that re-ignition of learning is what we're all passionate about, right? So we talk here a lot about, you know, how do we find ways to marry up passions, purpose, possibilities, etc. And so when I look at ConMigo to Dr. Buffington's point, if I'm a teacher, it's not teaching for you, right? But what can it do? It can help refresh knowledge. It can, you know, create and partner with the teacher to create hooks, right? It can help the teacher by creating exit tickets with them. It can help with lesson planning. It can give, you know, there's even a neat little feature where you could take an entire lesson and it turns it into a fun little poem, right? You can co-create rubrics, all that kind of stuff, right? Learning objectives. Use it as a tool to Dr. Buffington's point. And then on the learner side, go ahead. I mean, like some of the most exciting things during the pilot that they were finding out that you could talk to a literary figure, oh my gosh, or you could talk to someone historically. And then you're, it just put them in the moment and it just brought learning to life. And so it's so engaging. You know, when I think about, for years we've said differentiation. And you know, that was one of the biggies on Khan Academy. And as you have said, and as Dr. Krieger have said, we were using Khan Academy. We were early adopters. I loved it. We had our own, we even made our own Khan Academy dictionary. It was pretty funny on how to use it. But what did I like about that? I liked that there was differentiation. There was that, that guide on the side, some extra help, right? And I see Khan Amigo as exactly that, but I also see it as totally engaging. So I can look at it, wow, differentiation. And as an educator, I really didn't have to do that much to provide that differentiation. And it is a guide on the side. But on the same token, it's not something that kids don't want to do. They like it. Now, one of our English teachers, and I totally cracked up at this, is that one of the kids said, and he was interacting with a historical figure with Khan Amigo. And the kids said, this is more fun than TikTok. So Sal, you've made it. It's more enlightening than TikTok. And when kids tell you that, you know, you got something there. But anyways, I think that that's a big plus with this. This is not where I just have to get my assignment done. They're actually out there and they're engaging with it and they're taking it to new levels. And we found with some of the kids that were a part of the pilot, they were doing things that were not part of their assignment. They were out creating things, creating like companies and putting in these scenarios. It was just hysterical. We didn't ask them to do that. They just really liked it. And so I think that that is what we want for kids. We want them to wonder. We want them to innovate. We want them to be problem solvers and go out there and take the information and do something with it. And that's what really happened with this. I do think, again, that beauty of just going back and looking at as an educator, the chat history, so I know what they're doing. I can see safety. I can see their work, etc. That's really important to educators. But I think this has opened up a whole different meaning to engagement. And what are they wondering? And what do they want to know more about? And what do they want to do with it? And I do find that the kids that we serve today, I do think that they have a heart for other people and they are problem solvers. I do think that they have an entrepreneurial being that they want to make things. And they want to be successful at it. They want it to serve other people, problem solving. And they want to be successful with what they've made. This is just such a game changer with equity. And I think that Dr. Krieg said that pretty well. I can take an English language learner, which we piloted with our EL teacher, and just a game changer for them. I mean, their primary language is not a stumbling block for them. They're on par with their classmates. And that's pretty awesome. One of the things too that we're talking to our AP chemistry teacher, also a dual credit early college teacher, just looking at some of the equations that they were doing in chemistry. And, you know, Conamico wouldn't give them the answer, but it was probing them to how to get the answer. And so our teachers loved that, you know, if you're at home trying to solve that problem and they can't help you, Conamico was there to assist them. Now, I will tell you that they all said that sometimes the kids started bullying AI, because they just wanted the answer. And it wouldn't do it. So that made the teachers pretty happy. Just to let you know, there's some feedback for you. There was a little bullying going on at times with Conamico. And, you know, it just kept prompting them and said, I'm not going to give you the answer. I think the golden rule should apply to AI. Treat the AI as you wish you were you're treated yourself. I mean, just continuing on that feedback lens. And I wasn't joking when you know our last meeting, we have several features on Conamico that directly came out of that meeting. So I'm going to continue to pick y'all's brain. You know, some of the things that we are working on above and beyond what you're already experiencing, we're working on giving the artificial intelligence, giving Conamico a sense of memory so that it knows the tone that a teacher or student prefers. It remembers previous conversations. It can pick up where you left off. We're adding things where teachers can assign through Conamico both traditional Khan Academy activities and AI activities and potentially fine tune the activity instead of saying talk to historical characters like, hey, I want you to talk to Benjamin Franklin and figure out the following. And so we're going to be doing things like that. We already have a little bit of this, but we're going to have more on reporting where Conamico really acts as a teaching assistant. You mentioned English language learners. We just released that it now works in every major language. And so a student could be doing their math or their chemistry in English, but they could be getting their help or their tutoring in Spanish or Portuguese or Hindi or whatever language they might need. And then the other thing that we are hoping to do, let's call it in the next six months, is have the AI, have activities that are multi-user, facilitate collaborative learning amongst many students. So you can imagine instead of having a debate with the AI, maybe the AI could facilitate a debate with several students or run a Socratic dialogue with several students or do a simulation or game with several students. So I'd love your thoughts are, what already exists or of that list that I just talked to you, maybe you're extra excited about, any ideas on how to tweak it, any concerns? And on the risk side, what would you like to see more of? Are there, have you been seeing problems that you want to make sure that we can address to just make things go smoother? I'll start with you, Dr. Buffington. Well, I think one of the things that we gave feedback on, obviously sometimes we pick up on things that are safety concerns for us. And I think that you addressed, you know, immediately you started digging into like, how can we make sure that if there is some sort of risk or to a student or to other people with just what we, there's an indicator system. And so we so appreciate that you took that feedback because a lot of the times we're able to pick that up in class or in some work or body of work that, or if a student has been talking to another student or a teacher, we're able to pick up some signs of things that where a student may need extra help because they're going through a very bad time. Or there is just some potential there for, you know, wrong application or something to that effect. And so I think that you took our feedback pretty well in terms of us having concern for kids that may need some extra social emotional support, or if their safety is being compromised in their home or with other people. I think that that was one of our biggest concerns when we first started the pilot, because we have things like that in place right now. And I see kids using Con Amigo more than, I mean, I just think they're going to use it a lot. And so if they're going to use that a lot, I like that you have built in some safety measures that was really important to us. In terms of going forward, I think engagement is really important and communicating with other people. Thank you so much for the language portion that you just created because I think that is vitally important right now. And I would just say one of the things that I think is really important, and I think this goes back to the age old question and we really get this from middle school kids more than anyone like why do I have to learn that? And I think having experts out in the field, if we could, besides the AI portion being that expert, when you're saying that they can communicate with other students, I would love to see a database or besides the AI expert, I would like to see experts out in the field. Because a lot of the times with college and career readiness and thinking about these are going to be our next leaders, you know, talking to people and understanding what they do for a living and how it might be changing and just the whole concept of AI. Let me give a case in point. So right now when you think about computer science and we're talking about coding and just trying to get kids to go into coding and computer science, it's going to be different now. AI gives it a whole different flavor. And I think that they need to be talking to besides the AI expert, who are those people out in the field, like your people, like how does this work behind the scenes and what you want to do this for for a living. And if you really enjoy it, it's really not even a job. But I think that there needs to be more of that. And so, you know, there's software out there that you can meet up with an expert here and expert there. But giving kids a real flavor for it. And then, I mean, you can still, if you're going to allow them to meet with other kids, I'd like to see them meet with other experts out in the field. It's a fascinating idea. I think you'll know we have another sister nonprofit that I started during the pandemic called Schoolhouse.world, which and the whole premise of Schoolhouse.world is connect the world through learning and give folks free live tutoring via video conference. And one of the things that we do that is by leveraging volunteers. Many of the volunteers are high school or college students, but many of them are professionals. And when we launched ConMigo, we started to think, well, maybe ConMigo could be an interesting bridge between traditional Con Academy and maybe something like Schoolhouse.world where you actually have real people showing up. And so, Peggy, your idea, I'm almost thinking of like, what if Schoolhouse.world, I think most professionals would love to give back in some way. They would love to tell, you know, most parents when they go home, they want to tell their kids about their job and their kids aren't interested. But the kids might be interested about other parents' jobs, which tends to be the case. And so there might be a fun way where you can show up on, say, a schoolhouse and then ConMigo can say, hey, you were wondering why this matters. There's a session that's happening. So-and-so is showing up who's an AI researcher or who's a doctor or who's a lawyer who can talk about wanting you go to that. And you'll learn a lot more about why this algebra is useful. So I love that idea. Dr. Krieg, more ideas. Keep them coming. Yeah, no. And fears and risks, because those are also ideas that, you know, opportunities for us to make it better. So quite frankly, to go right off that note, I remember as a student, I didn't understand why Shakespeare, for instance. And, you know, in college when I was an undergrad and then grad school and whatnot, I started to have a different appreciation for it. But ironically, to Dr. Buffington's point, what really started that was this short little video that I stumbled upon where there were actors and actresses who were talking about why Shakespeare. And for the first time, I started to view the theater, for example, not just in its own siloed reality, like, oh, this is theater, but as a bridge, if you will, like you mentioned, to all sorts of other occupations. And when you get to see and hear how things are hybrid now, right, things aren't siloed anymore. You can be in a subject and apply the concepts, the principles, the experiences to not just other things that you're doing currently, but the possibilities are endless because we really don't know how that's going to come up later on, right? We're not even always consciously aware of it. And so when I think about the current activities for students inside of Con through Con Nigo, I would encourage you to continue to look at ways to break silos down. And by that, I mean, you know, it's like modes of writing. Modes of writing for far too long were taught in a way that was singular. So it's like, this is expository writing. This is argumentative writing. This is narrative writing. But, you know, research shows that the writing process of our most successful authors, it mirrors those of small children prior to going through a traditional K-12 education system because of exactly what we talked about before, curiosity. Is it a discipline? Sure. Read Stephen King on writing. He will tell you it's a discipline. It's a science. But there has to be that passion. And so for me, I think about what's the difference between what we have done, what we are doing and what we could and should do. What we need to start to do, we could do and should do is break down the walls between classes, break down the walls between in school and out of school. Dr. Buffington could tell you that our most successful things going on right now have been organic and they then become systematic, where the engineering teacher partners up with business teacher who partners up with the teacher in Pilt W. Biomed. Why? Because they're aligned to passions. They're aligned to things you're interested in. So if I look at something like Craft a Story, understanding when you go out and you read and you listen to podcasts, part of argumentation is storytelling. Right? There's no such thing as, oh, this is expository writing, so I only exposit information. Right? Writing is messy. The writing process is nonlinear. Everything evolves and changes. So to Dr. Buffington's point, two things here. One, applying these topics in a way that makes it more and more seamless. And that's why I love your comment, Sal, about having the journey be something that is building upon itself. And if the AI capability is such to where it allows the learning progression to continue, that's a game changer. I had one of my best composition teachers in grad school. She talked about how writing should ultimately be assessed, not if these little, you know, like, oh, well, you took this class and earned an A or that class and earned a B. It should be where did the students start and then where did they end up at the natural end of the segment? And it's about that growth. Well, that growth is such to where you start to understand, oh, everything is rhetorical. Right? You go back to Plato, to Socrates, to Aristotle, whatever the case is, everything's rhetorical. Well, our students now are presenting to a world that is gigantic, but it can also be niche. Right? How can we take these things that they're learning about history, about technology, about engineering, about, you know, the human body, all these different things and say, this can apply to fields that don't even exist. This could end up applying. It could be sticky. Right? That's how our brains work. We need to stick information on the things that we already have frameworks built on in such a way that now I'm combining something I'm doing in class with the side hustle I have, you know, a shop that I do on the side or whatever, and also at home in my own personal and, you know, preferences or whatever the case may be. So, for example, if I listen to podcasts about, you know, sports related things, that may then change the way that I do a recorded, you know, session for staff because I like the way that they introduce this or that they, you know, use voice inflection there and whatnot. So my encouragement would be twofold. One, continue to break those silos down to show how this all this stuff fits into other stuff. Right? And then two, there's a little bit right now in ConMigo as it relates to like navigating college admissions and financial aid, you know, and then also like the career aspect. So I would say I would encourage you to continue to connect students and what they're learning about or could learn about with then what. And when you think about like the state of Indiana, for example, a lot of what Dr. Buffington and I and our team are doing here is helping align what students are doing now with stackable credentials of currency, showing future employers scholarship committees, etc., that I have mastery of something or proficiency or something or experience in something. We see this even with digital badges and things of that nature. So when a student sees a career path, it's intimidating because the language that's used to characterize it might not have anything to do with really what the occupation entails and or the future occupations I may use these things for. Don't even exist. Right. And so how can we try to marry those worlds up to connect students present with their future in the shorter term as well as, you know, the opportunities there that exist thereafter that we don't even know of yet. I love that this kind of theme of breaking down barriers between subjects, which I think is now more doable than ever. And then also between school and the real world. One last question for you, Dr. Buffington. Let's fast forward, I don't know, two, three years. It doesn't have to be a long time, but things are changing very fast. Do you think that everything we've talked about is going to somehow fundamentally alter what school is like, including we didn't even talk about things like assessment, which we are starting to think about on our side. Or do you think it'll just be a nice supplement on top of the existing architecture? Do you think in some ways it changes the classroom fundamentally, Dr. Buffington? Well, I mean, Tim will know this, Dr. Krieg. I mean, I had the philosophy that, you know, during COVID that the landscape was forever changed. Right. I mean, it's already changed. If I don't want to come to my public institution and sit all day, I can choose to go to an online school. And, you know, maybe that works for me. I think that I think when I look at this, I don't want to view this as supplemental. I want to view this as a tool that is a tool that is, you know, it's usable now, but it's also able to help us in the future. You know, when I think about things and I think about college career readiness and, you know, right now I can let a kid get out early, graduate early. And, you know, I have kids that are graduating with associate's degrees in our high school right now. What do I see potentially happening here? I see what people want with the kids that are graduating from high school now. They want them to be problem solvers. They want them to be able to collaborate and work on a team. They want them to have ethical practices behind them. And I think that you already have the potential with this. Now, the interesting thing is, is that how do I give a student an internship? And maybe in Con Amigo, there's an internship aspect of this and it counts for their day. You know, so do I'm all about reinventing the high school and what that looks like. And, you know, I think that that funnels down to, you know, middle school elementary. I think there's so many different aspects of this AI that I could explore. You know, when I think about kids want to have fun. They don't want to dread assignments. I already see that that part is cured. I see kids going on there just because they want to and they like asking questions. And that's what we want as educators. We want them asking questions and they're fascinated by it. And so I want to take that fascination and build on it. And if that means redesigning the way we do school, then we have to do that. Right. And so we already we already have some redesigning and reinventing our high schools with early college. And, you know, you can get industry certifications one year of college, two years of college. You don't necessarily need to go five days a week. You don't maybe need to go a whole day. Yeah. Because you can have a different opportunity. And if that opportunity presents itself in such a way, your credential to graduate and perhaps even enter the workforce or enter post-secondary to further explore what we're trying to do. And so I think that we need to be able to achieve with, you know, some post-secondary credential that that contributes to the world. And so I'm all about is there better ways, more efficient ways or more exciting, engaging ways to reinvent things that we're doing. And so I think that I think like anything that's been new to education, sometimes we are the last adopters. And so why? And I think we started talking about this. They're afraid of it. And you can't be afraid of it. You have to embrace what the future is. And so I think there's going to be some adaptability when you're talking about supplemental, right? I mean, like, so right now you're going to have early adopters that are going to basically take something that they have in their curriculum map and say, how does AI help me? How might I use Con Amigo? And then you're going to start seeing some trailblazing where it'll be like, whoa, I'm not you. I'm not. It's not a replacement. And you're going to see them start using it in a way that it that that enhances even more. And it's not replacing like what they did. And it's and it's pushing kids to grow and learn and perhaps come up with an idea that they might cure something. You know, I love the fact that this is a generation that likes to problem solve. And they'll they'll say, like, what about this or what about that? And and I think that this has the potential to do that. So if I have a student and, you know, to talk about what we were talking about, we will put kids in a biomedical class and then we will have them butt up with the engineering program because they're thinking about one thing. And these are the people over here. They can really build it for you or help you with your your calculations or whatever. Those barriers are broken. And I see I see high school being totally reinvented with giving kids the opportunity to apply this in a real world setting. And so I think that there's room for this. And I'm just going to give you a concept here of, you know, Indiana is doing something with career scholarship accounts. They're called CSA's. And it's really meant to put kids out into the workforce and workplace, workplace learning and internships. And they're already on the cusp of what would a high school diploma look like with a kid that we give this CSA to? And is it really the traditional like you have to have 40 credits of this and that and that. And they're starting to see, well, maybe they don't need that. And maybe just maybe they're going to be somebody that I put out in the workforce that has some know how with using technology in an appropriate way and come up with a solution for something that they've been struggling to find. I think the potential is there for that. I think you're going to see early adopters supplementing, replacing and then finding new things. And then I think you're going to see kids be like, I could do this. I could do that. And we're going to have to re look at the way we're delivering to allow growth, if that makes sense. Makes a ton of sense. And I could talk to both of y'all for hours, especially about this topic because it's so fascinating. But I love that kind of final push where break all the boundaries. And actually we always get our ideas from activity ideas from you, Dr. Buffington. And you kind of reinforced something that we were brainstorming, which is what if there was an activity for students or for teachers or for anyone to solve big problems in the world? You need to tackle climate. You want to figure out how can I as a student start to tackle climate change? How is I as a student can start to tackle cancer research? How can I as a student start to tackle, I don't know, whatever issue in the world you think needs solving. A lot of students want to, but they don't know where to start. Where do they, so I like that idea as well. Well, thank you both. And Sal, can I just mention in terms of what you just said and how important it is? And they try to solve things that are so important to them. So during COVID, one of my students was trying to figure out how to have a better check in system with symptoms in the emergency room. And why she wanted it to notify them that you have to re-prioritize who's in your emergency room because your grandfather died from COVID. So I had this little entrepreneur innovator and we have maker spaces here. We do, you know, we do maker spares. We have, and we have STEM spaces everywhere. And her creation was, and she worked with the engineers at the hospital on symptoms and where they're at and how to re-prioritize who you're going to see first because it was so real to her. And to you, you know, when you're saying climate change, the things that really matter to them, they will spend all day. That is the type of student that won't go to bed because they're out there trying to figure out where's the information, what type of tool, what kind of instrument. She's in the BioMed class, goes down to the engineering class and they're creating a handheld and it's going to sync with watches or whatever at the hospital to change the priority of like, who do you need to see now? And I just think that our kids have that potential, right? And so guess what? That didn't happen in her classroom. That happened outside of her classroom, but she brought it into the classroom that there has to be a better way, right? And so I think that this opens up all kinds of avenues of questions or problems that they want to solve and it gives them a good start and it will make them want to keep going after it. You know what I mean? And I think it's the beauty of it. It's so engaging. They don't want to stop. 100%. Sal, if I may, just on both of our behaves, thank you for, that's what you did, right? You started by identifying a problem, a need, right? That was personal to you in a familial sense. And you asked a lot of questions and you trailblazed and then here we are, right? And so what our hope is, is that as passionate as the three of us are, for example, about education and, you know, ConMigo and just different ways to try to help our students, you know, be on mission to be able to pursue their passions. If they can have that same kind of passion about things that they're interested in and we're marrying up the possibilities where they can pursue them, then, you know, education may look different, but the fundamental, you know, true North Star remains the same, right? And then we just go about it in different ways, you know, but the why is still there. The denominator is still there and that's our kids. That's our students. And so just thank you, I think, on both of our behaves for championing that. No, well, thank you all for being part of this. Oh, hey, this was the best thing ever. I mean, I'm not kidding you. I could sit and talk with the teachers and the kids that were using this. I could sit with them all day and I and they were sending me things that they were creating out of ConMigo and I was loving it and I have other work to do, but I wanted to read what they were doing with it. And, you know, I think just a kudos and thank you for including us in the pilot. I think that we will will be trailblazers with going out and talking to people about how, you know, how to break the barriers and how to use it. But you can't do that without giving people an initial start, right? And you did that. And I'm just telling you, it's fascinating to sit and talk to these teachers about how they think they're going to use it next. And so thank you for that. You've taken something that I think that they were so afraid of, especially the English teachers, and they're not afraid of it. And so they know how they're going to approach it. They're, you know, they did talk to our Secretary of Education, Katie Jenner, which is interesting because you had talked to Katie Jenner and she's like, hey, I want to talk to those teachers. And so we lined it up and she was fascinated by it too. So you've taken something and given us a really good tool to use in education. And for that, we're grateful for it. And I can't wait to see the next version. No, we're excited. And I think this is going to be one of many conversations over the next few months and years as we go on this adventure together. But thank you because, you know, obviously we can do all this work. But if we're not serving the needs of school leaders and teachers and students, then why are we doing this? So it means a lot to be able to partner with y'all. Thank y'all. Thank you, Sal.
