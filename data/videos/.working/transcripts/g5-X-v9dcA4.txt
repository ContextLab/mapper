Hi, my name is Mowi El-Dib. I was born in Egypt, worked on a farm till third grade, and then I came with my family to the USA and I continued working and also going to school since we had to, but working full-time didn't make school go. I was mostly sleeping and I wasn't doing well at all and I continued that same exact way till eighth grade and my family was also in the middle going back and forth between Egypt and here and nobody had decided yet exactly what we're doing, but then when high school started, two weeks in my house burned and I was like that's it for school and there's no way it's gonna work out anymore, but after a year and a half of being homeless and on a shelter, my family was able to move in somewhere stable and life was getting a little stable so I was willing to give high school another shot and let's see if I could really, if school would actually work out for me. Thank God I found Khan Academy and they had everything that I needed because I needed pre-pre algebra to actually start my way and actually be able to learn at an equal level so they had it all for me, you know, they had pre-algebra and then pre and then they had algebra and then they they had the whole path just set up right there for you where I didn't even have to organize it or find someone to help me organize or figure out what I would do and I went down through every video and as I learned and I learned and things were getting easier and the pace was what I wanted, they motivated me a lot that I felt like I could actually learn and I was learning and getting happier and things were working out you know and I continued that same way and that even drove in a love for math for me and after finishing every video that was there I finished high school in that year and a half I graduated in 11th grade after finishing 11th grade and I was I went to Queens College and I knew I could learn math so I continued learning math and Khan Academy was still there for me they had calculus and they had they continued to statistics and probability and every class that I needed to continue to get my to do well in math and I was able to finish in my applied math degree in two and a half years and now I'm doing my second bachelor's here at Columbia University after transferring here.
