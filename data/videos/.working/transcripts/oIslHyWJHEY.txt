The quadratic expression x squared plus five x plus c is a perfect square and it can be factored as x plus d squared. Both c and d are positive rational numbers. So what I want to figure out in this video is what is c, given the information that we have right over here, what is c going to be equal to and what is d going to be equal to? And like always, pause the video and see if you can figure it out. Well let's work through this together. We're saying that x squared plus five x plus c can be rewritten as x plus d squared. So let me write that down. So this part, this part, x squared plus five x plus c we're saying that that could be written as x plus d squared. This is equal to x plus d squared. Now we can rewrite x plus d squared as going to be equal to x squared plus two x, two, let me write two d x, two d x plus d squared. If this step right over here you find strange, I encourage you to watch the videos on squaring binomials or on perfect square polynomials, either one. So you can see the pattern that this is going to be x squared plus two times the product of both of these terms plus d squared. And so when you look at it like this you can start to pattern match a little bit. You can say all right, well five x right over here, that is going to have to be equal to two d and then you can also say that c is going to have to be equal to d squared. So once again we could say two d is equal to five, or that d is equal to five halves. So we figured out what d is equal to and now we can figure out what c is because we know that c needs to be equal to d squared. C, let me do that orange color actually. So we know that c is equal to d squared, which is the same thing as five half squared. We just figured out what d is equal to. It's going to be five half squared, which is going to be 25 over four. So c is equal to 25 over four, d is equal to five halves. And we're done.
