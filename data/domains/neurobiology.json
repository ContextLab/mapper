      "options": {
        "A": "The Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and potassium leak channels work together: the pump maintains ion concentration gradients (high K⁺ inside, high Na⁺ outside), and the membrane at rest is primarily permeable to K⁺ through leak channels, so K⁺ flows outward down its concentration gradient until the electrical force (negative interior) balances the concentration gradient — as described by the Nernst equation for potassium",
        "B": "Chloride ions are actively and continuously pumped into the cell by a dedicated Cl⁻ ATPase pump, creating a large intracellular excess of negative charge that produces the -70mV resting membrane potential",
        "C": "The membrane potential is negative because neurons contain substantially higher concentrations of negatively charged proteins and nucleic acids than other cell types in the body",
        "D": "Sodium channels are constitutively open at rest, producing a continuous inward sodium current that drives the membrane potential to approximately -70mV. This resting sodium conductance is the primary determinant of the resting potential, and the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump serves only as a minor corrective mechanism. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation confirms that the resting potential is dominated by sodium permeability, which is approximately ten times greater than potassium permeability at rest, contrary to the common textbook claim that potassium dominates"

      "options": {
        "A": "Astrocytes generate full sodium-dependent action potentials identical to those produced by neurons and directly excite neighboring neurons by releasing glutamate through voltage-gated exocytotic mechanisms at specialized astrocyte-neuron synapses. These astrocytic action potentials propagate through astrocyte networks at the same speed as neuronal conduction, creating a parallel information processing system that doubles the computational capacity of neural circuits",
        "B": "Astrocytes form the tripartite synapse: they ensheathe synapses with fine processes, take up neurotransmitters (especially glutamate via EAAT1/2 transporters), regulate extracellular K⁺, release gliotransmitters (glutamate, D-serine, ATP) that modulate synaptic transmission, and provide metabolic support (astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle). They respond to neuronal activity via metabotropic receptors and intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling",
        "C": "Astrocytes serve exclusively as passive structural scaffolding elements that physically hold neurons in place within the brain parenchyma, providing mechanical support without any involvement in synaptic signaling, neurotransmitter metabolism, ion homeostasis, or any other active biological process. Their elaborate branching morphology exists solely to fill the extracellular space and prevent neurons from shifting position during head movement",

        "B": "The AIS is anatomically much thicker than the neuronal soma, giving it dramatically lower axial resistance and allowing current to flow more easily to this region than to thinner parts of the neuron",
        "C": "The AIS has a uniquely high density of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.6 with low threshold, Nav1.2) clustered by the scaffolding protein ankyrin-G, giving it the lowest threshold for action potential initiation — it acts as a coincidence detector integrating thousands of synaptic inputs from the somatodendritic compartment",

        "A": "Microglia actively form new excitatory synapses between neurons by secreting synaptogenic proteins such as thrombospondin and hevin at sites of neural circuit remodeling, effectively functioning as synapse construction workers rather than pruning agents. This synaptogenic role is particularly prominent during early postnatal development when circuit formation is most active",
        "B": "Microglia replace dying neurons by differentiating into fully functional new neurons through a transdifferentiation process mediated by transcription factors Ascl1 and Brn2. This microglial neurogenesis is the primary mechanism of neural repair following stroke and traumatic brain injury, and it explains why microglial activation after injury is consistently associated with functional recovery rather than ongoing neurodegeneration",
        "C": "Microglia generate and maintain the blood-brain barrier by wrapping their ramified processes around brain capillaries and forming tight junctions with endothelial cells, replacing the barrier function traditionally attributed to astrocyte end-feet. According to this model, microglial depletion should catastrophically disrupt the blood-brain barrier, leading to uncontrolled infiltration of blood-borne pathogens and immune cells into the CNS parenchyma",
        "D": "Microglia actively prune excess synapses during development through complement-mediated phagocytosis: weak or inactive synapses are tagged with complement proteins (C1q, C3), which microglia recognize via complement receptor CR3 and engulf — sculpting neural circuits by eliminating unnecessary connections"

Hippocampal neurogenesis is thought to support pattern separation — the ability to distinguish similar memories by providing fresh, highly excitable neurons with unique connectivity that create distinct memory traces for similar experiences",

The initial reports of adult-born neurons in the human hippocampus by Eriksson et al. (1998) using BrdU labeling have been thoroughly refuted by multiple independent groups using more sensitive and specific detection methods including carbon-14 retrospective birth-dating and single-nucleus RNA sequencing.

      "options": {
        "A": "The NMJ uses a completely different neurotransmitter from all central nervous system synapses — the motor neuron releases a unique catecholamine called motorin that activates specialized ionotropic receptors found exclusively on skeletal muscle fibers. This neurotransmitter specificity, rather than any quantitative difference in vesicle release, explains why NMJ transmission is reliable while central synapses are probabilistic",
        "B": "The NMJ has an extremely high safety factor: each motor neuron terminal releases ~100-200 vesicles per action potential (vs. ~1-10 at central synapses), and the postsynaptic muscle endplate has a very high density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors concentrated in junctional folds. The resulting endplate potential is 3-4× larger than threshold, ensuring reliable 1:1 transmission",
        "C": "Muscle fibers are electrically coupled to motor neurons through gap junctions that directly connect the motor neuron axon terminal cytoplasm to the muscle fiber sarcoplasm, allowing ionic current to flow bidirectionally without any chemical synaptic transmission. This direct electrical coupling explains the high reliability of neuromuscular transmission — there is no synaptic delay, no dependence on neurotransmitter release, and no possibility of transmission failure",

The developing nervous system produces vastly more axons than needed, and the small fraction that happen to reach appropriate targets by random exploration are stabilized while the rest are eliminated by apoptosis. This random-search-and-selection model explains why neural development is so metabolically expensive and why such a large proportion of immature neurons die during embryogenesis",
        "B": "Only one single molecular guidance cue — nerve growth factor (NGF) — is responsible for guiding all axons in the entire nervous system to their correct targets. NGF is released by target tissues in concentration gradients, and every growing axon regardless of type follows these NGF gradients through identical receptor-mediated chemotactic mechanisms. The diversity of axon trajectories observed during development results from differences in NGF gradient geometry created by the spatial arrangement of target tissues, not from any diversity of guidance molecules",
        "C": "Axons are guided exclusively by endogenous electrical fields generated by ion channel activity in surrounding tissues, and they do not respond to any molecular guidance cues. These bioelectric fields create voltage gradients that orient the growth cone through a process called galvanotropism, in which negatively charged cell surface glycoproteins are redistributed by the electric field, causing asymmetric adhesion and directional growth. All known molecular guidance molecules (netrins, slits, semaphorins, ephrins) are actually regulators of the bioelectric field rather than direct guidance cues",
        "D": "The four canonical families are: Netrins (attract or repel via DCC/UNC5 receptors), Slits (repel via Robo receptors), Semaphorins (mostly repel via Plexin/Neuropilin receptors), and Ephrins (contact-mediated repulsion or attraction via Eph receptors). Growth cones integrate these signals through receptor-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements — attraction involves actin polymerization toward the signal, repulsion involves growth cone collapse via RhoA activation. The same cue can attract or repel depending on intracellular conditions (e.g., cAMP/cGMP ratio)"

These form a tight four-helix bundle that pulls the vesicle and plasma membranes together. The complex alone mediates constitutive fusion; Ca²⁺-triggered synchronous release requires synaptotagmin-1, whose C2 domains bind Ca²⁺ and insert into the membrane, catalyzing the final energy barrier for fusion within ~200 microseconds of Ca²⁺ entry",

        "D": "Calcium ions directly catalyze the fusion of lipid bilayers without any protein involvement whatsoever, inserting themselves between the polar headgroups of both the vesicle and plasma membranes and creating a continuous hydrophobic bridge that allows the two bilayers to merge spontaneously. The SNARE hypothesis was proposed before the direct fusogenic activity of calcium was discovered and has been abandoned by the field, though it persists in outdated textbooks. Modern biophysical experiments using purified lipid vesicles have conclusively demonstrated that calcium alone is sufficient for membrane fusion at physiological concentrations"

      "options": {
        "A": "Synaptic scaling is functionally identical to long-term potentiation — it selectively strengthens the most active synapses on a neuron while leaving inactive synapses unchanged. The term 'scaling' refers to the fact that the magnitude of potentiation scales with the initial strength of each synapse, so that already-strong synapses are strengthened even further. This positive feedback mechanism amplifies differences between strong and weak synapses, creating a winner-take-all competitive dynamic that sharpens neural representations by enhancing the most informative inputs at the expense of weaker background activity",
        "B": "Synaptic scaling is a cell-wide mechanism that multiplicatively adjusts all of a neuron's synaptic inputs up or down to maintain a target firing rate. When a neuron's activity is chronically reduced, it scales up all excitatory synapses (by inserting more AMPA receptors) and scales down inhibitory synapses; chronic overactivity triggers the opposite. This is necessary because Hebbian plasticity is inherently destabilizing (positive feedback: strong synapses get stronger), and without homeostatic counterbalance, networks would either fall silent or saturate",
        "C": "Synaptic scaling occurs exclusively during sleep and plays no role in waking plasticity or real-time circuit regulation. The scaling process requires the complete suppression of neural activity that occurs only during slow-wave sleep, when neurons are silenced for extended periods and can safely undergo the wholesale receptor trafficking required for multiplicative synaptic adjustment",
        "D": "Synaptic scaling randomly changes the weights of individual synapses with no systematic relationship to the neuron's overall activity level or any homeostatic set point. The randomness of the scaling process introduces beneficial stochastic noise into neural circuits that prevents them from becoming trapped in stable but suboptimal activity patterns, serving a function analogous to simulated annealing in computational optimization. This noise-injection interpretation explains why synaptic scaling is enhanced during sleep, when the brain can tolerate random perturbations without impairing ongoing behavior"

      "options": {
        "A": "All microglial activation is inherently and invariably neurotoxic, with no beneficial or neuroprotective function under any circumstances. Activated microglia release exclusively pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and excitotoxic glutamate that damage neurons and exacerbate injury. The concept of 'beneficial' or 'protective' microglial activation is a misinterpretation of experimental artifacts caused by incomplete microglial depletion in knockout studies, where residual microglia-derived trophic factors confounded the results. Therapeutic strategies should therefore focus exclusively on complete microglial suppression or elimination following any form of brain injury or neurodegenerative disease",
        "B": "The M1 (pro-inflammatory, classically activated) and M2 (anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated) polarization framework remains the current standard model for describing microglial activation states in contemporary neuroscience research. Under this binary classification, microglia adopt one of two mutually exclusive phenotypes depending on the nature of the activating stimulus: M1 microglia are activated by pathogens and produce inflammatory mediators, while M2 microglia are activated by anti-inflammatory cytokines and promote tissue repair. All microglial responses can be accurately classified into one of these two discrete categories, and the M1/M2 framework provides a complete and sufficient description of microglial functional diversity",
        "C": "Early microglial responses to injury are often neuroprotective (debris clearance, trophic factor release, containment of damage). Chronic or dysregulated activation becomes neurotoxic (sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine release, reactive oxygen species, complement-mediated synapse elimination). The M1/M2 framework (borrowed from macrophage biology) was abandoned because single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that microglia in vivo adopt a continuum of transcriptional states — disease-associated microglia (DAM), lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia (LDAM), and proliferative-region-associated microglia (PAM) — that do not map onto the binary M1/M2 classification",
        "D": "Microglia respond identically to all types of brain injury and neurodegenerative disease through a single stereotyped activation program, making phenotypic classification unnecessary and scientifically meaningless. Whether the insult is traumatic injury, ischemic stroke, viral infection, or progressive neurodegeneration, microglia activate the same transcriptional program, release the same cytokine profile, and perform the same phagocytic and inflammatory functions. The apparent diversity of microglial responses reported in the literature reflects methodological differences between laboratories and variations in tissue processing protocols rather than genuine biological heterogeneity in vivo"

This direct mechanical coupling between neurons and vasculature was discovered by two-photon imaging studies showing that dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons extend specialized contractile filaments that contact and constrict or dilate nearby capillaries in response to synaptic activity. The astrocytes and pericytes previously thought to mediate neurovascular coupling are actually passive structural elements that play no role in blood flow regulation",
        "B": "The neurovascular unit comprises neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Active neurons release glutamate, which activates astrocytic mGluRs, triggering Ca²⁺-dependent release of vasoactive agents (prostaglandins, EETs, K⁺) from astrocyte end-feet onto arterioles, causing vasodilation and increased local blood flow (functional hyperemia). Pericytes control capillary diameter. fMRI's BOLD signal detects the resulting changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration — it is an indirect measure of neural activity mediated by the neurovascular coupling cascade, with ~5-8 second hemodynamic delay",

        "B": "Synaptic vesicles are never recycled at all — new vesicles are synthesized de novo in the neuronal soma, packaged with neurotransmitter, and transported along the axon by kinesin motor proteins for each individual release event",
        "C": "The three modes are: (1) Kiss-and-run — the vesicle opens a transient fusion pore, releases transmitter, and reseals without full collapse, enabling the fastest recycling (~1s); (2) Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) — after full vesicle collapse into the membrane, clathrin-coated pits form to retrieve membrane and proteins, taking ~15-30s; (3) Activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) — during intense stimulation, large membrane invaginations are internalized and processed into new vesicles. Kiss-and-run predominates during low-frequency firing, CME during moderate activity, and ADBE during high-frequency bursts when CME cannot keep pace",
        "D": "Vesicle recycling occurs exclusively during prolonged periods of neural silence when no synaptic transmission is occurring, because the endocytic machinery requires a quiescent, unstimulated presynaptic membrane to assemble properly. During sustained high-frequency firing, all fusion-competent vesicles are expended without recycling, and transmission ceases entirely until a recovery period of silence allows the clathrin-coated pit machinery to reassemble and retrieve the fused vesicle membranes from the expanded plasma membrane. This activity-dependent pause in transmission explains the synaptic fatigue observed at many central synapses and the obligatory recovery periods between bursts of high-frequency firing"

The PNN matrix is deposited at equal density around excitatory pyramidal neurons, inhibitory interneurons, neuromodulatory neurons, and glial cells alike. The claim that PNNs preferentially surround fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons is based on sampling bias in early immunohistochemical studies that used antibodies with inadvertent selectivity for parvalbumin-expressing cells, and more comprehensive modern analyses using unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomics have demonstrated uniform PNN distribution",
        "B": "Perineuronal nets are artifacts of histological fixation and staining procedures that do not exist in living brain tissue. The lattice-like structures observed in Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-stained tissue sections are produced by chemical cross-linking of normally diffuse extracellular matrix components during aldehyde fixation, creating an artificial condensation of glycoproteins around high-activity neurons that generates spurious staining patterns. In vivo two-photon imaging of the extracellular space in awake behaving animals has never revealed any PNN-like structures in living cortex, confirming that they are fixation artifacts without any functional significance",

PNNs have no role whatsoever in regulating synaptic plasticity, critical period timing, memory consolidation, or any other neural circuit function. Their composition of proteoglycans and hyaluronan gives them shock-absorbing viscoelastic properties similar to articular cartilage, and they are concentrated around the most mechanically vulnerable neurons in cortical areas that experience the greatest physical deformation during traumatic head impacts",
        "D": "PNNs are composed of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), hyaluronan, tenascin-R, and link proteins that condense around fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons during postnatal development. Their formation coincides with critical period closure — the transition from highly plastic juvenile circuits to stable adult circuits.

        "A": "Neurotrophins are released exclusively and only during the embryonic developmental period and have absolutely no function whatsoever in the adult brain — once neural circuits are established during development, BDNF, NGF, NT-3, and NT-4 are completely downregulated and play no role in adult synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, dendritic remodeling, spine morphogenesis, memory formation, or any other form of experience-dependent neural modification in the mature nervous system",

        "C": "All four neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4) are completely identical proteins encoded by the exact same single gene that share the identical amino acid sequence, identical three-dimensional protein folding structure, identical receptor binding profile and binding affinity constants, identical downstream intracellular signaling cascades, identical target cell populations, and identical developmental and adult expression patterns and physiological functions",
        "D": "The neurotrophic hypothesis proposes that developing neurons compete for limited quantities of target-derived trophic factors, and those that fail to obtain sufficient support undergo apoptosis — in the adult brain, BDNF acts as an activity-dependent modulator of synaptic strength, being released in response to neural activity and facilitating LTP induction, dendritic growth, spine morphogenesis, and the conversion of early-LTP to late-LTP through protein synthesis signaling"

        "B": "NMDA receptors open in response to postsynaptic membrane depolarization alone with absolutely no requirement for presynaptic glutamate binding, ligand activation, or any form of neurotransmitter release — the channel is a purely voltage-gated conductance that detects only postsynaptic activity, making it incapable of serving as a coincidence detector for simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic activity as proposed by Hebb's rule of associative learning",

        "A": "SCN1A sodium channel mutations cause Dravet syndrome by increasing inhibition throughout the brain, making all neurons substantially less excitable and thereby preventing the generation of seizures — loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.1 channels uniformly reduce the firing capacity of both excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons to exactly the same degree, producing a balanced reduction in network activity that results in hypoexcitability rather than the hyperexcitability and seizures actually observed clinically",
        "B": "SCN1A mutations cause Dravet syndrome because they primarily affect inhibitory interneurons — loss-of-function mutations in the Nav1.1 sodium channel reduce interneuron excitability more than excitatory neuron excitability (because interneurons rely more heavily on Nav1.1), leading to disinhibition of excitatory circuits and resulting in seizures, demonstrating the counterintuitive principle that loss of sodium channel function can cause hyperexcitability through preferential impairment of inhibition",
        "C": "Dravet syndrome is not caused by any ion channel gene mutation, any genetic variant, or any form of channelopathy of any kind whatsoever — it results exclusively and entirely from gross structural brain malformations including focal cortical dysplasia, periventricular and subcortical neuronal heterotopia, bilateral polymicrogyria, and severely abnormal neuronal migration patterns that disrupt normal cortical circuit architecture and predispose to recurrent intractable seizures through purely structural mechanisms",
