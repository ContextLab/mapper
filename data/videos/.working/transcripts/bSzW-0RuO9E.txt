All right. Welcome everyone. This is Jeremy Sheepling with Khan Academy. I am so thrilled to welcome you back for round two of our AI and education webinar series this summer. I know that this summertime is your time, and so I apologize for intruding upon it, but I'm so thrilled that you decide to join us because we have a rock star panel here. We have a couple of incredible educators from across the universe. We've got Emily and Kelly coming to you from the Khan World School in partnership with ASU. They're sweating it out right now down in Phoenix, as you've probably heard about. We have Madeline coming from the school city of Hobart in Indiana, one of our amazing Khan Academy District's partners, and one of the pioneers in using Khan-Migo in the classroom. Then we have Malia from our OG Khan Lab School right here in Mountain View, California. We have lots of different perspective represented. Then of course, a man who needs no introduction. Sal Khan himself is on the line, ladies and gentlemen, here to tell you about Khan-Migo and what the future looks like in this space. Now, that being said, before we dive in, we want to get to know you a little bit better. What I'm going to do is I'm going to launch a poll right now, and I'd love to hear from you. Where are you coming from occupationally? Are you a classroom teacher, a counselor, an instructional coach? Let us know right in the chat. Number two, let us know the kinds of students you serve. Are you on the older end of the spectrum, like so many of the educators here? Or maybe your early childhood. I was a former kindergarten teacher. I'd love to hear from that perspective as well. And then finally, let us know your primary subject area. We definitely have a lot of really strong humanities folks, but Sal himself has volunteered to speak directly to the math and science angles if you're curious as well. So with about five seconds left, five, four, three, two, and one, we'll end the poll. Let's share these results out. So as you can see, a ton of classroom teachers, which is awesome, but also some admins, instructional coaches, librarians, curriculum developers love to see that. We have a pretty even mix across elementary, middle, and high with a little sort of preference for the latter, but even some folks all the way to college and adult education, which is fantastic. And then finally, as you might expect, we've got a strong showing from the math educators out there, but lots of great folks in science, ELA, social studies, and beyond. So with that said, quick ground rules before we dive in. This session is going to be recorded. I know it's the number one question that everyone has asked in every webinar ever since the pandemic. And yes, you will absolutely get a copy sent directly to your email afterwards. However, what's more, because you joined live and shared some of your summertime with us, you're going to receive a free professional development certificate mailed to you right after the session and be entered into a drawing for 12 free months of ConMigo, our brand new AI guide. Man, to make the most of this session, because you are here live, what we would love for you to do more than anything else is come to the Q&A and do two things. Number one, whatever questions you have about AI and education, no matter how big, no matter how small, no matter how spicy, feel free to put those in right now and throughout the session. And then number two, just as importantly, support your fellow educators by upvoting the ones that you're excited about. For anyone who came to our last session, you know that we took those primarily in the order of upvotes. And so if you've got big, juicy questions, feel free to give that that big plus sign, we will be sure to take those. So with all of that said, let's start with a question that so many people asked in our pre-survey, which is, how do you believe AI is going to actually impact education? So I know this is a little bit crystal ball-like in the sense that we're thinking about where things are headed versus think where things are here in the summer of 2023. But for our panelists, if you want to take that question, if you're excited to dive into it, just go ahead and raise your hand and I will call on you to take it. And Sal, it sounds like you might have something you want to share right off the top. Oh, sure. And obviously none of us have a crystal ball or could predict the future, but in some ways I view, my answer to that question is also the answer how I thought about edtech, even pre-generative AI, which is it's never about somehow, it's never about the technology, it's really about what the pedagogical goals that we all want to do. And I think for time immemorial, well before AI, well before the internet and computers, all educators have always recognized that the goal standard is some form of differentiation. There's a lot of literature and honestly common sense behind mastery learning. If a student hasn't fully mastered a concept, they should always have the opportunity to get their understanding of decimals from an 80% to a 95% because if they don't, they're really going to struggle with algebra when those equations involve decimals. And this is true in pretty much every subject area. And one of the ways that that would have been addressed say 50 years ago is by having a better student-teacher ratios, having a teaching assistants in the room, middle-class, upper middle-class affluent families can afford tutors or maybe sometimes the parents will do the tutoring themselves to provide that level of personalization. Obviously, I'm a fan of the more resources we can throw the students being able to reach their potential the better, but there are some in our control, there are some that aren't in our control. We can't control the student-teacher ratio, we can't control whether or not a student has tutoring at home or whether there's a teaching assistant in the class. If there is all of those things, awesome. So our view at Khan Academy has always been how can we use technology to at least start to approximate some of those things? That's where classic Khan, let's call it, has been, let's give people practice at their own time and pace, initially in math and science. And then we've also started moving the humanities. ELA is not that far away, where someone can learn at their own time and pace, very deep item banks, so that if they haven't learned it, they can keep practicing it. There's space to reputition, spiral review to make sure that they've really gotten to proficiency in mastering things. There's on-demand video and hints so that people can get unstuck hopefully, and that all of that gets reported to the teacher so that they can get better information on how they can work with their students. They don't have to give a one-size-fits-all for every student, that, hey, those 10 students have got it, they can keep working. These 10 students could use a more focused intervention. And then after I'm done with those 10, these five over here could use a different focus intervention. So that's kind of been the vision. I think generative AI just takes that to another level, where now if a student has, the videos aren't doing enough for the student, the exercise hints aren't doing it, the articles, they can ask questions. Sometimes questions they would have been afraid to ask teachers, I get that answer, but in many cases, they might've been willing to ask the teacher, but the teacher can't go to 30 kids who are all asking different questions. The generative AI can act more like a teaching assistant. The best that EdTech could do, pre-generative AI is give you all these dashboards that look like spreadsheets, and you have to kind of think, okay, which kids are struggling and which kids are... And now we're investing in modalities where you can have a conversation with the data, so to speak, and we think that'll make it much, much easier for teachers. And then there's a whole series of workflows, which we hadn't thought about before because we didn't think it was possible, but now you can, where teachers spend a ton of time doing things like writing lesson plans, grading papers, creating rubrics, progress reports, and those are all areas where we think generative AI could substantially save teachers' time. So long answer, all my answers aren't gonna be this long, but I'm hoping in five years, we're in a world where students are feeling much more supported, teachers are feeling much more supported, they have much more time and energy for themselves so they don't burn out, and more time and energy to do kind of the things why I think most teachers went into the profession, kind of more time for those really amazing, engaging moments with students. I'll say one last thing is, I also think the AI being able to have that loop between assignment, rubric, lesson creation, supporting students that say they work on an essay and then being able to report back to a teacher, not only is that going to be really supportive of all of the parties in that mix, but I actually think it can address the chat GPT cheating issue where if you assign an essay and a student, let's say they're doing it on Conmigo and they're doing brainstorming with the AI, the AI's not doing it for them, but it's riffing with them, it's acting as a guide, then the AI can report back to the teacher, say, yeah, as we spend this much time, we did this, we changed our thesis, but eventually got there and based on the rubric, I'd give it an initial 85%, what do you think teacher? You can feel confident that that student didn't cheat, but if the student goes to chat GPT, has that essay generated and just copies and paste that into Conmigo, then Conmigo itself will say, hey, this looks fishy, there's no process here. And I think, honestly, because of bandwidth issues, it was already very expensive and time consuming to grade 30 papers on the same topic and for middle school students. So you definitely never had time to really go into the process, but now we can hopefully streamline that. Love that, thank you for starting us off Sal. Let's go next to Emily over at the Conm World School. Emily, what's your take on where this whole education and AI world is headed? Well, Sal offered a lot of ideas there that are, I'm probably gonna just kind of reiterate those, but definitely see it as a tutoring option to help get at students more individually on an individual level. I'm an English teacher by trade. And so I'm just always thinking about, well, if they want to use AI as a way to generate a first draft, I think the power of writing comes in revision anyway. And so if they're going to learn how to revise, how to make ideas better, how to get rid of very formulaic type writing, that can be very helpful at the high school level. And if they're using it as a tool and not as a method of this is doing my work for me, but teaching them those subtle distinctions about how we use tools to help us, but we are the ones that can then flush that out and really create something better and stronger. And so I think in that way, it's very helpful. And in the same way that Thao also mentioned that it becomes a way to kind of create time, there are shortcuts that are helpful for teachers. You don't always have to write the same email or you don't always have to, you've created a tool that also can save you time. But I also think it can be like that tutor, but the power of a teacher really comes in the relationship and that AI will never circumvent a relationship, right? That will always be there for a teacher. That will always be something that in those moments when you can get at that individual student, which maybe the AI will help you to have more of those individual moments because then those students can be working at a computer and then you can use that time to pull kids aside and to have those one-on-one interactions that are especially valuable and that will create those moments, those really strong teachable moments. So that's my hope. I am taking a very positive and optimistic view of what AI can do for educators. I certainly hope that it doesn't remove educators from the field because education is such a powerful tool, but then again, we have a teacher crisis, at least in Arizona where I live. And so maybe there is more need for that if we're not able to recruit teachers, but that kind of breaks my heart at the same time. So those are some of my thoughts as I think about the power and future of AI. Wow. And then let's go to Madeline for the last sort of answer on this one. We'll come to Malia for the next question because that's juicy as well. Madeline, any thoughts here? Absolutely. So for just a little bit of context, I am an English teacher and the English department chair at Hobart High School. And we do a lot of partnership with early college programs. So we have a lot of students who are juniors, sophomores who are taking college level classes. That's amazing for them and wonderful for them, but we're in a very blue collar town. I have a lot of first-generation college students and a lot of kids who have to work to help their parents pay the rent or the mortgage. And they have practice for their multiple sports on top of that because the competition among students to be able to get into colleges as the cost is getting higher and higher, it's just getting all the more expensive for them. And there's so much fear about not being able to be enough. So one of the areas that I think hasn't been touched on a lot in this conversation so far has been on how is it going to help our students? I guess I am building off of what Sal said a little bit in terms of leveling the playing field. I was looking over my students' conmigo chat history and I was watching the different timeframes in which they were logging in and using it. And many of them were using it after I would have gone to bed, right? Or I would not be available for my students. And I used to feel this paranoia about needing to check my email all the time in my off hours just to make sure that if my kids had a question, God forbid it was the night before the essay was due, but let's all be real. We know our kids, we know that they're gonna do that. But when I'm not reachable, I want to know that they have the ability to get their needs met. So this is a great way to be able to do that. Yeah, I think that's a great call. I think even the world's greatest educator can't be by their students' sides at every single moment, nor should we expect them to. And so to have that resource there in that moment when they need it, that's pretty powerful. Okay, speaking of the power of AI and then also a little bit of the dark side, I've got to tell you, it is overwhelming in the Q&A. The top two questions are from Wendy, how do students use AI without cheating? And from Erica, how best can we detect students using AI inappropriately and then handle those situations? So for our GUS panel, I know we all have different experiences with cheating or with trying to prevent that. Thoughts about how teachers can grapple with this reality. And let's go to Madeline. Because I know Madeline, you've seen this quite a bit and you probably have some strong thoughts here. I have, yeah. So even when we were doing our beta test with Conmigo, actually I did run into this issue a little bit where we'd had conversations about responsible use with our students and they didn't always want to follow those parameters. I think the reality that we have to face with AI is it's a crisis that is not entirely unfamiliar to us. We went through this same thing when Google came out in the field of education. People just concluded like, oh God, no kid is ever gonna have to memorize anything anymore. And what did we have to do? We had to change the way that we assigned content, right? To focus less on rote memorization. And I think we're gonna see that same kind of shift here. So one thing that my district has done, just for context, I've been working with my superintendent a lot and kind of been spearheading our AI initiative in our district. I'm gonna share my screen really quick. Let's see. I want to share this. Okay, so one thing that our district built to help with this issue is we built a rubric. It was based off of Matt Miller and his AI for Educators book. Our mascot is the bricky. I know that won't make sense to a lot of you, but just go with me on this. So we have a rubric that we've made where we have human generated at the bottom and AI generated at the top. And we have descriptors in here for the level to which AI would be allowed to be used. So when each assignment would be given, we would be able to say, okay, kids, this is the level of comfort level we have with you using AI versus human generated content. So, for instance, here, the one that I'm on right now, it talks about using AI to help with brainstorming, but then having to go find sources on their own that address that same subject. And through having access to chat history with ConMigo, that will help a lot in terms of mitigating those concerns. I love that. And Madeline, I will follow up with you afterwards to see if we can borrow that to share with others so that everyone's taking screenshots as you were sharing that. That was so cool. Love it. Let's go next to Kelly. Kelly, what's your take on this question? Yeah, hi, everyone. I think this question always comes up. And I think, personally, we keep doing the same things we always do to prevent cheating, regardless of the source. Kids are gonna cheat if they're gonna cheat. They're gonna find a way. I think, and I love what Madeline just shared because part of what I think is also, it's educating everyone around the student too. Making sure everyone on your teaching team knows how to use these tools and knows about these options. Parents, making sure parents know, perhaps having some informative nights and materials that can go out to families so they know how to work with their children on some of these platforms. So I think it's just new. And I think you do the same thing we always do, like designing assignments to circumvent cheating as well. Making sure there's steps in the process that they have to go through that in the end results in their own thinking there too. And I also love, the thing about something like ConMigo that I like is that back-end data too. So it's not, if you're promoting the use of it, teaching them how to use it, including it in the assignment, perhaps we can be more likely to not control it necessarily, but be able to see later in that data how students are using it too. So I think it's all those things combined with what we're already doing. And right now, the biggest part of it is just making sure we're educating all of our staff and families, and parents and people working with students on how to use it properly. That's awesome. And then finally, let's go to Sal. So I'd love for you to speak to this. And then I would love to dive into math next, because I know that's a hot topic as well. I'll just say a little bit from the technology side of things, anyone who's telling you, and I know there's a lot of folks out there who are claiming that they're creating generative AI writing detectors, the same way that you have plagiarism detectors, anyone who says that to you is selling you snake oil. So be very suspicious of anything else that comes out of that person's mouth. You know, there are ways that you might be able to do it in very basic ways that might detect it in some cases, but we know our students, your students, it's going to be very easy to circumvent that. And I think we should all operate from the assumption that it's essentially undetectable. I think that's the only safe assumption. So the option that we all have is, you know, the non-tech options are, you know, hopefully some type of an honor code could be used in certain cases. In certain cases, I'm sure many of y'all would probably roll your eyes and say, nope, I think it's too tempting when you have something that can write an essay so easily for you. And there's a lot of gray area around like how much help is too much help. The other option is obviously just do more in class. You're not obviously be able to do like very ambitious projects in class, but you'll be able to maybe do some more of that. The other extreme is have more ambitious projects and say, yeah, use whatever you're going to use. I don't think that's appropriate for like kids who are learning to write. That might be appropriate at like late high school or college where they already know how to write and you're making a business or something like that. So I don't think that's a viable option. I think the reality is if we want, which I want, and I think most of y'all want, if we want kids to continue to do the types of research papers, term papers that all of us grew up with, because it did help us think, it did help us learn to write and even just to project manage ourselves and to regulate ourselves and plan something over on our own. I think it's going to have to be in a safe environment where you can keep track of the process. And this is what we're trying to do at ConMigo where the teacher can assign the assignment through the AI and the teacher could decide how much help or no help the AI should do. But then the student has essentially has to do the paper in that type of an environment. So that essentially there's an audit trail of their work. And we can see, oh, it took them this many hours and this was V1 after for one hour, this is V2 after two hours. And I think if students know that there's that audit trail, it becomes much harder for them to just go to chat GPT and generate something and copy and paste it. Very cool. Okay, so now to switch from this idea of how do we deal with the realities of students in the classroom to the realities of math education? I think this is the perfect question for Sal. Peter says, my interest is math. I watched the last ConMigo presentation and was disappointed that use in math was not covered. And that's totally on me, Peter. Definitely, I have a little bias towards the humanities but I'm really excited to remediate that today because Sal of course, got to start with Khan Academy as a math tutor to his own cousin. So what Peter wants to know Sal is what are the use cases for applying ConMigo as a math tutor? We know that these AI tools are so great with verbal skills, so great with writing. What about the math context? What should Peter know? Yeah, and in all fairness, this is still early days where we're trying to put a lot of stuff out there and learn what's working and better or worse. The core idea behind Khan Academy that, and now we have actually a ton of efficacy data behind it. And everyone here is gonna hear more about it but there's 50 plus efficacy studies on Khan Academy before generative AI. And it's all around if students are able to put in, the threshold that have been in these studies is 18 hours a year, it amounts to about 30 to 60 minutes a week and they're able to do personalized practice and different teachers have implemented different ways but the bottom line is they're able to get those two to three 20 minute sessions a week for most of the school year, these kids are dramatically accelerating. They're accelerating depending on the study and the grade level 30, 40, 50, 60%. And so the key question for us is, okay, we have these studies, how do we get more kids to engage and to feel progress at that? I think all educators know, regardless of motivation and engagement is often the key. Even 30 years ago, if you're sufficiently motivated, you could power through a textbook if you really had to but most people didn't work that motivated. And so, on the Khan Academy side, that's why we've always wanted to provide supports like videos, et cetera, et cetera. I think generative AI and what we're trying to do with Khanmigo, we're seeing as another powerful support. I'm curious, well, at places like KWS, we do have Mattie, I know they're not here today, who've been using, I'll tell you what I've been hearing, that it has been able to unblock students where they might have been blocked before. Sometimes it's a block of literally they're confused, they've watched the video, it still doesn't make sense to them, they've read the article, they've looked at the hints, it still doesn't make sense to them. So that helps to have that generative AI. And just so y'all know, we've done a lot above and beyond the core GPT-4 model and chat GPT uses GPT 3.5 or at least the free version does but even GPT-4, which is dramatically better, we've done a lot of work to make it a much, much better at math. And so we've definitely already heard feedback in the first three months, the last three months of last school year when we were piloting it that it is helping students get their questions answered in the moment, oftentimes on exactly that question that they're struggling with or that concept. Sometimes it's a motivational block, like why do I need to learn this? The famous question, the AI can help out with things like that. And so those are, I think, the two clear math use cases. And then beyond that, we do have a general tutor me in STEM or math type of subjects where if a student just has any broad question and I could imagine, and this is kind of something we threw out there, it's a new scope for Khan Academy, which is, if they're working on a particular exercise on Khan Academy or watching a video and they're confused, Khanmigo can show up during those sessions and it has the context of the video. So you can say, I don't understand what Sal meant at this moment and it can answer that. Or wait, this question, I don't understand what this question is asking for, it can do that. The general tutor one, we could imagine that being used when you're even doing your non Khan Academy work, when maybe students are in a project and if they're confused about something, maybe even during a lecture, if they're confused about something right in that moment, they can get an answer to it. We obviously haven't had time to do rich efficacy studies yet, we have done some pretty robust user research to at least make sure that it's not doing harm. So far, the initial indications are it's not doing harm. I think there are a little bit of classroom management issues sometimes because there's so much that you can do with the AI that, okay, don't talk to Abraham Lincoln right now, we have to work on our math. So we're thinking through with educators on how we can control that a little bit better. And we have some early indications that it is indeed helping kids be more engaged in their, at least in their Khan Academy core work and be less unblocked, but that's still a very preliminary news. Very cool. And then let's go next to Malia. Malia. I wanted to focus on something Sal said right there about students being able to kind of like ask in the moment, like even if they're listening to a lecture, even in like a live class session, just to kind of share an antidote from one of my classes this past term, we were talking about the founding fathers and we were, the students were reading a book that was talking a lot about Ben Franklin. And the book was also talking a lot about his sister Jane. And the book was talking about how Ben kind of went from rags to riches and Jane went from rags to rags. And one of my students had the question, is this author biased? Right? Okay, so I want them to discuss that baby. That's a good one, right? I don't wanna like show my hand. So I said, why don't we ask Khan Viggo, right? And so we sat around and we talked about, all right, how would we prompt this, right? How are we gonna get the information that we want? And Khan Viggo was able to play with it. And it knew exactly the passage we were talking about. And then it gave an answer about like, this is the difference between bias and perspective. And all historians have a perspective. And like, what do you think, right? So that was an opportunity for me to de-center myself and let them have the conversation that they were organically having. And so I think that's like a good kind of like in the moment and then again, that modeling of how do we get the types of responses that we want out of this fun tool. Very cool. And then one last thought here, Madeleine, give us your take and then we're gonna go to a live caller if you will, so get ready. I saw someone in the chat also asking, like when is science going to come into the equation as well? So I wanted to bring something up that I know had been helpful for a science teacher who piloted Khan Viggo in my building. She and her students really appreciated the fact that Khan Viggo is great at giving analogies for particular concepts involving like the sciences and involving history. So one of the things that immediately comes to mind for me is the cell wall, right? I was really bad at biology when I was in high school and I didn't have a resource like this. So I went into Khan Viggo and I asked for some analogies for the actual term, make it make sense to me. And it was able to give me like five or six different analogies that made that concept make more sense. And I think the final one that it came up with was like Captain America's shield. And I loved that. So, I was immediately picturing an activity where you could take your vocab list of scientific terms and have Khan Viggo give a bunch of analogies that would help it stick with your kids better. So that's a great way that it would be able to be more than just an answer machine. It's a way to cement knowledge for them. You know, I'll add to that. Cause I, you know, for those of you who don't know my process when I make say science videos, some of them I have the intuition, but a lot of it, you know, I spent a lot of time researching and I don't even want to make a video until I feel like I really have a conceptual understanding of this thing. I've been using Khan Viggo myself, you know, a couple of months ago, I was always curious about, you know, why does supernova, you know, if you're out of fuel in the star, why doesn't it just collapse? Why does it eject material? Conceptually, why does it do that? And I went to Khan Viggo to me in STEM and I mean, it was beautiful. It said, well, do you have any theories why it does that? And I was like, oh, you're asking me. And then I was like, well, huh, you know, and it made me think, and I'm like, well, I don't know. Is it like a rebound? Is it like, you know, and then they're like, yeah, you're kind of, he goes like, yeah, you're on the right track because the collapse is, there's a lot of pressure and it's so dramatic. Like, you know, have you ever seen a, some, anything drop from a high height that doesn't bounce? Like, I'm like, oh, good point. And like, so it's, yes, it's that the, that the bouncy jacks some of the stuff on the, and I never understood that. And this is, you know, this is something I've always been interested in. I've even asked experts and they never quite gave it to me or sometimes they gave me an explanation without making me think it through myself. So yeah, I actually think science is one of the areas. Cause so much of science, if we want, and I think we all want the kids to go beyond memorizing the formulas or memorizing the terms. So much of science is making sure you understand it conceptually. And you know, we've gone on great pains over the years at Khan Academy to hopefully do that through videos and articles, but you know, different metaphors, different visualizations are going to connect for different folks. And I think this is where it's really powerful. I love that. Definitely so much creativity baked in here. Let's do, speaking of creativity, let's do something a little crazy. We never actually tried here at Khan Academy before. Let's do some live call-in. And I know live talk radio and ed tech don't always go together. Let's give it a shot in the interest of innovation. So Sandhya, I know you've had your hand up for awhile. Thank you for your patience. I'll give you a chance to unmute your line. Feel free to come on Sandhya if you can. Ask your question. I'm so excited. I've never done this before either. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. So I'm a math teacher. I teach seventh grade math and I went back this year after 13 years. The math teacher quit in the middle of the year at my daughter's school and they asked me to fill in. So I'm, my learning curve is extremely steep. Coming back after 13 years and then with all these tools. And I've spent the whole summer studying AI. And I was looking at the question that we had asked in the conmigo about the frat, the help with multiplying two fractions. And the response that came back was basically multiply the numerator and the denominator is AI or conmigo able to go into more, I think, Sal you were talking about conceptual understanding that, well, why are we multiplying the numerator and denominator? Or are they just going to get the steps? Great question. Simple answer is it should be able to do that. Like it, it, it, like we could even demo it right now live. It would say like, why, why do you multiply the number and denominator? Can you explain that? Yeah, absolutely. You want to see what it does, Jeremy? Like for example, this year I was teaching the kids, like why do we, when we divide decimals, why do we flip it and multiply? And the reality is you don't have to, right? The re all the kids are like, seriously, you don't have to. I'm like, it's to make your life simpler. That's why you do it, you know? And I just don't, I want as we're building thinking classrooms, that's really what we need to do is teach the children how to think. And if they don't understand why they're doing the steps, even with AI, it's not going to help them become thinkers. Yeah. And I like the way that sort of conmigo again, reframed it through the kid's lens of not, we just do it because that's the way we've always done it, but it sort of puts it in this sort of pizza frame, if you will, I think it'd be more effective. Yeah. And, you know, the one you just gave it, Jeremy, like we didn't give it the context of the, that's right. Why do, yeah, we probably should ask when we multiply fractions, why do we multiply numerators and denominators? Clear the chat and then ask it. You'll probably give it when we multiply. And this is a tip because then people are asking like, what's the best way to use AI? And one thing that's for both for your students and for your own use, whether you use conmigo or chat GPT or whatever, always think about that sort of classic idea of garbage in garbage out. If you just ask something really generic, like how do you do this thing? It may not have enough context to go on, but if you explain what's going on, what you're trying to achieve, it can be a lot more effective. So when you say when we multiply fractions, why do we multiply the numerator and denominator? Are the numerators and denominators? Imagine you have half a pizza and you want to share it with a friend. How much does each pizza get? And yeah, you could say, let's go forth. That's right. Let's try a fourth. And this is great. This is live TV, everyone. This is not pre-recorded. Yeah, this has not been planned. That's great. Sandhya, can you confirm that we are meeting for the first time right now? Yeah, we are meeting for the first time and I'm loving this because I love how it's going back and asking the question back. That's right. Yeah, so I mean, we could keep going with this, but yes, it is actually, I've actually, the places where generative hay historically struggles the most is actually on just doing the math. And we've gone through great pains to make that a lot better than you would get it before. But on the conceptual, it's quite strong, which is still kind of amazing to me. So how do we use Klonmigo? We have to get permission, I'm assuming through our IT department or at school or can I just use it on my own or how does that generally work? Jeremy and I are working very hard to make that answer simpler over time. So unfortunately it's a little bit complicated right now. There's a couple of ways, there's gonna be a group of districts. So there's ways to go through the district that we're talking to school districts for this coming back to school already. There's also gonna be ways, or there is a way that a parent or a teacher can sign up for an individual account. And Jeremy knows more about that. I will say, and this is, our mission as a nonprofit is free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. And obviously it always costs money to build Klon Academy, our budget is about 70 million a year. But the reason why we've been able to, it's funded with philanthropy primarily and then the marginal cost, incremental cost of serving up the pages or the videos, it's low enough that we can do it for free, for the most part. Generative AI, like every one of those interactions that we just did was literally going to like hundreds, if not thousands of like state of the art, like Nvidia chips. And so we get charged a lot right now. And so we are essentially just charging folks for that cost. So it's passing through us to essentially go to folks like OpenAI and Microsoft and Nvidia, so that we can do it. So that's currently, it costs about $9 a month is where we are. So, and there's different permutations, but that's where it is today. But we're working pretty hard to see if we can get the cost down and if we can make it easier for people to just sign up and sign up for students. Cool, great question Sandhya. You have restored our faith in the talk. Jeremy, what would you recommend? Because Jeremy, beyond running awesome webinars like this is also in charge of trying to get what we call grassroots users, like so people who aren't doing it through the district to how they use Khan Academy and Khanmigo in particular. What is the easiest way that you would say if a teacher wants to use it? Jeremy. Oh, sorry, my apologies. Yeah, so the link that I shared in the chat is the easiest way to get access and similar to like Netflix or something like that. You know, you just sort of sign up. That being said, as Sal mentioned, we're always trying to find ways to make it even more affordable, more accessible. So look for developments with that in the near future. And I will just say, I didn't know if that was question was for Sandhya. Sandhya, if you have ideas for how we can get into more teacher's hands, more parents hands, please let me know when I send you that PD certificate at the end and I'll be putting a gold star on it because you rock with Sandhya. Will do, will do. And I'm wondering, just sorry, I don't want to monopolize, but one more question. Because my daughter and my school, we required kids to do Khan Academy all summer to close the gap. And my daughter had 133 assignments to do. Is there, do you see the future of like when they're watching the videos or doing their practice questions and they're being like a collaboration with Khan Meego where if they're stuck on that practice question and can be more interactive with whatever's, what they're learning and their skill-based learning videos in practice? Yeah, that's already, I mean, there's a large degree that already exists. When Khan Meego gets turned on, anytime someone's doing anything on Khan Academy, Khan Meego can assist them, answer questions, quiz them about it, connect it to other things, et cetera. Oh, that's awesome. The demonstration. Thank you. Yeah, Khan Meego will always be that sort of guide on the side as we say. Yeah, watch that video on intro to fractions. Yeah. And, and then ask a question. You're in teacher mode right now. Ah, yeah. That's why it's saying write a lesson plan and things like that. So I mean, you could say, write a poem about this video. Right. This is, it's actually a pretty good summary when it does a poem. A square, a rectangle and a pie all cut up. Oh, oh my, oh wait, I missed that. You scroll up a little bit Jeremy. Oh, oops. All right. So yeah, definitely lots of use cases. Oh, let me, wait. Oh, sorry about that sound. Lots of use cases from the sort of teacher dashboard all the way to the student experience. Sonya, you've been amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you. Lots more of these. But for now, let me actually go to a question that's been waiting very patiently in the wings in the Q and A. And actually speaks to sort of two different variants here. First Scott says, the internet enabled data retrieval. Online tools enabled self-learning. AI enhances both and brings new capabilities. Given all this, how much class time should teachers spend demonstrating the best and most ethical practices when you use these resources? So in other words, should we be really diving deep here or just providing some general guidelines? And then Laura asks a complimentary question, which is how can I teach my ninth graders how to use AI effectively? So we've kind of gone past that plagiarism and cheating issue to, okay, this is the reality of 2023. How do we make the most of it? Any thoughts from our amazing panelists? Let's go to Malia. The number one thing that I've stressed in the classroom is that this is an opportunity for us to all learn together, right? Like this just came out. It's new to all of us. It's new to you, it's new to me. And so being curious and like being a role model for them saying like, I'm trying to figure out how to use it ethically. I'm trying to figure out how to use it creatively. Like it's a tool to like do the thing with our students, which I think is powerful. And to say to them, you know, as I have before, sometimes I'll say like, well, this is how I'm prompting it. How are you prompting it, right? And to let their voices feel empowered. Well, definitely. Let's go to Madeline. So kind of two things in response to that on the responsible use front. This is exactly what I was just talking about. Earlier today, I was with our students who are getting trained as writing center tutors. And I had a lot of them as students last year and one of them got pretty vulnerable. And she said, Ms. Bartsch, I was so scared to use AI because I didn't want to be doing something wrong. And I think what we really need to internalize is because the primary discourse right now is chat GPT is an answer machine. Chat GPT is, you know, causing a cheating outbreak. There are a lot of kids who are genuinely fearful that by using it, they're doing something wrong. So by giving them that kind of rubric, like the one that I showed you where, you know, we're setting the tone of, hey, this is what we're permitting and giving them the chance to play with it, that's how you switch the narrative is through giving them that exposure and through giving them that opportunity to try. And then that's how they're gonna get more comfortable and also get better at asking it the right questions. The other thing that I brought up to them is we would be doing a disservice to them if we didn't give them that exposure, right? Because the world that they're going into is going to be increasingly AI based or AI integrated. And so if we continued to shield them entirely from it, we'd be causing a problem. I think having those structured activities where they can play but play responsibly is very, very critical. So for instance, for an essay that I was doing with my students, I let them brainstorm, make outlines using conmigo. A lot of my students struggle with counter arguments. I said, if you wanna debate with conmigo and find a counter argument, go for it. In the last webinar, I actually shared a story about how one of my students wanted to write a paper on the likelihood of future nuclear warfare, which I know nothing about. What was I going to be able to do to help Jimmy with that paper, right? But he was, I literally have read through hours of chat history of his this summer, just amazed at the kinds of questions that he was able to ask because he was given permission to do so. So they do need that freedom a little bit. I love that Madeline. So much better to face the world that's coming than to stick our heads in the sand. I gotta tell you, listening to you speak Madeline, I'm getting ready to move my family to Hobart Indiana because I want you teaching my kids. Okay, I think we're gonna roll the dice again a little bit here and do another caller. So Cherie Nelson, if you are a game fort, we're gonna give you the opportunity to turn on your microphone and feel free to join us on KSA-L, chat with Sal. Hi, I'm Dr. Cherie Nelson. I teach economics at Purdue Global University. And I am the course lead for microeconomics and macroeconomics, so I design the courses. And unlike some universities, what course I design, every macro and micro teacher uses. So it's not just for me. So that being said, what's been really interesting is that I have integrated Khan Academy videos into my courses before, and now I'm just doing it even more. It's just great. But with, I'll be honest, I don't know much about Khanmigo, but I have been using chat GPT to even generate my own discussion board prompts. And so I tell my students, I'm using it, it's okay. And in fact, Purdue Global had a school-wide meeting with all of the faculty encouraging them to use AI, but do it responsibly so that we can learn to do it and teach our students to take advantage of it. So what I was wondering is, and I know I took all that time explaining everything, but I hope I gave you a pretty good premise. Remember, context is key in the world of AI. Yeah, well, and also I'm doing things now that other course leads haven't done yet and I want to teach them how to do, because we're a huge university and we have a lot of opportunity. So what I do in my classes, I actually do approach with the SAIL Khan approach. And that is, I tell my students, if you don't have the foundation, because I've watched an interview with SAIL, where you talk to SAIL about the, if you don't have the foundation and you're moving forward, basically the analogy I give to my students is, if you don't have a good base in your house, the rest that's built upon it might fall down. And that's, I learned from SAIL and so I share that. So I was wondering with, and here's my question, it took me forever to get to that, just be glad I'm not your professor. So I was wondering, is there a way or is it already done that something is built in with the Khanmigo, where when you type something in, it gives you the information you're looking for, but it also directs you or asks you, by the way, did you know the, and then ask a question about a concept that is before that, like a foundational thing. And- I can take a straight stab at answering that. And actually I'll try to do a little bit of a show and tell me if I can share a window and see- You can't make me think of that. So this, I'm looking at an extra, this is a video on Khan Academy on price elasticity of supply, and then I could go to Khanmigo and says, can you quiz me to make a video and make sure I am ready to understand what is in this video? That's what you were asking, I'm sure you like that, like the prerequisite knowledge. Well, yeah, yeah, that's on track. Do they know to ask that question though? Yeah, so that's, so you're right. So the, so I think there's two layers is that what you're describing can already be done if someone knows to do it, which as you know, most people, now it could happen through the teacher could, and we're all in this together. I like the previous answer around like, we're all learning how AI is going to be used. Absolutely, yes. But I think it could be a cool practice when teachers are having students watch a Khan Academy video or Khan Academy exercise. If the student immediately jumps into it and they're able to engage, great. But maybe if there's already a sense that they might struggle, like, hey, why don't you start with a quiz to make sure you're refreshed on the prerequisite knowledge. That's one way. If that seems to be something that works, then yeah, we would think about productizing that, or, let me clear this chat. Let me make this a little bit bigger. I think my, you know, we have these choices of things that we think a lot of people might ask, and obviously you can type whatever you want, but maybe that's something we can add to this. Help me prep with a quiz right now that'll just quiz you on the content of this. There could be another one just like that we add that says, make sure I'm ready for this video or make sure I'm ready for this exercise or something like that. I think that that's awesome. And what I was, what made me think of that is, I just currently, I'm just finishing up the revision of my microeconomics course, and I'm using the new, and I'm not into like promoting a publisher at this time, but I will, sorry, I won't mention which one, but I am with the new publisher who has so many, third-party tools for my students, and they have it so that when you're in the book and you're reading a concept, it will, it has the icon that says, do you need a little more practice with this? Would you like more background? Things like that, because sometimes if they're just looking at one concept, they don't know what concepts they're missing. Right. I love that. And so if we had the suggestions there, oh, I'm sorry, Sal. No, no, I agree. I actually love this. We're gonna take this as a bright like, would you like more background? Obviously Khan Academy, we've always had the exercise piece. So like in theory, you could practice what you learned, but this idea of would you like more background for it, I think is a really powerful idea. Is it okay if we borrowed that idea, Shari? Well, you know what? I have no problem with that. And in fact, the new publisher that I'm working with has also through this process has said, we might hire you for to be a content contributor. Aha, there you go. Because I have all these, I've been teaching online. I've been with Purdue Global. I'll have my 20 year anniversary in October. So I have a lot of online experience. And I'll tell you, I'm always looking to see how we can do it better. Oh, cool. Cause you can never stop improving. That's right. Thank you so much Shari, you were fantastic. Thank you so much. All right, so I think this is the great thing about like where Khan Amigo has headed, where AI has headed. We all get a chance to write this story, just like our awesome panel has been talking about. Let's get our educators involved. Let's get our students involved. We should all be driving this forward if this is gonna be a big thing for our future. Now that being said, we're coming to our final 10 minutes. And so I wanna end with those sort of proverbial fireworks, a chance for the panel to show off some of their best AI skills. And so I wanna tackle these two twin questions. Maria says, how do I best use AI? Period. Scott says, how can we make this a powerful tool? And so I'm curious from Emily, Kelly, Sal, Madeline, and Malia, are there any amazing pro tips that you pioneers at the Vanguard of this movement can share with educators across the country? Let's go over to Madeline. Sorry if I'm doing some monopolizing. I love all of these questions. And like I said, I was just talking about this yesterday with the staff at my building. I think one of the most powerful ways that Khan Amigo has helped me as an educator is through, it was something that Sal touched on earlier, expediting certain tasks so I can use my time more effectively to work on relationships with my students. One of the things that all English teachers hate making more than anything in the world is a rubric, right? Mostly because I think we are some of the most critical of our own writing, even in those nitty gritty tasks. So to make a really good rubric that takes a lot of time, I've got some slides here, let me scroll to them super quick and then I'll share my screen, that I modeled for my colleagues about how you can use Khan Amigo to make an effective rubric in way less time than it used to take, just in terms of effectiveness of your plan period. So I had first told Khan Amigo, hey, I'm trying to work on making a rubric that assesses a summative for my English nine honors students. It gave its own suggestions for categories, but I said I wanted to make my own that were based off of my curriculum map. So then I made my own criteria and kind of explained what I thought those would look like. And then Khan Amigo asked how many levels I would want for those criteria. I changed the number of levels that it suggested. And then after 15 minutes of that back and forth, and then some formatting time, this is the rubric I was able to make. Oh. I did some tweaking of the phrasing, a rubric like that, just to give you an idea would normally take me about 50 minutes, which is almost that entire plan period to do. And I was able to get so many other activities done for my classroom in that extra time, because I didn't have to worry so hard about finding that exact phrasing for something that really doesn't, I don't wanna say it doesn't deserve that amount of my attention and energy, but there are so many other areas that I would rather be spending that energy in. I wanna be giving my students quality feedback on their own writing, not spending that time drafting a rubric myself. I love that Madeline, like calling out, hey, if you've got tedious parts of your job, and don't we all, there's probably a good chance that AI can take on some of that. And then B, don't treat AI like Google, if we have for the last 20 years, we just put in a question and settle for the answer, continue to push it. Think of it as a dialogue with it Madeline did, and get better and better outputs. Thanks for sharing that Madeline. Let's go to Kelly. Hi, yeah, so my experiences so far with it have been similar to Madeline's as far as proficiencies, and both, I'll talk a little bit about how some of my students have used it too, but I wrote in the chat earlier, when our Purdue professor was talking about using it to design some work, I've also used it to design an online art history class that was brand new, kind of under a time crunch. I was like, okay, we gotta get some creative assignments here. It'd been a little while since I put together some new things like that on my own. So I used Conmigo to help create some projects. And at Con World School, we do some cross-disciplinary work. So I even asked some questions like, I'd love to get some novel suggestions that would also work with this art history unit, you know, some of this African art unit I'm working on, and I kind of went back and forth with it in a little while and came up with a good interdisciplinary project with English where they read things all apart, and it goes along with some of the art history unit or something like that. So that was just one example where it saved me a ton of time where I think if I was just kind of sitting in front of my screen pondering, not myself, I just would have gone back and forth maybe even walked away before finishing what I was trying to do. So I had a few handful of assignments that that really saved me a ton of time. And then with our students, we have a seminar at Con World School where we go over different topics every week. And sometimes we do debates or arguments too. And I had a student that used it to flesh out her argument, kind of asked it to poke holes in it or went back and forth with different perspectives. And she said it really prepared her for the following day where she could have done that with me, but with all your students, do you have time to do that with all of your students? And probably not. And for us, she was also in a time zone that was nine hours ahead of me. So the chance for us to get together before our next session probably wouldn't have happened. So she was able to do that online and I loved that. So she felt so much more prepared the next day. Oh, cool. So clearly it's not just the tedious stuff, it's also the most important stuff, whether it's designing a brand new curriculum or helping students sort of grapple with complex ideas. That's pretty powerful. Let's go next to Emily. I was just gonna add, I also work at Con World School. And I think the power in helping students to ask questions is really at the crux of what you can do with Con Academy. I want my students to be curious. I want my students to ask questions and I can't be there all the time to be at the sounding board, to go back and forth, but Con Migo can be that. And whether they're talking about an important world topic or a history topic, or they're working on an English essay, they have that as a constant sounding board. Now, I would love to be that starter to like kind of work them through modeling, asking questions, because I don't necessarily want questions that are instant recall kinds of responses. But if they wanna ask questions about a novel and if they wanna ask questions, I know Sal has included our student, Sonvi, in a number of talks where she discussed Great Gatsby and looking at the green light and had a conversation with Con Migo about that. Those are powerful interactions. The simulation of Jay Gatsby. Oh, yes, yes. Realization. And that curiosity, now Sonvi, she is a very unique student. She is incredibly curious and I wish all of my students were as curious as she is, but teaching them that curiosity, teaching them to ask questions and what a powerful tool Con Migo can be to ask questions and initiate a sort of simulated conversation. Yes, love that. I'm gonna show a little demo as we switch to our final panelist, Malia, take us home. What tips do you have for educators out there? Most practical thing that all of my colleagues have said is outsource the busy work, right? The stuff that the AI is good at, it is good at, let it do that and spend your time with your students. And then I also just, well, I'll stop there, Jeremy. Okay, no, I love that. I love that. And then it actually gives us two minutes, which is perfect. I wanna have Sal close us off. Sal, you came to me in the fall last year and said, Jeremy, there's this thing that's coming out that could change everything. And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, Sal, who knows? People in Silicon Valley say all sorts of crazy stuff, but now it's a reality. Now it is part of our lives. What words of wisdom do you have for educators across the country as they finish up this beautiful summer and then get ready to take on the first fall with AI intact? Yeah, I'll say kind of what we've been trying to tell ourselves at Khan Academy, because some of this stuff is very exciting, but it also be intimidating. It's a little bit scary. There's a lot of edge cases that none of us know what to deal with. And the solution isn't to hide from it. The solution is to try to engage with it. And there's all these debates about whether AI is gonna be good for humanity or bad for humanity. And what I've been telling people is like, I don't think it's a flip of a coin. I actually think it's going to depend on whether good people with good intent are jumping in and trying to make good use of it. Cause we know the bad people with bad intent are already jumping in and trying to make bad use of it. So I think it's actually really important for all of us. Hopefully everyone here is good people with good use cases who want to do good by humanity. To jump in, learn it ourselves. Don't, you know, this is one of those moments where no one is an expert and everyone can be an expert. If you have played with Conmigo or chat GPT for an hour, you are already in like the top 10% of humanity. You're already an expert. So this is a moment where people should jump in, but also don't judge all of generative AI based on chat GPT, which is not designed for this. And it's in any way, shape or form, but give tools like Conmigo a shot if we can hopefully get the access, start playing with it, seeing how you use it with your students, give us feedback, cause we are very serious about, we didn't talk about all the guardrails about keeping it safe. We talked a little bit about the transcripting and the second AI that actively notifies parents and teachers if something is amiss. Obviously we're thinking a lot about cheating and things like that. But yeah, jump into it. I think number one, if you, just as was just said, if you start using it to start saving you from some of your work that you, it's not your favorite thing to write rubrics or whatever, you're gonna start being an expert. And then if you start having your students start to use it for even light cases, you're gonna start learning a lot. And we're all, you're gonna learn a lot. Not, we're all relatively new to this space, but it's all about leaning into it and thinking about it boldly, but responsibly. I love that. And I'll just end with the words that I always told my kindergarten students, which is if you wanna learn something the best way, don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. So I think this is a chance for us all to build something really awesome together. So here's wishing you all a beautiful rest of the summer a great start to the new year. And we'd love to be part of that journey as well. Here's wishing you many exciting adventures. Here's everyone.
