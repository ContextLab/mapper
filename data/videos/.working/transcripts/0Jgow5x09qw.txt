We have nine balls right over here, and we're going to assume that they look completely identical, but one of the balls is slightly heavier than the other eight. And you can't tell just by feeling it. It's very slightly heavier. You would need some type of an instrument to tell whether the ball, one ball, is heavier than another ball. And the only instrument that you have at your disposal is this scale right over here. And so my question is, using this scale, what is the minimum number of times that you need to use it in order to figure out which of these nine balls is the heavy ball? And so I encourage you to pause this video and think about it as long as necessary to think about what is the minimum times that you need to use this scale. And then when you unpause, I will give you a few hints. So I'm assuming you've given a try at it, and maybe you've been able to do it in three wings or using the scale. But I will now tell you that it is possible to do it in two wings. So if you didn't figure out a way to do it in two wings, I encourage you to pause the video again and try to figure out a way to do it in two wings. So once again, I assume you've given a go at it for the two wings. And now I will give you a hint. You might have figured it out, in which case, congratulations. But in case you didn't figure out, I'll give you a hint. Each time you use the scale, you can rule out 2 thirds of the balls. So think about that. The first time you use it, you can rule out 2 thirds of the balls. So you'll have three left. And the second time you use it, you could rule out 2 thirds of the three left. And you'll have one ball left, which you know will be the heavier ball. So if that gets you excited that now you can solve it, once again, pause the video and try to solve the problem. So I'm assuming you had a go at it. And maybe you solved it. Maybe you haven't. But now let's work through it together. And just like I said, in each wing, we figure that we can rule out 2 thirds of the balls. So how do we do that? Well, step one, let's weigh three balls versus three balls. So let's say you take this group right over here. And you put it on that side of the scale. And then you take this group right over here, these three right over here. And you put it on that side of the scale. So how does that help us? Well, there's two possible outcomes over here. One possible outcome is that you have balance, that they are the same. And then the other outcome is that one side is heavier. One side is heavier. So what can you deduce if they are the same? Well, if they are the same, then you know that this group must have the heavy ball. So if you know that this group has the heavy ball, then what you do is out of this group, you put one of the balls on that side. So let me put it this way. Then you weigh other group. And you do that by doing one versus one. And then those are either going to be the same. And if they are the same, say these two are the ones you weigh and they are the same, then you know that this one must be the heavier one. So then that one, then you know the other is heavier. Now, if you weigh one versus one, let's say this one is heavier than this one, then you know that this is the heavy ball. Or if you know that this is heavier than this, then you know that this is the heavy ball. So otherwise, you obviously know the heavy ball. Whichever one goes down is heavier. Heavy, heavy ball. And you follow the same logic right over here. If when you weighed this group of three compared to this group of three, and you saw that one side is heavier, then you do the same exercise with the heavier side. So let's say you determine that this side is heavier. Then out of this side, you do one versus one. So you may put that there and then that there. So then you do one versus one from the heavy side. And it's the same logic. If these two are the same, then this is going to be the heavy ball. If one of these goes down and the other one goes up, then you know that that's the heavy ball. So if it's the same, then you get the other one that you didn't weigh is heavy, is the heavy ball. And if one of them goes down, you know that's the heavy ball. No heavy, you know it's the heavy ball. And so this is just a general principle in general. You sometimes think, oh, if I can only weigh two things at a time, how can I rule out two thirds? Well, I've just told you. And you can use this principle so you can imagine how many weighings would it take if you had 27 balls? And actually, I think that's an interesting thing to think about. And sometimes, this is actually something that shows up in a lot of interview questions. Sometimes they won't give you a group of nine. They'll give you a group of eight. So let's say there was only eight balls and one was heavier. And they tend to do that, at least my theory of why they do that is because it's a little bit less obvious that you would break it up into thirds then. But you could do the exact same thing. So I encourage you to think about two things. How many wings would it take if you had 27 balls, one of which is heavier? And how would you do it if you had a situation where you only had eight balls? And from that, you can devise all sorts of neat, derivative brain teasers from this one.
