So let's say that we have y is equal to the secant of three pi over two minus x. And what we wanna do is we wanna figure out what dy dx is, the derivative of y with respect to x is, at x equal pi over four. And like always, pause this video and see if you could figure it out. Well as you can see here, we have a composite function. We're taking the secant not just of x, but you could view this as of another expression that I guess you could define, or as of another function. So for example, if we call this right over here u of x, let's do that. So if we say u of x is equal to three pi over two minus x, and we could also figure out u prime of x is going to be equal to derivative of three pi over two, that's just going to be zero, derivative of minus x, well that's just going to be minus one, and you could just view that as a power rule. It's one times negative one times x to the zero power, which is just one. So there you go. So we could view this as the derivative of secant with respect to u of x, and when we take the derivative, the derivative of secant with respect to u of x times the derivative of u with respect to x. And you might say, well what about the derivative of secant? Well in other videos we actually prove it out, and you could actually re-derive it. Secant is just one over cosine of x, so it comes straight out of the chain rule. So in other videos we prove that the derivative of the secant of x, of secant of x is equal to, is equal to sine of x over cosine of x, over cosine of x squared. So if we're trying to find the derivative of y with respect to x, well it's going to be the derivative of secant with respect to u of x times the derivative of u with respect to x. So let's do that. The derivative of secant with respect to u of x, well instead of seeing an x everywhere, you're gonna see a u of x everywhere. So this is going to be sine of u of x, sine of u of x, and I could, I don't have to write u of x, I could write three pi over two minus x, but I'll write u of x right over here just to really visualize what we're doing. So sine of u of x over, over cosine squared of u of x. Cosine squared, let me do those parentheses in the blue color just to make sure that you identify it with the trig function. So cosine squared of u of x, u of x. So that's the derivative of secant with respect to u of x, and then the chain rule tells us it's gonna be that times u prime, u prime of x. So what is this going to be equal to? Well I could just substitute back. This is going to be equal to, I will write it like this, sine of u of x, which is three pi over two minus x, and I'll fill that in a second, over cosine of u of x squared times u prime of x. U of x is three pi over two minus x, three pi over two minus x, and then u prime of x, we already figured out is negative one. So I could write times negative one, oh yeah, let me just leave it out there for now. I could have just put a negative out front, but I really want you to be able to see what I'm doing here. And now we want to evaluate at x equals pi over four. When that is equal to pi over four, pi over four, so let's see, this is going to be, this is going to be equal to sine of, what's three pi over two minus pi over four? I'll do that over here. So if you have a common denominator that is six pi over four, the same thing as three pi over two, minus pi over four, sorry, minus pi over four, is equal to five, five pi over four. So it's sine of five pi over four, five pi over four, over cosine squared of five pi over four, and then times negative one, I could just put that out here. Now what is sine of five pi over four and cosine squared of five pi over four? Well, I don't have that memorized, but let's actually draw a unit circle and we should be able to, we should be able to figure out what that is. So a unit circle, I'm gonna try to hand draw it as best as I can. Please forgive me that this circle does not look really like a circle. Okay, so let me just remember my angles. So I, in my brain, I sometimes convert into degrees. Pi over four is 45 degrees. This is pi over two, this is three pi over four, this is four pi over four, this is five pi over four, lands you right over there. So if you wanted to see where you intersect the unit circle, this is at the point, this is at the point, your x coordinate is negative square root of two over two, negative square root of two over two, and your y coordinate is negative square root of two over two. If you're wondering how I got that, I encourage you to review the unit circle and some of the standard angles around the unit circle. You'll see that in the trigonometry section of Khan Academy. But this is enough for us because the sine is the y coordinate, it's the y coordinate here, so negative square root of two over two. So this is negative square root of two over two. And then the cosine is the x coordinate, which is also negative square root of two over two, but it's gonna be that squared. Negative square root of two over two, we're squaring it. So if we square this, it's gonna become, this is going to become positive, and then square root of two squared is two, and then two squared is four. So it's one half. So this is, the denominator is equal to one half. The numerator, this negative cancels out with that negative. And so we are left with, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll, that we are left with square root of two over two, that's the numerator, divided by one half. Well, that's the same thing as multiplying by two. So we are left with positive square root of two is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of y is equal to this when x is equal to pi over four. Pretty exciting.
