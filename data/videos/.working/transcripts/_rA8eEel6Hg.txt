We're told a pizza place makes seven pizzas. Each pizza is cut into eight slices. How many slices of pizza are there in total? Pause this video and try to figure that out. All right, now let's work through this together. So let's just imagine each of those pizzas and each of them are gonna cut into eight slices and we have seven of them. So we could think about it like this. So if you could imagine each circle here is one of those pizzas and each of those pizzas are split into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight slices. So eight slices and there's seven of those pizzas. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So if you wanna know the total number of slices, you're essentially going to add these seven eighths together. Well, adding seven eighths is the same thing as multiplying eight by seven or seven by eight. Now, another way to think about it is you could think about each of those pizzas generating seven slices or actually each of those pizzas generating eight slices, that is kind of eight slices and there's seven pizzas. This is the first pizza, gets these eight slices, second pizza, these eight slices, all the way to the seventh pizza. Now, how many total slices there are? Well, again, we see we have seven rows of eight. So we would just add all of these eights together, which is again, the same thing as seven times eight or eight times seven, which if you were to add them all up or you might already know is equal to 56.
