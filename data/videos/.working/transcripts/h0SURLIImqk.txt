Find the slope of a line perpendicular to the line 3x plus 2y is equal to 6. Now just as a bit of a review, let's just think about two lines that are perpendicular. So that's my x-axis, this is my y-axis, my y-axis. And let's say I have one line over here, just like that. And let's say that it has a slope. Let's say that the slope over here for this line is equal to m. Now let's have a line that's perpendicular to that line. So that means it intersects at a 90 degree angle. So let's say this line right here is perpendicular, so this right here is a 90 degree angle. Then if this purple line has a slope of m, then this green line will have a slope of negative 1 over m. It is the negative reciprocal, or the negative inverse of the slope of the magenta line. And this is obviously the negative inverse of the green line. Their slopes are the negative inverse of each other, and that's what makes them perpendicular. And I won't prove it in this video. But let's just apply that to this right over here. So we have a line, 3x plus 2y is equal to 6. If we figure out this line's slope, then the slope of a line that's perpendicular to it will be the negative reciprocal of that slope. So let's find this guy's slope, and then the negative reciprocal of that will be the slope of a line that's perpendicular to it. So we have, let me switch to pink, 3x plus 2y is equal to 6. The easiest way to find the slope is to put this equation in slope intercept form, where y is equal to mx plus b form. So we want to solve for y. Let's subtract 3x from both sides. So we subtract 3x from both sides. And so the left-hand side, we're just left with 2y. And on the right, we're left with, we could write this as 6 minus 3x, or negative 3x plus 6. Now we can divide both sides of this equation by 2. So divide by 2, divide by 2, divide by 2. The left-hand side, we just have a y is equal to negative 3 halves x plus 6 over 2 is 3. So the slope of this line, we now wrote it in slope intercept form. This right here is our slope. This right here is our m. The slope of this line is negative 3 halves. M is equal to negative 3 halves. So the slope of a line that's perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of this. So if we take, let me write it down. So slope of perpendicular line is going to be the negative reciprocal. So this is a negative number already. If we take the negative of that, it's going to become a positive number. And then we have the reciprocal. Instead of 3 halves, we will have 2 thirds. So there are different signs, and this is the reciprocal of that. And we are done.
