The graph of the function g is shown below. What is the input value for which g of x is equal to negative two? So what they do over here is along the x axis, these are the inputs, and then the graph shows us what's the output. So when x is equal to seven, g of seven we see here is one. If x equals nine, g of nine here is two. If x equals six, g of six is equal to the y-coordinate, at this point, is equal to zero. So what is the input value for which g of x is equal to negative two? Well this graph right over here, this is y equals g of x. So g of x equaling negative two means y is equal to negative two. And so when does y equal negative two? Well when does y equal negative two? It looks like that happens right at this point and that happens when you input negative nine into g. G of negative nine is negative two. So this is going to be negative nine. And we're done.
