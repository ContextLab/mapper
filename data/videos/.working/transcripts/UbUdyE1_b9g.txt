We're asked to subtract and simplify the answer. We have 8 18's minus 5 18's. So subtracting fractions is very similar to adding fractions. If we have the same denominator, the denominator and the difference is going to be the same as the denominators in the two numbers that we're subtracting. So it's going to be 18. And our numerator is going to be the difference between the numerator. So in this case, it is 8 minus 5. And this will be equal to 3 over 18, which is the answer. But it's not completely simplified because both 3 and 18 are divisible by 3. So let's divide them both by 3. So you divide 3 by 3. You divide 18 by 3. And you get 3 divided by 3 is 1. 18 divided by 3 is 6. So you get 1 sixth. And just to see this visually, let me draw 18 parts. So let me draw 18 parts here. So it might be a little bit of a messy drawing. Try the best I can. So let me draw 6 in this direction. So that is 3 right there. We have another 3. So that's 6 parts. And then let me split this into 3 columns. So there we go. We have 18 parts. Now 8 over 18 is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. That's 8 over 18. And now we want to subtract 5 of the 18ths. So we subtract 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now what do we have left over? Well, we have 3 of the 18ths left over. So you have that right there. You have 3 of the 18ths left over. Now, if you turn 3 of the 18ths into 1 piece, how many of those bigger pieces do you have? This is one of those big pieces. Where are the other ones? Well, this is another big piece right here. Another one, another one, and another one. If you had 18 pieces and you merged 3 of the pieces into 1, then you actually end up with only 6 pieces. Hopefully you see that each row is one of the pieces now. And the blue is exactly 1 of the 6. So 3 over 18 is the same as 1 over 6.
