Hi, this is Sal of the Khan Academy and we've always had a lot of content on Khan Academy for the various AP tests and we've actually been building out a lot for American History. So I'm here with Kim who's our History or American History fellow and what do you bring to the table here Kim? Did we just find you on the street? No, actually, so I used to teach college history for a number of years and last year I was like, I actually graded the AP US History exam so I have a pretty good insight into what the graders are looking for when you're looking at the test. And what we're hoping to do, you know, we did an AP review for Calculus a couple of days ago and it seemed to be really successful so we thought it would do today but this is still a little bit groundbreaking and we're still figuring it out just in terms of how to do these live streams. So give us your feedback, give us your questions on the comment thread below this. This is pretty exciting. I think you're part of the first ever live streaming AP American History review session in like in all of history. So this is a historic event. That will one day make our timeline of major points in American history. So I guess there's a bunch of ways we can tackle this but we have some stuff here. It looks like you've made a timeline of all of American history. Yes, this is my beautiful timeline. And so maybe we could first go through just a quick overview of it just so everyone here, including myself, has context. And then you've put together a pretty neat, I would say kind of high level study guide that has the different periods as well as the different themes that the AP American History test cares about. So we've uploaded a screenshot of this to Facebook so you can take a look at it yourself. So basically what we're doing here is taking kind of the thousand yard view of American history and examining these themes like migration and labor over time to kind of get you a sense of how things are moving that will help you build intuition about what's going on in a particular moment in American history. And not only will this help I think everyone understand the layers of American history, but these are often just even called out on the essay portion of the exam or even the multiple choice. Yeah, absolutely. And this will kind of build that backbone for you so that when you're sitting down to answer an essay question, sitting down to write a multiple choice question, you can say, what was going on in American culture in the early 1900s? Oh, yeah, this was the jazz age. This was a period of internationalism. Nationalism, right? Awesome. Awesome. Well, let's get, I know people are watching from home. Probably can't read this one. I'm just holding it up like this, but it's available for download. Yeah, we'll make that more obvious if it's not already. So let's get started. Let's do a walkthrough, what, 400, no, 600 years of history. Yeah, it's 600 and that's not counting. We're going to do it multiple times. We're going to try to do seven times in an hour. Yeah. So that's not counting like 15,000 years ago when people actually crossed the Bering land bridge into what would become North America. So we're kind of, we're skipping forward in time to say there were many native peoples who were living on the American continent in 1492, which was this moment of contact between Europeans and Native Americans. You have it right there. And then we see that you have the contact, but then what's the significance of Jamestown? Why does this make this timeline? Right. So the first kind of hundred years of settlement on the North American continent is like the Spanish. They're trying to just mine things. There's traders. So these are people who are taking resources from the New World and bringing it back to the old. They have no intention of staying. It's when we get to Jamestown and Plymouth Rock and Massachusetts Bay. This is when English settlers are coming to what will be the United States and planning on living there. I see. So this is your first, I mean, you're in America, Roa and Oak and all this, but it was the first permanent. First permanent settlement. First permanent settlement. In what would be the United States? That's a little after 1600 with 1608 or something like that. And then you get to kind of the formation of the country. What's going on in this kind of this really 200 year period? So that's kind of what we would call the colonial period. And this is when there are various colonies. We've got Massachusetts and Virginia and Georgia and Pennsylvania. We're all pretty much doing their own thing. And they're mostly focused on trade and farming, commerce, and they don't really see themselves as being even really part of a nation or really anything other than British subjects who are on the wrong side of an ocean. It's kind of in this mid 1700s period when the British empire starts really paying attention to the colonies. They're saying, wait a minute, aren't you supposed to be helping us out economically? Why can't why aren't we taxing you more? Why are they paying attention? Just they got big enough and there was enough people there and their economies were large enough to matter. Yeah, that and there's an economic depression in England. They have a lot of debt that they want to pay off. So they look across the ocean and say, we have a lot of people over there that we could be making more money off of. And for the American colonists who are very used to British, British power being super hands off, this is not okay with them at all. They didn't want that money just to kind of provide benefits to the English citizens. This was during an age of empire. They were really competing with the French and the Spanish. So there's this seven years war, also known as the French and Indian war, where the American colonists and the British are fighting against the French and their Native American allies. And this eventually the British succeed and the colonists succeed. But now England is in a lot of debt. They want to tax the colonists to make up that debt. And the colonists are saying, oh, we already helped enough. Right. We actually provided some manpower to do this fighting. So that's when they start really rebelling against British taxation. And not to dig too deep, we're trying to do a fast. But I always find it funny. You know, seven years when I learned in American history, like the seven years war or the French and Indian war. But as you say, seven years war, it's part of a larger theater. It wasn't just in the US. It's a... And this is a global war. And it's hard for us to see this. But this is these empires all over the world who are competing for territory and resources. So, you know, this is just one small part of a much larger war over empire. And then that kind of attention is billed and... Revolution. As far as revolutions go, the American Revolution is maybe a boring one, right? As this is a revolution over taxes. I've seen some very non-boring news about it. But it's got this sort of revolutionary idea of these enlightenment thinkers. Oh, I see. Because you're saying it's economic. Right. But then there's principles underlying that. Right. So the principles of, you know, consent of the government is where, you know, government draws its power instead of absolute monarchy. You know, this is kind of the birth of true democracy in the United States. It's going to really spread throughout the world. These ideas from the revolution go many places in the world. And it's a successful revolution. And it's, I mean, it is unique and it inspires the French Revolution in certain ways. And so now you have this, you know, and the revolution in 1776, you have the Declaration of Independence, but it isn't until the early 18... Oh, late 1880s. Late 1800s. Sorry, the late 1780s. There we go. That you have the Constitution as we know it. Right. And so the Constitution is kind of the blueprint of American government. So before that, there was the Articles of Confederation, which was a very weak government system. You know, they had just fought against this tyrannical power abroad and they were saying, all right, well, we're going to make sure that we don't have a central government that is going to be tyrannical at home. Unfortunately, that meant that their government couldn't do anything. So the Constitution is kind of this amendment saying, OK, we are going to organize our government into a judicial executive and legislative branch. Which, I mean, it was completely a redo. It was completely a redo. Yeah. And they basically built the system of government with its checks and balances that we still have today. Yeah. And so where this new country at the, you know, pretty close to the turn of the century, now we get into the 1800s. Yeah. And so the 1800s for the United States is really this period of expansion, both sort of expansion of markets, expansion of technology and literal territorial expansion. So early on, there's kind of the War of 1812, which we call maybe Revolution Part Two, British Leave Us Alone. Really, we meant it. Followed by... What was the British were... I mean, it was another... They were back. What was the factor that brought them back? Oh, well, they never really left, actually. They were dead. Yeah, they're up in Canada, they're in the Great Lakes. And what really led the United States to declare war on England is the impressment of American sailors, which meant that British ships, most powerful navy in the world, would be stopping American ships and saying, hey, all you Americans, you must be British sailors who jumped ship. You belong to us now. So the American government declares war and they kind of get this final go ahead saying, all right, England, get out of our affairs. OK. And so the US wins again. Yes. And as we were expanding territorially, but there's kind of tensions building in line with that expansion. Yeah. And the tension here is the existence of slavery. Right. Slavery started in the United States back in the 1620s. So this was kind of the... Shortly after, you know, shortly after Jamestown. Shortly after Jamestown. So enslaved people from Africa and the West Indies are being brought to what will become the United States and later the United States as laborers for cash crops. So they're working in cotton fields. They're working on tobacco. And even though the American Revolution is built on this idea that all men are created equal. She'll draw a parallel line to show this. So roughly here, I mean, all of this is, you know, slavery is, you know, cannot. Yeah. It they just really did not solve the problem of slavery. So, you know, to get the cooperation of the southern states at the time of the revolution, they kind of punted on this issue of slavery and they continue throughout. The founding documents are very principled on people being equal and life, liberty, all that. But yes, it was kind of like, OK, we'll not dig in too deep. What that means right now, just so we're unified. Exactly. But then as we added territory, why did that somehow exacerbate the issue as we added territory? The problem would be kind of the balance of power in between the North and the South. So the early stages in the United States, and we can take a look at our map. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is, I'll see if we can do this. All right. All right. This is a beautiful map that I colored myself. We're scrappy here at Kine Academy. So, you know, when the United States was founded. So here are the 13 colonies there in red. And then with the Treaty of Britain at the end of the American Revolution, we get all this territory. These are already British territories. Britain hangs out up here. Right. And way over there. Yes. But then as the 19th century wears on, first, Jefferson acquires a whole bunch of territory in 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase. And I always find that interesting because it's often billed as like deal of the century. But Napoleon was in charge of France. He's fighting these wars. And he was his Navy was kind of being defeated. He's like, well, I can't protect that anyway. Yeah. So so he sells it off and he gets a whole bunch of money to help him. Exactly. So the other continent. So we've got this whole bunch of land. And then with the Mexican War, all of this land. And so you can see it kind of goes right over the boundary where slavery existed in the south. And this is kind of the line of slavery here. And then you have a lot of videos on this on Kine Academy. Yes. People want to dig deeper. And do. And then this is the free area up here. So they had managed to keep their representation in the federal government relatively equal. So they had 11 states that were free, 11 states that permitted slavery. And then as new states started to form out of these territories that might upset the apple cart, upset the balance of power. So they just kind of because if the if there were more free states in Congress, they might be more likely to abolish slavery or, you know, in general, pass law. That would be more beneficial to people who weren't part of the slave economy. And this wasn't just even a I mean, I'm sure there were people on both sides on like a principle level, like slavery is good or bad. It was also an economic. I remember you told me once, you know, Lincoln's father was kind of put out of business because he couldn't compete with plantations. Right. So, you know, there are many white people who are living in the north, who are living in what is now the Midwest, who, you know, they didn't have any real moral opposition to slavery. What they wanted was to be able to move out to this area and not have to compete with someone maybe moving from here with 100 slaves who he doesn't have to pay. You know, how is this guy going to be able to sell his grain for less than someone who's got free labor? Yes. And so you have this honor expected. Most of this is the 18. This is the 18. I'm just manifest destiny. Right. This is the era of manifest destiny. So these, you know, these tensions really continue as they're trying to balance power. And then, you know, in the course of the 1850s, there are more moral arguments about slavery. The abolitionists are saying slavery is evil. Slavery is wrong. Right. We've got to end it now. It doesn't matter what's happening over here. All slavery needs to go. And then there are sort of apologists for slavery in the south who are saying, you know, slavery is a good thing. You know, we've done so much for these people. And so, you know, there's just this this true. That's how you get up. There's a video you upload where you did an AP American history. I mean, they had a passage from one of these apologists. So this isn't you making it up. I mean, this is actually from one of these people. Fascinating. Fascinating. So this is the 1800s. And also, I mean, it's worth noting that the American Indians were also kind of being pushed back. Right. I mean, the 1800s are, you know, just a rotten century for Native Americans, maybe not as rotten as kind of this period of great death from disease that's happening really early in contact. But this is a time when Native American lands just continue to shrink and shrink and shrink. And even Native Americans who followed the rules, they assimilated, they converted to Christianity, found that they were still forced out into farther and farther Western lands because whites wanted those lands. And this broader world context, I mean, that also is where the U.S. started going from this kind of agrarian to because the Industrial Revolution, kind of an economic, I mean, an economic power. Yeah. It can start to rival the powers of Europe. Yeah. And I think that's a good sort of takeaway for the era after the Civil War. So we we have this great conflict of the Civil War. Yeah. The powder keg ignites. Right. Right there. And 1861 to 1865 and the North, the the free part of the United States prevails. So slavery is over. And there's this kind of brief period in the South where African-Americans have guaranteed civil rights. Basically, they've got a military there protecting their civil rights. And then at the end of Reconstruction in 1877, the North kind of gives up on protecting them. And so that starts the era of Jim Crow. It's kind of an occupied territory until that point. Yeah. And so this is where you have Jim Crow beginning. What is Jim Crow? You always hear that word. So Jim Crow was a no, no, just just Crow like the bird. It was a system of segregation. So dejure segregation or segregation by law that said that, you know, it was legal for whites and blacks to be in separate places. So this is the idea of separate but equal that comes up in the late 19th century, saying that it is perfectly fine to send black children only to black schools. It's perfectly fine to send white children only to whites. It's developing and there's barriers to voting and things like that. And that continues all the way to the 1950s, 1960s. It's a slightly different color. But, you know, that continues all the way until, you know, something like that. There's Jim Crow right over there. And as you said, this coincides with the Industrial Revolution, the U.S. really getting its footing as maybe people didn't realize it. But it was it was quietly becoming a world power. Exactly. And, you know, part of that power. It wasn't like on the world stage. Right. So the North went to all this industrial production to win the Civil War. And then they have all of these factories. What are they going to do with them? They're going to build stuff specifically steel for railroads. And so really by 1900, the United States is the world's leading industrial power. We make more stuff than anybody else. And then that gives us and we start flexing that power a little bit. You get the Spanish-American War right at around the same time, going into the turn of the century. And that's a war, an imperial war against Spain, which the United States is basically looking to flex its muscles, saying, oh, we've got this big navy. We're super wealthy. We've got great industry. Let's let everybody know. What was the what was the given cause and what is the actual cause? The given cause was that the Spanish in Cuba were oppressing the Cubans who were rebelling against Spanish rule. And then when the United States sent a ship down there to protect American interests, that ship, the USS Maine, exploded in Havana Harbor. It was probably a boiler malfunction. But the United States said, oh, no, they totally blew it up. The Spanish sabotaged our ship. So they went to war. They won easily, I would say. Exposons on ships are often used to justify war, only to later be found in Gulf of Tonkin Revolution later on in Vietnam. So, yeah, after this, the United States becomes an empire. They have islands in the Pacific, islands in the Caribbean. And those islands are places as far as the Philippines. Yeah. And there's no path to statehood for those islands. The United States has never before taken territory. They never expected the people who live there to become citizens. And that to some degree is almost a definition of empire. Exactly. It's when you have control over people who are not formal members of your nation. Right. And contrast that with the American Revolution, right? How much did the people in the United States, what would be the United States, like having a power across the ocean in charge of them? Not at all. So it's quite a turnaround for the United States to take on that role as the power across the ocean to a people that isn't self-governing. Yeah. And so now we go. This is kind of more modern times. And this is where, I mean, just as a reminder, Conakon has a lot of content on modern times. You've done a lot on the civil rights. I've worked on the World Wars. So for anyone who wants deeper context here, go there. And we actually have a lot of the revolutionary period. Yeah. We heard a lot from students when we started this project saying, you know, my teacher is trying so hard, but she can't get past 1945 or, you know, my teacher slowed down. We never got past Vietnam. And so what we did was say, let's start there. So if that's a place where you're feeling less confident, Conakon Academy has a ton of material in that period just to help students who are struggling with the later stages of American history. And it's videos, it's exercises, it's articles. Yeah. We actually have a few overview videos of all of American history, too, although this we're kind of making want to as we speak right now live. So we go into World War One, which once that wasn't really an American war. Not really. The United States only gets involved really late in 1917. And that's because the Germans continued to attack U.S. ships in the Atlantic. Yeah. The Lusitania famously. But this was I mean, this is kind of when the U.S. is like, wow, they can tip the balance. Yeah. It shows that they're a real player on the world stage. And, you know, someone like Woodrow Wilson tries to negotiate what will become the League of Nations, this first international organization for keeping the peace, which clearly does not work. It doesn't work. And the United States never joins it because there's this sort of isolationist streak. A lot of people said, oh, man, we should not have gotten involved in World War One. And we don't want to we don't want to get involved in another war if we commit to being part of one of these international peacekeeping organizations. Yeah. The U.S. is still kind of not not fully wants to be out there, the world's policemen, so to speak. Yeah. And I mean, they have an ocean in between them and a lot of those problems, which has worked out pretty well for them up until this point. You have the space to develop without having to fight wars all the time. Absolutely. Absolutely. And so we go into that postwar period. And how do you describe the 20s right before we get into the stock market crash? Well, the 20s are kind of this era of consumerism, right? This is when we've got all sorts of cool new gadgets like radios and cars and people are buying them on credit. So there's this massive expansion of American consumerism and also American dabbling in the stock market. You know, that was not something that an ordinary person did before the 1920s. It seemed like a really fun game right up until it didn't seem like. Until it crashed and you get a crash and then we're in the depression, the Great Depression. Yeah. So the Great Depression wasn't the first depression we talk a lot about it's the most recent big depression. Yeah. You know, the economics of the United States since the development of a market economy have always kind of been on this like 20 year cycle of boom and bust. And there are a whole bunch of other panic of 1837, panic of 1819, panic of, you know, there's a panic every 20 years when there's a bubble that bursts. But no bubble burst as badly as the bubble of the 1920s. Great depression. And how what effect did that have on like just the country? It was just a bad time and we got out of it or it hasn't somehow changed the fabric of. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, this was really the birth of the federal government having an idea that they have a responsibility for citizens welfare. Right. I mean, for most of American history, the biggest influence the federal government had on your life was the post office. Like that's the only time you saw the federal government and then started. Which is one of the themes we'll talk more about that the US has always been very much a both individualistic but also kind of states have a it's a very decentralized. Yes. People have been very suspicious of the central government. Yeah. So I mean, really, that's it. The post office until the Civil War when, you know, Lincoln expands a lot of federal power and institutes a draft for the first time. But it wasn't until the Great Depression that the federal government said it's up to us to make sure that our citizens aren't starving in the street. It's up to us to make sure that when you're old, you know, you can still live well when you're not able to work anymore. So that's kind of the expansion of what we call the social welfare state. And FDR shows up and he's kind of, you know, when people talk about Keynesian economics, he used it on a massive scale building dams. And I mean, some of it was, you know, to actually provide energy and all this. But also the theory is to jumpstart the economy to utilize all of that excess capacity to get the and that kind of starts how you have FDR. But then it really the pressure ends with with World War Two. Yeah, clearly we weren't all done in Europe with World War One. No. And World War Two, you know, the United States had continued to be very isolationist throughout the 1930s. Their idea was we've got enough problems. So they really tried not to get involved in World War Two as it was beginning in Europe. But then in 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. And so the United States joined this this World War. That was already going. The Japanese had invaded China in the late 30s or actually in the early 30s. And then you have, you know, the Germans had invaded Poland right well before the US joined the war. The Germans and the Japanese are allied. So after the the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the Germans actually proactively declared war on the United States. We might not actually have gone into a war with Germany had not the ally of Japan already declared war on us. Yeah, it's unlikely to be deeply covered in the AP American History exam. But since these were major things for the US, it was because a lot of people cite reparations and the Treaty of Versailles, Germany kind of. So you have a demagogue like Hitler comes to power and tries to kind of get that German pride going and builds this war machine that is got awfully close, scarily close. Yes. So then World War Two ends. And so how how is the US relative to the rest of the world after World War Two? Well, the United States kind of comes out of World War Two. Remember, they're on the other side of an ocean. So they're pretty much the only nation in the world whose industrial capacity is still functioning. Right. The United States didn't get bombed during World War Two. Yeah. The other great industrial powers are talking about Germany, England or UK, France, Japan. They got their factories were. Yeah, it's going to take them a long time to rebuild from that. So the United States really emerges as the world's preeminent industrial power. They're supplying stuff to everyone. And then they're in sort of a political standoff with the Soviet Union over basically what economic and political form the world should take. Yeah. You have Brett Woods and they create this kind of economic world order because they're competing against communism. Right. So they want that to win. Anyone who's aligned with them has a better economy and then obviously also like political and military escalation. And then that goes all the way until you have Vietnam, which is what's notable about Vietnam here? I guess it was, you could say, the hottest part of the Cold War. Yeah, definitely. Maybe some of the things in the 60s Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis got pretty hot. So the Cold War never involves an actual war between the United States and Russia. They never actually, you know, are fighting against each other directly. Instead, it involves a bunch of proxy wars or wars where the United States is supporting one side, usually the side that is associated with capitalism. And the USSR is supporting the other side that is associated with communism. So there's this sort of nationalist fight, what we call it, sort of a civil war in Vietnam, where northern Vietnam, which was communist, wanted to unite all of Vietnam under communism and South Vietnam had the United States' help in kind of staving that off. And this is fascinating how history all interweaves because Vietnam was a French colony. During World War II, the French get overrun by the British and so then the Japanese. And so you're left with that. And so there's kind of a power vacuum after World War II. And so you have these different powers start to stake hold. But then when you have, you know, communist China on to the north and now US and you have George Kennan and containment. We have a lot, once again, of content on this. You put Nixon resigning. Why is that notable? You know, we only list about 15 or 20 things here. Why is that in 400 years of American history? Maybe it doesn't deserve to be there. I don't know. But I could say, you know, Nixon was the last president during Vietnam and he says he's going to get the United States out of Vietnam. This was on both parties. I mean, Vietnam Kennedy, who's a Democrat, starts getting involved. Yeah. Then you have Johnson really escalates. Right. I mean, being pro-communist was not a political position in the United States. Or anti-communist or whatever. Right. So, yeah, both Democrats and Republicans. And then Nixon comes in. Everyone's saying that they want to take us out. It's not a popular war, especially later on. But then they can't help but getting further and further sucked in. Pretty much. So Nixon presides over this. The war is kind of winding down. And then it comes out that Nixon has kind of worked to undermine the Democratic process by spying on his... That's the same as Watergate. Yeah, Watergate incident. Or an office building or whatever. Yeah. So this is kind of a black mark on American democracy. But not the first. I mean, sometimes we think modern times things politics have gotten ugly and all that. But as you said in the video, some of this... Politics has always been ugly. Politics has always been ugly. But then we go... Cold War ends. That's definitely a big deal. Yeah. So the end of the 1980s, early 1990s, the Soviet Union collapses. And you can kind of debate how much the United States played a role in that. Most historians think that it wasn't very much. I mean, you know, it was economic collapse. Some would argue this arms race that Reagan helped accelerate really broke. Our economy could somehow survive that better than the Soviet economy could. Well, capitalism clearly provided a better way of life than communism. But the Soviet Union kind of fell apart under the weight of its own problems, I would say. So by 1991, the United States is the world's remaining superpower. And that's essentially the world we live in today, where you don't have this kind of, you know, two powers. You have the United States as the superpower and you have the smaller conflicts and, frankly, more complex in a lot of ways. Fascinating. So actually, our timer is went to sleep. We are in time. OK, so that was cool. Let's talk a little bit about some of these themes here. And we probably touch on stuff we already talked about, but just to reinforce it. So these are the themes that come from the AP. Exactly. Like these layers of American history. So the first one is American national identity. So we talked a lot about that. Yes, exactly. So this is kind of a what does it mean to be an American? Who is an American? And how does that change over here? It's the Native Americans. Exactly. And then and you have explorers kind of showing up for discovery or looking for gold. Yeah. And none of them are thinking I'm an American. All right. They're thinking I'm Spanish and I'm going to go home with all my gold and live like a king. Yeah. And then you have English settlers. And actually, why would you want to get on a boat and go, you know, three thousand miles and live in a forest someplace? For some people it was money. For other people. I cannot get land if you're kind of a serf, essentially a serf in England. Yeah. England has a real overpopulation problem at this time period. So there is a lot of poverty there. And this getting a land. Also religious freedom. Yeah. The pilgrims and whoever else they wanted to come. And these people tend to be more conservative religiously and they were somewhat ostracized in England. Yes. Yeah. So this is the Puritans that we're talking about. And this is a branch of Protestant Christianity, which is very strict. So they are they're not popular in England because the Anglican Church is not as strict. Yeah. It was in the ascendancy associated with the royal family. So they can either be persecuted in England or they can just give up and go to a new world and make a society that fits with their standards. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's starting to be you start having the settlements, the English settlements, we think of the US, current US. And then but at this point, people, you know, the 1700s, people consider themselves English citizens. They consider themselves English citizens or maybe Pennsylvanians or South Carolinians. They don't have a strong American identity. And then as we go through the revolution, now the identity starts building. Right. And so they have this sort of common cause against the British Empire saying, oh, maybe we need to join or die. Right. As Ben Franklin wrote and kind of develop an American spirit that will help defeat the British and make the United States. But to be clear, as we already as we already highlighted, even at this point, it was white males. Right. And not just white males, but wealthy white males who own land. This is who an American citizen is. When Jefferson is considering, you know, who do I want to vote in this new republic? He's not thinking everybody. He is thinking the wealthiest, best educated landowners who have that specific stake in the American nation. I think it's important. We talk a lot about things like slavery, but I mean, women weren't participants in this. I would put that on your timeline. Yeah. Next. We'll do that. Oh, yeah. When do women vote? Women don't vote until 1920. Yes. See, I'm sorry. It was more important than Nixon resigning. So this is World War I. Yeah. Somewhere right about there. It's right here. OK. So this is a long time. That's not even 100 years ago. I know. So anyway, back to this. So right here, it's it's it's white land holding men was a lot of maybe what some of you and some of the founding fathers were thinking. Yeah, not all of them, but some of them. But then it starts getting a little bit broader. Yeah. So if you think about American national identity in this this first part of the 19th century, I think you can think about it first as democracy expanding, because by the time Jackson is president in the 1820s, 1830s, the American electorate expanded to all white men. So you didn't have to own property. You know, you could be anyone who is fits the bill of white male and cast a vote. But there's also this kind of growing sectional identity. Right. If you're thinking about yourself as an American, you're probably thinking of yourself also as a Northerner or a Southerner. So it's a great early 1800s, very strong sort of sectional division as far as identity goes. And does that change with the Civil War? Sort of. I mean, you know, the the version of America where slavery is illegal prevails. So I think that's part of the national identity at that point. It starts to shift, at least on paper. African-Americans are allowed to vote. African-Americans males. Yes. Are allowed to vote. Yeah. And this is another moment for women's rights, because the 15th Amendment grants the right to vote to African-American men. And, you know, they were already making an amendment to the Constitution. So a lot of women's rights activists said, all right, starts to really become active. Yeah. Well, let's let's add women's rights to the 15th Amendment. And they didn't get it. Fascinating. And so then we get so we're getting to this period. African-Americans become more citizens, although, you know, it depends where they live and probably their economic situation and things like that. And so what is kind of, you know, we talked about the European immigration. And this, you know, in this period up here is being primarily English. When did it start becoming from other parts of Europe? Well, we would start kind of around 1840, which is the Irish potato famine. So there are just thousands upon thousands of Irish people who have given up in Ireland. They can't eat. And so they're coming to the United States for a new way of life. There are also political revolutions, revolutions of 1848 in in Europe that are driving lots of other Europeans, especially Germans to the United States. So that kind of goes on into the 1870s, 1880s. And then we have a huge wave of immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. So this is in Italy, in Russia. When is that roughly? That's at the at the end of the 19th century. So 1880s, 1880s. And this is this coincides with the industrialization. Exactly. So they're looking for jobs. You know, and you read these books like Upton Sinclair and all these books that are working in the factories, maybe under suboptimal conditions. And they're coming here for a better life. Yeah. And I think one thing that's interesting about this is because, you know, we have a definition of whiteness today that is very much based on skin color. Right. You look white, you're white. But they had a much different idea of who was white, who was an American citizen, because originally they thought Irish people were really considered not white enough. And then later on, they say, oh, well, someone from Italy, someone from Russia. They're too different from Anglo-Saxons to be considered white. So even though they have some political rights, they can vote. They're not really considered part of the American body politic like someone whose ancestry is English might be. Not really until I would say World War Two. Yeah. I mean, even, you know, in the 20th century, you know, it was a big deal. I mean, people it was a big deal. John Kennedy was Catholic. Right. Absolutely. Yeah. Because he's kind of. You know, yeah, Irish or, you know, the Catholics were Irish or Italians or from. And so this was a big deal that he was not Protestant. Yeah. And there's strong ethnic communities, too. This is why you have, you know, little Italy and, you know, Polish brotherhoods as these ethnic groups grew in American cities. And then starting around World War Two, these men all kind of get sent to the war together. They develop more bonds. And after World War Two, there's African-American. I mean, African-Americans fought on the Civil, fought on the Revolutionary War. Yeah, absolutely. But it becomes people start to identify as a nation of Americans versus language. I mean, English is the language, but around ethnicity. Yeah. And I mean, if there's one thing that brings people together, it's having a common enemy. Yes. So, you know, the idea we're American, you know, we're not German, we're not Japanese. These ideas really coalesce in World War Two to bring national identity more about being from the United States than having specific racial identity. Yeah. And so now you have after World War One in the 20s, women become participants, at least as voters. It takes a little while for them to get positions of power. Exactly. Like one position of power. Maybe might happen soon. But that's when they get involved. And so kind of those trends, would you say they kind of go through World War Two? Exactly. And then how would you say that they've changed since then? Well, I think the civil rights movement is one of the most important sort of political and cultural movements. Yeah. To come out of World War Two, which is, you know, think about being an African-American soldier in World War Two and you're in France and having to listen to someone say, the United States is the, you know, the location where democracy is true. When every man is created equal and you're thinking, hmm, yeah, that's not been my experience. Or if you're a second or third generation Japanese, you know, your grandfather, and you're from Japan to help build the railroads and your family's in an internment camp while you're fighting or something. Exactly. So, you know, they, a lot of African-American veterans come home and they say, all right, we listened to all this propaganda abroad. I think, you know, if we learned anything, it's how important voting is. So they really begin the civil rights movement, which is a national movement in the South and the North to first secure voting rights for African-Americans. And then they're sort of a more generalized movement for housing rights and poverty that kind of work toward a more inclusive idea of American citizenship. And it's really interesting because, I mean, this is not going to be the AP American history exam, but it's always worth citing. I always pointed out because there weren't a lot of other non-white people here then, for example, people from South Asia or, and that was a civil rights movement, frankly, for all of us. Because if that didn't happen, then you would have had segregation, I mean, more broadly. And the civil rights movement also inspires future social reform movements. So in the late 60s and 70s, there's the women's rights movement that said, you know, women shouldn't just be able to vote. They should also be able to hold the same jobs as men and be paid equally. Or the LGBTQ movements also pattern on the civil rights, saying we're going to use the same tactics of protest and advertisement of what's going on to try to change our social system. And you have figures like Martin Luther King, inspired by Gandhi, who was revolutionary in India during, you know, the lead up to World War II. So let's go through more of these themes, politics and power. All right. This one is a little bit more specific, I would say, just because we're talking about maybe who gets to rule, right? Who is in power? So I would say like this early period here, it's all about the Spanish. Yeah. Right. I mean, the Spanish set up this sort of system of slavery, basically, to try to extract wealth. Yeah. The best political tool up here was probably the gun. Maybe a ship. I would say probably the microbe would be the best political tool. Yeah. And then there's kind of a, I would say, a difference, again, between the North and the South for what political power looked like. You know, in the North, they kind of set up a very democratic system, right? They're small farmers, they're living in small towns. So they have town hall meetings and kind of decide things pretty democratically. I mean, there's there's religion and religion plays a really central role in what's important and and who gets power in the North. But in the South, there's a system of slavery. Right. And so there are these landowners who have thousands of acres of land and they really hold all the wealth and the political power. So even the democratic institutions of the South, like the Virginia House of Burgesses, are based on the wealth generated by slavery. Fascinating. And and that continues and obviously power, I mean, we talked about it into the Civil War. Yeah. And I mean, we can also talk about sort of the democratic and the political parties that arise in the early part of the United States. So what were the political parties of your early part? So at first, Washington warned us against parties. Washington was not a fan of political parties. That's strange. Most of us love them. Because he's better than a two party system. Terrible because it's just going to make us yell at each other all the time. He was not wrong about that. But the original parties were divided on this concept of whether power should be centralized in the United States or whether it should be diffused to the states. So the Federalist Party was all about central power. They wanted a strong central government. They wanted a national bank. They wanted lots of development. And then the anti-Federalists or we often call them Democratic Republicans were kind of the opposite of that. There are a house in there. Yeah. They wanted the states to have most power. They wanted a pretty small central government. And we mostly associate the Federalists with Alexander Hamilton, John Adams and then the anti-Federalists that their real standard bearer was Thomas Jefferson. Yeah. And if anyone has extra time while they're preparing, I highly recommend the Don Quincy Adams. What is it? Like a six or seven part. Oh, John Adams. John Adams. No, no, no. It's not Quincy Adams. It's Don Adams. That's a great base. That is really it's very inspiring. So we start out with the Federalists with John Adams and then an 1800. I think this is one of the most important political dates of the United States. March 3rd. I think that's the right day. 1800. Do you know what happened? March 3rd, 1800. That's also what you have. Jefferson versus no, I don't. What happened that day? Nothing. Nothing happened. Nothing happened because there was a peaceful transfer of power. Oh, from one political power from one political party to another. And that is basically unheard of. Can you imagine voluntarily giving up power in this sort of monarchistic realm? Yes. As recent nation building experiments have shown. It's hard to do. Yeah. So the anti-Federalists are pretty much more or less in power up until the slavery debate kind of becomes even bigger. And then the Federalists kind of die off because they were against the War of 1812. Nobody likes a hater. So the the Whig party kind of takes over. What are the Whigs? I always read what do they what do they represent? The Whigs. Abraham Lincoln was a Whig before he became a Republican. And the Whigs were pretty much for the development. They were pro railroad, pro canal. And who are the Whigs going against? They're going against the the Jacksonian Democrats who are kind of the the the heirs to the anti-Federalists. So just as Jefferson had only imagined democracy for wealthy white landowners and then Jackson said there should be universal white male suffrage. His version of this sort of anti-Centralized power. So this is like if I was a business owner at this period, I'd probably be a Whig. You'd probably be a Whig. If you were a small farm around the West, you'd probably be a Democrat. And in terms of the slavery issue, the Whigs were a little bit more. Generally anti-slavery. They're often sort of Northeasterners. They were generally very religious. And then Jacksonian Democrats were generally pro-slavery. And so when do we get into a kind of our modern period of parties? Well, I would say that this Democratic Party is still the Democratic Party that we have today. And, you know, as we've gone through the years and we've changed different issues, you know, what they stand for changes. And then in the late 1850s, the Republican Party was born. And the Republican Party was an anti-slavery party. The Whigs kind of fell apart in the late 1840s, I think is correct. And were replaced by the Republicans who had many of the same values but were specifically anti-slavery. Yeah, this was more like these were sympathetic to the anti-slavery. This was almost formed around the anti-slavery movement. And Lincoln gets elected as the first Republican president. Lincoln is the first Republican president. And so that was the spark as we've done in several videos where we talk about it together. Yeah. And so the Republicans pretty much stay in power up until World War I. That's when Wilson gets elected. He's the first Democrat to serve, I believe, in between the Civil War and World War I. Wow. So that's a long period. And this is, you know, this is the business interest party, which is going to do very well in this time. Yeah. OK. So you have the Republican. Yeah. And this period of industrialization, that's the Gilded Age. Yep. That's when, you know, you have the Carnegies and the, you know, so. So, OK. And so that period you see the swing back and forth in American history. Exactly. Between. I mean, this goes back to this politics and power theme. Right. That, you know, sometimes it's like the the Jacksonian Democrats, the everyman, very populist. And then it's it's 10 minutes. Oh, 10 minutes left. We could go a little over. We're having this is fun. We're trying to go fast. This is fun. We're trying to go fast. But you have these you have these swings and you have these swings between, you know, kind of the ever, you know, the common man and more populist movements and maybe more business interests or economic growth. Yeah. Sometimes they'll say, you know, the system isn't democratic enough. And then they'll say, oh, maybe the system is a little too democratic. So the Republicans, except for this this moment with Wilson, are in power until the stock market crash. Right. And this is a big hit for business. Yeah. And then you have FDR come in who maybe defines the modern Democratic Party. Yeah, exactly. You know, this is the new deal, this period of increased government work towards social welfare. And the Democrats who want to spend money on social problems, on social movements in general, they pretty much stay in power until Nixon. So there's a 30 year period where the Democrats are really defining world U.S. politics. It seems like something's in the air right now, but it's fun to connect. I mean, you seem like you have what parties stand for transitioning a little bit right now. Yeah. And I mean, after that, we generally think of the modern era as being more conservative than this era that came before it. Right. This is the time when labor unions are really strong and the government is spending a lot of money on social programs and kind of starting in the 1980s, there's been a little bit of a walk away from a little bit of a flip flop between the parties where you have the Republicans are a little bit more sympathetic to or the Civil Rights Movement is gets a little bit more sympathy from the Johnsons of the world from the Democrats. Yeah, this is a little bit confusing because there is a set of sort of a flip flop of the of the parties, especially the Democratic Party, the business interests, the business of economic growth and business that's kind of consistent with the founding of the Republican Party. Right. But the Democrats really used to be the party of slavery and later the party of Jim Crow with the Great Depression and then later the Civil Rights Movement. The Democrats said, you know, if we want to get the economy back on track, we're really going to need to use this federal money and later said, you know, we should continue to give a lot of power to the federal government. I mean, just going back to that whole, you know, states rights, I mean, FDR expansion of the federal government, too, which was so fascinating. We could we could we have many videos on this. I mean, we could do a couple of them. We could get more of these things or we could tackle a couple of questions. Do I do that? Oh, well, you all think. OK. First is that a couple of students are a risk of not the long essay. Oh, OK. Synthesis as a skill. All right. We repeat the question. Yeah. Sure. The question is how do we approach the long essay and just synthesis as a general skill? And we have a sample long essay question if you want us to work on through that. Yeah. Well, I said that right. We're not going to write it. We will speak to what could be written. All right. This one right here. Yeah. The revolution one. All right. Let's take this one up. I'm going to have to use your own counsel on migration and culture and society. So we're going to make this available. So people can. And I suggest everyone to take a look at these. I mean, Kim's done an incredible job here because this really talks about all of the major themes that these actually would be really good points to even bring up in the essay portion. So really encourage you to take a good look at this. Yeah. And I'm around. You know, I answer questions on Academy. I answer questions on YouTube. So and Facebook. So yeah, if you have any other questions for us, just let me know. Awesome. Let's read this. Some historians have argued that the American Revolution was not revolutionary in nature. Support, modify or refute this interpretation, providing specific evidence to justify your answer. So what would you do, when you see that you have this blank space to fill up? So I think all of the essay questions are kind of going to be like this. Do you support, modify or refute this interpretation? So we have we have three ways we could go with this. Right. We can say support it. The American Revolution was not revolutionary. We could say refute it. I want to refute it. Yeah. The American Revolution was super revolutionary or refute would be like or modify. This is yeah. This is a terrible question. Here's the right question. That's a little harder to do. I don't know. I can't think of something off the top of my head that would do that. Yeah. So support was like, no, it wasn't revolutionary, modify. It was like it was revolutionary in some respects, but maybe not in other respects. Refuged, I know it was actually quite revolutionary. Exactly. Yeah. Does anyone have a pen? A marker and sharpie? Yeah. So but just high level thinking. So just you personally, where do you fit all this stuff? I'm personally, my gut, when I read this, no, it is revolutionary. I would totally go the other way. That's good. Maybe I'm a negative man. And either one would be OK as long as we back up our points well. So, yeah, I would say so the question that they're asking here for us is, is the society before 1776 very different than the society after 1776 or after 1783? Right. So there are various things that we could think about here. We could think about politics. Right. We just have been going through these things like is the political system different? We could think about society, you know, our social roles, economics. Yeah, we could think about economics, geopolitics. Yeah. Or military or. Yeah. So do all the same things of those. So. How about geopolitics or culture would be another thing. I don't know how you can think it wasn't revolutionary. Let's look it out. Politics. Politics. I mean, the England at the time had some had a parliament and stuff, but it was still, you know, they had a king on their body. And they but now you had you had Thomas Paine and the rights of man and you have and you have this little this colony and they're taking on the most powerful military in the Navy for sure. We're probably military in the world and they're able to win. And they and it's all about rule by the individual and and these these these ideas that they resurfaced and in a lot of ways perfected from the Greeks and the Romans come back. But thousands of years, like, you know, roughly 1500, 2000 years later. This is great because. OK, so you're now doing like the pro revolution. Yes. And I'm right. The anti revolutionary side. I'm going to say that the revolution wasn't that revolutionary politically because the same people who are in power in the United States before the revolution were the people who were in power after the right after the revolution. But I would make that argument that sure, like the year after like this, but this revolution and just so you know, we did not prepare this completely improv right now. But these ideas are allowed when allowed over the next few hundred years, all of this other stuff to happen. You are making precisely Gordon Woods argument. So you are like brainstorming Gordon Wood right now. Yeah, well, it's it's true. But when I think of the revolution, the next day it might have not changed. But this was the spark that long term. Yes. And actually, almost immediately of the French Revolution, which didn't immediately, you know, it became somewhat tyrannical. But Napoleon and all of that, actually, even before Napoleon. But it did spark this in modern times, the spread of democracy. Well, we now take for granted constitutional democracies. This was it. That's that's a revolution. All right. Well, then, real me this, Gordon, would how different was American society after 1776 than it was before? Well, not right after. OK, not right after. But once again, because if the revolution didn't happen, then once again, you wouldn't have been able to have all of these. Not only do you have a democracy, but this even goes to economics. If the revolution didn't happen, you would have had the big power. England have all of this extra industrial might and all of this extra agricultural land. But now you had an economic power that was growing in the next hundred years. That was also a democracy. And so that combination. And so when you have a superpower here, that's, you know, it's it's imperfect. There's, you know, there's some parts that look a little bit hypocritical. But for the most part, it was true to to the tenants. And it became more and more true over time. It's continuing to. All right. So you're saying the long term, these social values came to pass. I'm going to say in the short term. I mean, how can you have a revolution that says all men are created equal and not and still have slavery? Right. Yes, it was it. It was definitely not. I mean, revolutions are never in fact, by definition. I mean, you can't point to a revolution that's like clean, that like, you know, people storm the whatever and then they put the king out of rule. And then the next day everything's hunky dory. Revolutions are all I know. Maybe you know more history than I do. But from what I know, they're always messy. And there's always a period where people are fighting and a lot of the people who had power before still have power. But they start an interesting conversation. But does that last for like 87 years, four score and seven years of slavery after the revolution? I guess. Yes. All right. How about economics? Economics, economic revolution. That I would not say so much. All right. So that's not. Yeah. For example, if you were to compare and that can be like a modify. And that's maybe a point to bring up is in the 1800s, economically, the US and England were in some ways very similar. They're, you know, they're developed. They're part of the industrial revolution. They were so if they were the same country, not unclear if they were that fundamentally different. All right. Well, I'm going to take the international view now and say in terms of revolutions, if you compare the American Revolution and the French Revolution economically, I mean, the French Revolution was a revolution of the people. Against the monarchy, right? Against the wealthiest people. Well, the United States doesn't change anybody's real. You're right. I agree with you. This was not an economic revolution. Yeah. I mean, you know, kind of there were pocketbook issues of taxation and representation, but it was much more. It was much more philosophical. It was economic for everyone. It wasn't one class versus another class while the French Revolution was like textbook. The class is fighting fighting it out. I think I'm winning right now. So you're going to need to provide some. I don't think I don't think I really I think you're very biased in this in this. So let's see geographically. Yeah, it's unclear. I think I think by becoming a nation, the ideas of manifest destiny became, you know, if you're part of the British Empire, you would have, you know, the sun never sets on the British Empire. They were already in India. They were already in Africa. They were, you know, they were starting to become be in Africa, especially in the 1800s. And so, you know, there could have been an argument that like, oh, well, just an extension of this already vast empire. While here is like this notion of manifest destiny. It's much more of a nationalistic thing. Right. So it causes manifest destiny. So it's a transformation of the American body politic. Yeah. And I might make the opposite argument that the American Revolution was terrible for Native Americans. Right. I mean, the British were the major power that were defending the rights of Native Americans. That's why in the War of 1812, Native Americans are going to ally with the British. So when you argue, I mean, for better or for worse, that would be an argue that that was a change. Yeah. So you can see it could go either way. I mean, and actually, in a certain way, slavery probably would have ended sooner. Yeah. If if we stayed a British colony. I would say so because slavery was outlawed in England before. And so yeah, we're structuring. There's multiple ways to structure it is how the world been different. Right. If the revolution happened, which is actually a fun thing. I mean, not that we're doing it. We'll continue this effort. It's a super fun thing. And I mean, just to you know, obviously, if we were taking the test, we wouldn't write it this way. Right. You'd write it out a little bit. But these are how does it get you you you've graded these things. How does this get graded? Well, I would say that what you want to do here is use each of these big themes as your topic sentences. So maybe, you know, if I were doing something like this, I might just write down some possible things I could talk about. Right. How does the economy change? How does the politics change? And then make notes and decide which side you fall on. And then use that as your thesis statement. Right. To say that, oh, the American Revolution is going to be a big thing. Right. Oh, the American Revolution was super revolutionary because none of these major social changes could have happened down the line without it. Or the American Revolution wasn't revolutionary at all because it changed nothing for actual people who live there. I stand still arguing for my thesis. I mean, this is why this framework is really valid. Because right when I first saw it, I was like, man, maybe I could write like a sentence on this. But then when you when you start to say, okay, we could talk about national identity, which is kind of culture. We could talk about politics and power. We could talk about work, technology and exchange and economics. Exactly. We could talk about cultural society, migration and settlement. So when you have this framework and, you know, if you just know, can use the dimensions I can talk about pretty much any essay statement. Exactly. Then all of a sudden you have a lot to write. Yeah. Consider these themes whenever you're thinking about writing an essay because they will kind of illuminate things for you about where things are changing and where things are staying the same. And the the graders, unlike you, are fairly impartial. And they're not going to. Right. Because as long as you are making a strong argument and you're providing evidence, then they know that you're, you know, think of them like a jury that you're trying to convince if you're a lawyer, right? You are making an argument and saying, here's why I'm right. And so what they're interested is, are you convincing them? Not are you saying what I want you to say? And how much do things like grammar and, you know, you have to be understandable. Be understandable. Yeah. Or like spelling grammar. You don't ding. I mean, be understandable. But this made your ideas. And I think, you know, when I took this exam more years ago than I care to remember. I took it even more years ago. But I had this idea that the graders were like, I'm looking for all the things that they did wrong so I can mark them down. But having graded it myself, what I noticed was that we were looking for opportunities to give people points like the people who have great this exam. They are a P. U. S. History teachers. They are college teachers and they want you to succeed. So they're actually on your side. So as much as time allows, keep writing. Yeah. Because there's a lot to write about. And you know, I make sure you give context. Right. Like, make sure you say who's doing something. When and why? Because, for example, if you say like, what's one one thing that the Europeans changed about Native American culture and you respond disease, right? There's not enough there for you to say, all right, well, where can you disease? And I actually don't know the answer to this. And when I took it, I wrote it out. But can you make a table? Yeah, right. Points on either side and then refer to I mean, is that recommend? Oh, yeah, that's totally recommended. You get 35 minutes to do this question. And I would say absolutely is the first 5 to 10 minutes just to make sure that you're doing it. 5 to 10 minutes just to make some notes in an outline for yourself. But even the table itself could be part of your answer. Maybe not. I mean, I think they're looking for the thesis statement. They're looking for the thesis statement. The topic sentences. Definitely use something like this to structure. Just get your thoughts in order. All right. We have a couple more. We're probably close to out of time. Let's do the one. Are we over? We're over time. You want to do one multiple choice just for kicks. If you want to. Let's do one multiple choice. We're sticking around. We're sticking around. This is too important. I'm still a little worked up about how you cannot think that that was a revolution. I'm just devil's advocate. Yes. All right. We'll do this one and then call it a day. Okay. So this is a typical multiple choice question for the AP exam and all of these questions they have either a set of quotes or graph or a political cartoon. So they're never in the void. They're always asking you to do a question. To refer to some information. So then they'll be like two to four questions that are actually related to. So let's just try to do this. So first let's actually look at our graph. You look at the graph first. I read the question. I will look at this graph while you're reading this question. The pattern depicted on the graph. And I have not seen this question before. We're going to just give the raw. How do you do it? Let's see Sal get this wrong. The pattern depicted on the graph from 1450 to 1800. All right. That's the years here. Best serves as evidence of which of the following. Now I'm going to look at the graph before the choices. Let's see. Number of Africans transported to the new world between 1450 and 1900. So those are our bounds. And then we see very few were transported prior to 1600 which is consistent to what you were saying. It wasn't being settled. It was kind of exploration and try to get riches and stuff. Then you have more in 1600, 1700. You start having permanent settlements. Right. Referencing. I'm just thinking what I just learned from you. Yeah. Using the logic of the context. Yeah. And then 1700s to 1800s you have a that's the peak of influx. And this is the peak of kind of I'm guessing. Yeah. Settlement of his creation of plantations and especially in the south. And then it dies off here especially because I mean actually before the Civil War the importation stop started to slow down. Yeah. And then after the Civil War it was abolished. So that's why you have this. Okay. So now I have I think I've. You've got the context. Yeah. So the pattern depicted on the graph from 1450 1800 best serves as evidence of which of the following. The replacement of indigenous labor and indentured servitude by enslaved Africans in new world colonies. No that just doesn't feel right because indigenous labor we didn't even talk about indigenous labor as being a major. Oh yeah. Let's see. One thing I want to put in dentured servitude. Yeah. That's interesting. One thing I want to point out here is that it says 1450 to 1800. Oh okay. Not including this. So let me get this wrong. Let me get this wrong. Okay. Don't help me too much. Sorry. The development of varied systems of racial categories is very important. Of racial categorization in the. This doesn't refer to that. That's definitely I can rule that out. I'll definitely rule that out. The effectiveness of the abolitionist movement in Europe and the Americas. So that could speak to this. But they're saying between 1450 and 1800. So we're not even looking. We're not even looking at this. So if you just look at that part you just see this upward trend. So that doesn't apply any effect. Yeah. So let's cross that one out. The susceptibility of enslaved populations in new world diseases. No this doesn't say this doesn't say whether people survive or not. Right. Well I think that's a good thing. That's definitely not it. And so the thing that I was about to rule out. Because I was like indigenous labor. And I'm thinking more Native American labor which I'm not aware of being a major source of labor. In like Mexico the Spanish used a lot of indigenous labor. But it wasn't as big. Oh you're right. And this is to the new world. I'm kind of a U.S. center. But you're right. I mean we do read about indentured servitude. You get your trip to the new world but you have to work for seven years. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. But this is a good example. Right. Because this is one where Aiden jumped out at me. In fact when I first read A I'm like yeah I don't. Indigenous labor. But then these other three were way more wrong. Yes. The chart had very little to do with them. Right. And it's best serves as evidence. Yeah. So even if you're like man that's maybe not the greatest thing. It's better than all the other choices. So this is evidence that I'm doing this the first time. Yes. And I'm going to do that. I'm in the AP American issue. Which of the following conditions do you think the American nation is better than the other? Yes. Yeah. So let's look at what you see here. So what you see here is the emergence of a more industrial economy in the United States. So I mean they're talking about Great Britain. We're talking about transportation to the new. Contribute most to change it. Transported to the new world. So in Great Britain. Industrialization. I guess your less these large agricultural plantations. Yeah. Okay. I'll think about it. The outlawing of these international slave trade by Great Britain in the United States. That seems interesting. I'll kind of you know I'll start that one. The increased resistance to slavery within African nations. We didn't talk a lot about that. And I don't remember. So I don't know. This one doesn't seem to write the influence of major slave rebellions in Haiti and elsewhere. No there were rebellions but that shouldn't impact the overall. So and and just having a more industrial economy you still have large I mean it's still a very agricultural country at the time in the early 1800s. So that might have been more in the north. And that's why frankly they were more on the abolitionist side. So yeah the outlawing of the international slave trade which makes sense. Yeah. You're right. I'm right. Thank you. All right. Well we're all done. Hopefully everyone enjoyed this. Any parting thoughts for the test takers? Don't stress right. The test is not designed for you to know every little fact. What it's designed to do is to test your kind of historical reasoning right. Do you have this general overall sense of what's going on and using that knowledge. Can you make a good guess. I didn't guess. I do. Yes. I do. Put on your. This is not a guess. This is a deduction. Can you deduce the correct answer. So you know think about the large themes and don't sweat the details. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Good luck.
