Write 5 and 1 fourth as an improper fraction. An improper fraction is just a pure fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator. This right here, it's not a pure fraction. We have a whole number mixed with the fraction, so we call this a mixed number. So let's think about what 5 and 1 fourth represents. And let me rewrite it. So if we're talking about 5 and 1 fourth. And you can literally think of this as 5 and 1 fourth, or 5 plus 1 fourth. That's what 5 and 1 fourth represents. So let's think about 5. 5 is 5 wholes, or if you're thinking of pi, we could draw literally 5 pies. And let me just cut up the pies from the get-go into 4 pieces since we're dealing with fourths. So let me just cut up the pies right over here. So that's 1 pie right over there. Let me copy and paste this. Copy and paste. So I have 2 pies. And then I have 3 pies. And then I have 4 pies. And then I have 5 pies. So this is what the 5 represents. 5 literally represents. So let me circle all of this together. That is the 5 part right there. That is what 5 literally represents. It represents 5 whole pies. Now, I have cut up the pies into 4 pieces. So you can imagine each piece represents a fourth. Now, how many pieces do I have in these 5 pies? Well, I have 4 pieces per pie. I have 4 pieces per pie. 4 pieces per pie. 4 pieces. Well, let me just write it here. 4 pieces per pie times 5 pies is equal to 20 pieces. Or another way to think of it, since each piece is a fourth, this is also equal to 20 times 1 fourth. Or you could just write this as being equal to 20 fourths. So we have 5 whole pies is equal to 20 fourths. Let me write it like that. 20 fourths. Or we could write it as 20 over 4. I've kind of done the same thing twice. So that's what the 5 pies represent. 20 fourths or 20 pieces, where each piece is 1 fourth. Now, the 1 fourth right here represents literally 1 more piece of a pie, or 1 more piece of a pie. So let me draw another pie here. Cut it into 4 pieces. But this 1 fourth only represents 1 of these pieces. This is 1 of the 4 pieces. The 4, the denominator, tells us how many pieces. The 1 tells us how many of those pieces we're dealing with. So it's just this 1 piece over here. That right there is the 1 fourth. Now, if we write 5 and 1 fourth, we just saw that the 5 right here is 20 fourths. So we could rewrite this. 5 and 1 fourth can be rewritten as, this is the same thing as 5 plus 1 fourth, which is the same thing as, we just saw that 5 whole pies is the same thing as 20 fourths. And to see that these are the same thing, you literally just divide 4 into 20. You get 5, and nothing is left over. So 5, the same thing, is 20 fourths. And then this plus 1 fourth is the same thing as plus 1 fourth. So if I have 20 fourths, and I add 1 more fourth to it, how many fourths do I have? Well, I have 21. I have 21 fourths. Or another way of thinking about it, this 5 is, so this right here is, that right there is 20 pieces. 20 pieces of pie. And you can even count it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But a quicker way is to say, well, we have 5 pies. Each of them have 4 pieces. 5 times 4 is 20. This 1 fourth right here represents 1 piece plus 1 piece. So total we're going to have 21 pieces. So we have 21 pieces where each piece is 1 fourth. So you could say we have 21 times 1 fourth, or 21 fourths pieces of pie. However you want to think of it, but we've solved the problem. We're at an improper fraction. We've written 5 and 1 fourths as an improper fraction. I've gone through great pains to give you the intuition of what 5 and 1 fourths means. But there is a fairly straightforward process for getting straight to the improper fraction. Let me color code it. So if you have 5 and 1 over 4 to convert it into an improper fraction, you literally, you're going to keep the same denominator. So you're going to have the over 4 there. But your numerator is going to be your numerator of the fraction part before. So it's going to be 1 plus your whole number times your denominator. So 1 plus, actually let me do it the way I tend to think of it. What I do is I take 4 times 5, so let me write that down. 4, I want to color code it, 4 times 5. And then to that, I add this numerator. So I literally do 4 times 5 plus 1, which is, so this is equal to 4 times 5 is 20 plus 1 is 21. And that's over 4. So it's 21 fourths. And although this is kind of a fast way to do it, we're literally doing the exact same thing that we did here in a kind of a slower way. We're saying, OK, 5 wholes is the same thing as 20 fourths. So you take 5, and I figure that out, times 5 times 4. And then I have one more fourth there. So 4 times 5 plus 1 gives 21.
