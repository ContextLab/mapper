Hey this is Sarah from Khan Academy and I'm going to show you how to use our give feedback on my academic essay activity from Khanmigo. Like all other Khanmigo activities you can get here from your AI activities page under the right section of the menu. And when you get here you'll notice this My Essays page. This is where you can revisit older essays you've worked on or continue revising an essay that you didn't quite finish yet. I'm going to go ahead and start a brand new essay by clicking on this blue button. Now here's a section to paste your essay. Select your grade level and essay type and paste in the essay prompt or instructions from your teacher. And now I will copy and paste my first draft. And now I'm submitting for review. Now what Khanmigo is doing is it's taking my essay and it's looking for suggestions in these five main areas. And you can actually click around and see the different feedback for each area one at a time. In introduction it's looking at suggestions related to the overall paragraph structure for an introduction. Is there an engaging lead or a hook? Did I provide enough context on the subject for the reader? Is my argument or thesis well structured and does it actually respond to the essay prompt for my teacher that I provided? And under evidence Khanmigo is first making sure that I've provided enough evidence but it's also looking at the relevance of my evidence. Does the evidence I've used here actually support the points I'm trying to make? I might see suggestions here about how I could better introduce or integrate my evidence into the paragraph or if I need to add more explanations or reasoning to connect the evidence to my points. Structure is related to your essay's organization. So it's paragraph structure, how it flows, conclusion looks at have I summed up my points clearly, have I left my readers with something to really think about and style actually covers a lot of things like the tone of my essay, the vocabulary that I use, things like grammar and mechanics. So let's go ahead and look at some of these suggestions. You'll notice that right here I have two suggestions for introduction but I have three pieces of feedback below and that's because the top one is actually a bit of praise so there's no action for me to take it's just Khanmigo giving me a little bit of positive reinforcement. So let's look at these two suggestions for introduction. The first one is about the beginning of my intro so that's something I'll probably want to brainstorm and add in and this one is about my thesis so it's suggesting that I add a bit more detail in my thesis about how I'm going to support my argument and let's say I don't really know what that looks like or how to do that so I'm going to click on chat with Khanmigo. So now I can have a conversation with Khanmigo about this specific piece of feedback. I can get it to explain the suggestion if I don't really understand what it means but I think what I could really use here is an example so let's see what happens when I click on give me an example and of course it's not going to just write it for me because then it wouldn't be my work and I wouldn't be learning anything so Khanmigo is giving me something called an exemplar, a sample of writing on a completely different topic that I can use as a model for the structure of my thesis and I can see here that the exemplar doesn't just include the main argument but also briefly previews the main points from the whole essay so now I'm going to try updating my thesis to do that and I'm going to revise my thesis right over here to list the main points or reasons for my argument so my thesis is that Friar Lawrence is the most responsible for the tragedy in Romeo and Juliet due to his role as a trusted advisor, his involvement in their secret marriage, and his unfortunate planning and these are the main points that I've already included in my three body paragraphs below. Now I'm going to ask Khanmigo is that better and it looks like I did a pretty good job so I'm going to mark this as resolved and go back to my list of feedback and I can keep going through and getting help from Khanmigo where I need to, making revisions to the different pieces of my essay based on the feedback. I can even do things like use Khanmigo as a thesaurus if I'm getting suggestions for improving my vocabulary or making changes to my tone and my language. I can ask it to explain what different pieces of feedback mean and of course I can revise right here on the page and then have Khanmigo check right away if the changes that I made have addressed the suggestion and remember that when you're done you can copy and paste your essay to submit to your teacher in your LMS or wherever it was assigned and if you want to take a break and finish revising later you can just give your essay a title and come back to it anytime from the main activities page. All right that's it, happy revising!
