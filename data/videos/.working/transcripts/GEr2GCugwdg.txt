All right. Everyone can hear me and see my screen. Yes. So hi, everyone. Welcome to the kickoff of Khan Academy and New York State partnership. So today I really have a very important question. Before we get started, how are you feeling on a scale of my dog, Luna? You just go ahead and type a number in the chat. If you have your camera on like Andrew, you can hold up a number. I am a five. I'm so excited to be here with you all today. So I'm very happy, very happy to be hosting this event right now. Okay. We have some more fives. Yay. Some nines, some sixes, feeling a three, but want to rock the unicorn. She was so grumpy that I put that on her face too. I love the grumpy unicorn. Today I had a onesie that matched, so she and I had matching Halloween costumes. Well I'm really excited today because we are going to share with you all about Khan Academy, Khan MeeGo, how you can partner with us, how we can support you in your districts. So this will be a action packed, well not really action, it's more like information packed, but maybe I'll do some hand things to make it action packed. Informational webinar and then we'll talk about next steps. But first I want to introduce our New York team. So my name is Danielle Sullivan. I'm in charge of the district partnerships for the Northeast. We have Sarah Thaler on the call, if you want to say hey to everybody. Sarah is our district success manager, so she will be handling the implementations in New York state. Then we have Deanna Clingman. She's our professional learning specialist. She'll work with the BOCES trainers and be the face of PL for our New York districts. And then Allie Walther is helping me and all of our team be able to get you what you need in a really fast turnaround time the best we can. So we are your New York state team. We're really excited to be here. And I just wanted to share since I'm your presenter today a little bit more background on me. I am from Oswego, New York. What, what? And I went to school at Wells College in central New York. I worked in New York state government. And then I taught in New York state schools. Actually taught in candor, which is outside of Ithaca. So I was a former New York fifth and sixth grade special education teacher. And I've been in the ed tech space for, oh gosh, about 15 years now. And you might have seen me some, I probably met a lot of you in my previous roles working with another ed tech company in New York state. But I also used to be an improv comedian. So I'm telling you this will be also informative and a little bit of entertaining. I can't help myself. So I'm excited to share with you today all about how we're supporting you. But let's start with who has seen any of Saul's Ted talks. Who knows who Saul Kahn is read any of his books. You can put a plus one in the chat. Great. Or how many of you saw 60 minutes in December? I had a lot of conversations with districts after that. That was a great piece. So it's really cool that we have the 60 minutes piece is actually on the New York state landing page. If you want to rewatch that, we were really fortunate to be featured there. But I want to start with a quote from Saul because I think it's really important to set the tone because AI is really new for all of us. It's new for many of the educators in New York that I've been talking to. It may not be new to you personally, but implementing AI is new. So I like to start this with framing from Saul's new book, Brave New Words, Educated Bravery. To get the very best from this technology, we need to reconsider what is possible. We need to ponder and mitigate risks and fears, which I'll talk about today, how we're doing that at Kahn Academy. But we also, it requires rethinking everything. We are at a turning point education with far reaching implications. So what can we do with this technology now? So I'd love another quick scale mood meter. When you think of AI, how are you feeling about AI, either personally or professionally, on a scale of hose in the face, terminator? You're like a little too Geico Pig excited. So let's see how many of you probably are feeling super overwhelmed. Okay, we got a couple. We have some Geico Pig excited, couple of hesitancies. So it's kind of like we're kind of on the bottom quadrant here. We're a little nervous, and then a four. And then sometimes it feels like you're a hose in the face. I know. It seems like there's a new AI company coming out every two seconds. It's a lot to handle. So I hope today we're going to show you why we're a little bit different at Kahn Academy and how we're supporting schools. So here's our agenda for the flow today. And we have the chat up. Sarah is my co-pilot today. Thank you, Sarah. If we have questions, you can just throw them in the chat. I will stop after each section to see if there's any questions. But I do. There's a lot I want to share with you today. So we are recording this. We'll share the recording out with you. We have a lot of informational pages, all of that. So first, we're going to talk about how humans are still first, how learning should be the goal of schools and how we're supporting learning with AI, how we're saving teachers' time with their teacher AI tools. Writing is a huge, huge push in New York State, writing across the curriculum. So I'm going to share how we're thinking through that. And then finally, we're going to finish with safe and responsible implementation of AI. And again, ask any questions as we go. So I'd like to start here because I think it's helpful to ground ourselves and why we are here. Why are we even in education, right? Who's ever seen Rita Pearson's TED Talk? Like one of the best TED Talks I've ever seen. Children don't learn for people they don't like. It's true again and again. So when we're thinking of AI, when we are thinking of these solutions and this technology, I just want to share it's important to put humans first. And it's important for educators to believe that kids are more capable than we think. And it's important for leaders to believe that teachers are more capable than we think. And I want us to hold that human connection as I'm sharing our tools and solutions with you today because there are some things that still work universally, showing animals, baby goats in jail, like that's a really great way to connect and also smiling and greeting kids as they come into the building. If you've ever seen me present, I presented a lot in New York in my previous world. I'm very much about human connection. I brought that energy to Khan Academy. And today I want to show you how we're thinking through with learning and human connection, but I just like to root ourselves in the human experience. So let's talk about learning, the act of learning itself. It is loud. It is messy. It is unpredictable. It's extraordinarily vulnerable. We are asking students to show up every day in school. We are asking them to try things they don't know, screw up all in front of their peers, do it again and again. We're also asking teachers to try this new technology, to take risks, to create these environments for students. It requires the right environments and leadership and tools. And if you know any neuroscience about reading or learning, or if you've read any of the research, basically humans, I'm going to say, I'm going to say students here, but it's really humans. Students learn best when, when they are actively engaged in what they're learning, when it's at the right edge of struggle, it's right at their edge of struggle. It can't be too easy or too hard. It's like the Goldilocks principle of learning. It has to be just right. And that just right depends on every single student. They need immediate feedback on what they're learning and they have to see the relevancy of it. Good teachers do this again and again. Good leaders know this. But it's difficult to get to this magical part of learning when there's so many issues in education. And I like to show this because a lot of times wonderful things in education turn into posters and die on the wall. Like Carol Dweck's work with Growth Mindset, Angela Duckworth-Grit, John Hattie, Visible Learning. I could rattle off all these researchers, but you'll go into a classroom, you see a bunch of board students with all these posters on the wall, or even more of a challenge. You have a lot of students packed into a classroom. And since COVID, where teachers used to see three grade levels of difference, you're seeing four and five grade levels of difference. A lot of times high school is actually the new middle school. Middle school is the new elementary school. Like you have a lot of challenges. So where I want us to think about is how at Khan Academy we're supporting educators and solving some of these problems. So first, who are we? What is Khan Academy? Who are we? We are a nonprofit. Our mission is to provide a free world class education to anyone, anywhere. So today I'm going to show you, we do have a lot of tools for free, but what we're specifically talking about today is our district partnership. And I'll explain the difference between the free versus what's part of our district partnership. However, what is universal, no matter what tools we build, is that we believe in learning. All of our tools, all of the AI, all of the technology, why we paired it the way we did with our Khan Academy content is because learning is the North Star. Our goal is to help your students experience grade level success. And how do we do that? We pair it with our mastery learning system that has been proven again and again to be very, very impactful for students to close gaps. So it all started with Sal Khan in 2006. He started making videos for YouTube because he was tutoring his family. And then more and more people started seeing those videos and finding them super valuable. So in 2010, he created Khan Academy, which is what our platform sort of looked like today. But then so many teachers were using it. They asked Khan Academy, you know, it'd be really great if we could see data or maybe have automatic rostering or maybe a little bit more support around these tools. So in 2018, we created Khan Academy districts. And then the game completely changed in 2023 when we came out with Khan Amigo. So today, I'm going to share with you how we're thinking through learning for students, learning for teachers, learning and writing, and then how we're doing this in safe and responsible manner. So I'm going to go live and first explain the differences between what's free and what is part of the partnership. So any human on the planet can sign up for a free Khan Academy account and have access to all of our courses. And I just want to remind all of you, because a lot of educators in New York have been using Khan Academy for a very long time, but we're more than just science and math. We have added ELA. We're building this out even more. We have added more support for digital SAT, including we're adding some getting ready for SATs, financial literacy courses, AI for education courses, climate projects. We keep adding more and more courses. So this content, any human can sign up for this, that is free. Last spring, we provided 98% of our AI teacher tools also for free. And then a couple months ago, we provided our writing coach for free. So I'm going to go into writing coach a little bit more in a bit. So you're like, cool, that's great. We can use a ton of free stuff. But what is this? What can I buy through BOCES? What is this? So it's called our Khan Academy Districts program. What this includes, and I'm going to go over this again at the end, but you can have automatic rostering through Clever or Classlink. You're going to have a team, a dedicated support team to help you with implementation. So Sarah is the face for New York. I'm the face for New York. You also have data, which is very important because you could have so many of your teachers using Khan Academy in isolation, but there's no way for you to see what students are doing. So not only can you see what students are doing on Khan Academy, you also can see what students and teachers are doing with Khanmigo. So it's rostering, support, data. It's the only way to get the student facing AI tools. We still want to make sure that we are rolling this out in a responsible way. So that is part of our district partnership. And then the final part of the partnership, when I say 98% of the teacher tools are free, we give teachers chat GPT. That is part of the partnership. And then teachers can also use the teacher tools with Khan Academy content. So that all rolled together. That is what we're talking about today. And we are so close to like inches from finalizing the agreement. We have been working on this agreement. I feel like half my life, I'm so excited and so fortunate and so grateful for the teams that have worked on it, both on the BOCES end and our end. So very, very soon you'll be able to purchase through BOCES and we can come and we'd be happy to partner with your district. So let's talk about Khanmigo, the student tool. How were we approaching learning with students? How do we build this tool to be able to enhance learning? So Khanmigo wears three hats. We have Khanmigo that works with Khan Academy content. We have Khanmigo that works under some independent learner activities. And then we have the teacher Khanmigo tools. So I'm going to start by showing you how it works alongside Khan Academy content. Now when we think about Khan Academy content, the great thing is this comes with our partnership. So you can automatically roster classes in Khan Academy and then use these AI tools to support. Our math is aligned to New York standards. The rest of the content is common core. We are tightly aligning more of our science courses to the next generation science standards. My hope is in the future we'll have a lot more New York aligned content. I can't promise anything, but I can tell you that I've done a close crosswalk with standards and there's a lot of really great resources you can still use even though it's not 100% ELA aligned New York standards. But I want to share that Khan Academy is a mastery learning system. It is very flexible in the way that a lot of districts are using it. So you can use it as a supplement. You can use it as a compliment. You can use it to have students fill in some prerequisite skills that they might need. You could have students use it in acceleration. You could assign it for homework. There's so many ways that you can use Khan Academy. But I'm going to share an example that if I'm an Eligible One teacher, I am using Khan Academy as additional practice and I'm assigning to students either to complete in class or for independent work and study hall or for homework. So that's the use case I'm using here. But even our goal for New York is I really want to zoom in on math. When we meet to talk about a partnership, we'd love to talk to you about how we can support your middle school math, high school math, SAT prep, and even writing across the curriculum. Those are kind of the content areas that are really successful that we've seen that could really help New York educators. So back to this, if I've assigned equivalent expressions and I'm a student working on this independently and I'm stuck or I want a little bit harder, this is where CommEgo comes in. So I'm going to make CommEgo a little bit bigger so you can see. So a couple things right away. We are again inches away from having a new New York State Data Privacy Agreement. And I'm explaining the difference between the data privacy. First off, we have been EdLaw2D compliant. We have been so a lot of people ask, are you? All of our Khan Academy courses have been. The teacher tools are. So we have a DPA that covers all of that in place right now. So if you want to use the free tools for the rest of the year, you can. Courses you can. The new New York State Data Privacy Agreement, which I will cover again at the end of the session, that covers CommEgo, the student facing tutor, which I'm showing you right now. So we value data privacy and security. So we made sure to have that in place as well. But we also literally saying here, do not share personal data. We don't want students to share any personal data. We do log the chat, but we log it more for your use as a district. It is not sharing students chats back with open AI. You can have the chat logged for an academic year. Leaders can see the chat. Teachers can see the chat. Students can see their chats. And if they choose to share it with families, they can see the chat too. So there's ways to actually use AI to summarize what students are talking to KhanMigo about as well. We have text to speech and speech to text. So students can talk to KhanMigo and have KhanMigo read to them. They can choose between three different voices. KhanMigo also is fluent, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindu, but it can translate into other languages. We just don't say they're fluent, but Khan Academy can be assigned in over 40 different languages. So I want to talk back about learning. Why do I even care learning about this? How many of you, you don't have to like put in the chat or anything, but so don't you think about it? You know somebody who's math anxious talking about students or teachers. Probably a lot of you. You could have a student that is extraordinarily math anxious, or I was a former special ed teacher. So a lot of my students are like, why do I even care? How do, how does learning about equivalent expressions even help me? So what we just did is I just asked, why do I care to KhanMigo said learning about equivalent expressions helps you understand how to simplify and manipulate algebraic expressions. How do you think this might be helpful? Y'all that's what's mainly different about KhanMigo. It is not a chat bot. It is not Google. It's not just going to give kids the answers. We have prompt engineer KhanMigo to be a true learning partner, on demand learning partner that can help. Now with any large language models, prompting is a skill. It's a skill we need to teach students. It's a skill we need to teach teachers, but we have scaffolds in KhanMigo. So we have some sample prompts that students can say like, help me with this or why is this important? But I'm a, this is a lot of what my students would say. Give me the answer. How many of you have students that just want the easy button? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Andrew. So KhanMigo is not going to give the answer. In fact, you see the calculating right now on the screen. That's an additional layer of math AI that we built to minimize math mistakes. KhanMigo was like, listen, I can't give you the answer, but I can help you figure it out. So let's start with this. It will keep prompting students towards the learning, even if you're like, what color is the sky? It'll say, well, great, let's learn. So that's the whole point is we want to focus on learning. Another really great thing that teachers and tutors do is relate the learning to students interest. So how students learn, it needs to be relevant. They need immediate feedback and they have to see that it applies to their life. So maybe I'm a math anxious student, but I love music. So now I can say, explain this to me in terms of music. So now KhanMigo is going to relate the learning to something that I'm interested in. And in fact, there's a place where students can add up to 10 things that they're interested in and they can change it because as we all know, kids change their mind quite frequently, but we want to make sure the learning is relevant for students. So now it's like, great, think of simplifying expressions like creating a musical harmony. Each Z is a note. So I'm like, hold up. What music and algebra, that's like the same thing. So now students will want to learn more. Other guardrails that we have built in is the students type something that is not great because students like to test the boundaries of all new technology. We have something called moderation flags. It's going to stop the conversation. It will alert a teacher. It will alert a leader. And when you log in, you'll have a dot up here knowing that you had some flag conversations. This is how KhanMigo works with Khan Academy content. Any course across all of it, AP bio, grammarly, not grammarly, are granted courses, grammar courses, seventh grade reading, AP, US history, all of it. Then the second hat KhanMigo wears are these learner activities. Now these can be used with any content. It does not have to be Khan Academy content. It can be any content. So when students log in, they see if they were assigned any KhanMigo or Khan Academy content, that's going to be first. If they were assigned any KhanMigo activity, which I'll talk about in a second, that will be down here. They also can see all of these AI activities. They can see their chat history. They also can change the settings and have the voice be a different voice. What are these learner activities? Why are they helpful? Well, the first section is the tutor me section. This is where you have access to that Socratic tutor, that learning conversation with any content. Teachers can assign this to students. A benefit of a teacher assigning any of these activities to students is not only can they track whether or not the student completed it, but you can see the chats a little bit more organized, but you want to be able to track to see if you assign something, what are students doing with that? And teachers can type up to 2000 words in the assignment. So I was working with a science teacher in Western New York and she wanted her students to examine lunar cycles before she taught it. So y'all, this is not Google. It's not like Google 10 facts about the moon. So if you say, help me understand lunar cycles. And again, spelling doesn't matter. What Commigo is going to do is invite me into the conversation. Great. We can explore that. But what do you already know about lunar cycles? As you know, the research says if you can attach new learning to something that you already know, it will stick and you will learn it deeper and faster. So we're trying to bring students into the conversation and have it be like a learning experience, not just like passive. So that is our tutor me section. And the other use case for the tutor me not only can it be one on one, right? I've also seen this happen where you have students working. So I'm working with a small group in my middle school, uh, the LA class. A couple of students are working in other independent groups, but they're stuck. They could have a computer open and they could have Comigo tutor me open. So it's like, ask Commigo before me, you know, before it was like asked three before me. And I was like, I'm going to ask Commigo to help me before, uh, I go and talk to my teacher. The second section practice my knowledge. This is really great for knowledge acquisition, practicing test taking strategies. And we've had some New York educators actually assign New York state assessment items to students to practice with that here. I'm going to come back to writing coach students can debate Commigo on a variety of topics and it's scaffolded, um, middle school, elementary school, high school. They can chat with literary characters and or historical figures. Now this is designed to make learning come alive a little bit more like a lot of times science and social studies teachers are like, well, what's there for me or what can I use this for? World language teachers, you could have a students talk to Macbeth and then you could have students talk to Shakespeare. I've had science teachers assign students to talk to Albert Einstein on thermodynamics. It's designed to make learning come alive more. Another guardrail. These characters will not comment on anything controversial or current. And trust me, I have live pressure tested that in front of state legislatures. Very fun. There's also vocabulary activities where students can practice more academic vocabulary in a gamification environment. And then the final piece down here, this is where students can navigate college and career readiness, including the coaching academic career growth. A lot of New York educators are using a course. I can't remember the name of it now to help even starting a middle school focusing on college and career readiness. So this could be something that you could assign in compliments of that course. I sometimes come here and say like, what do I want to do with my life? Like I know I'm 47, but it's always good to just be like, what do I want to do? Con me go, I don't know. How do I balance passion and the need to make money? These are great questions, y'all. Right. I think we all can answer them. The final piece on the end, and we'll talk about the talk about implementation. When you teach students a new tool, right? Because sometimes we have been working, we've been piloting in some New York schools. They're like, well, the kids don't know how to use it. So I'm going to give you an example of when I was a teacher. I was a sixth grade special ed teacher and I gave my students a highlighter. I did not teach them how to use a highlighter. What do you think happened? Yellow pieces of paper. That's what I got back. You need to teach students how to use the tool. This personalized interest is a great opportunity for students to come engage with Con me go around things that they're interested in. You always want, just like in a math class, you don't just hand students manipulatives and expect them to start using fraction tiles. They're going to build houses first or afford or who knows, but you need to give them play time. This is an opportunity to kind of play with Con me go. All right. That was a lot. Those questions on the student facing resources. Before I go back to the next piece. Questions on this. Oh, great. Rebecca, I'm going to do a whole section on writing coach. I got to, I got to get you excited about it. We got to like anticipate the writing coach piece. Any other questions? So what I will say as a follow up, I am happy to give you all trial codes. If you work at BOCES, we'll be figuring out how to give you access to, we have year long trial codes for component districts. We can give you codes to play with this because I'm finding when I share this, you've got to get in there and play with it yourself. So we'll, we'll share how to, how to do that in a little bit. I now want to talk about teachers. So again, we are talking about learning, showed you how we're trying to build these tools to enhance learning through Khan Academy plus the learner activities. This is the funny part about teaching, but the real reality about teaching is a lot of you have burned out stressed out teachers. A lot of you are struggling to fill teaching positions. A lot of you have teachers who look at AI and are feeling like it's Arnold Schwarzenegger, like Terminator. So there's a lot of diversity and both the needs of teachers, the needs of districts. So we created these AI teacher tools designed to help teachers save them time, do tasks. And I'm really excited because in the fall we have some AI, very specific leader activities too. So these are designed for teachers. Leaders can use these right now, but we're going to tailor a couple of them more for what leaders are using in their work. But the way we've organized this, we have planning, creating, differentiating, supporting, and learning. Now, I know there's a lot of AI teacher tools out there. Like it feels like everyone and their brother has, and you get a teacher tool and everybody gets teacher tools. I just want to point out a little difference with us. We are pulling from Khan Academy content too. So it's not just willy nilly. And I do want to talk about lesson planning first. So we have, I'll just highlight a couple of teacher tools that we have. But even next year, if you use Clever, we're going to have a little bit more integration with some learning management systems so that you'll see here we have light integration with Microsoft, light integration with Google. But I want to talk about the lesson plan because a lot of AI tools have a lesson planner. But how quality is the lesson planner? Can you adjust the lesson plan? Is it going to point back to content that you can use? And the lesson plans, like maybe you are using a core, your core math core ELA, you might want to judge up the lesson or make it more relevant for students. So you can either use Khan Academy content to revise a lesson plan or your own. So I'm going to do one on ratios. And I'm going to provide my own content. Now you can have a five part, four part inquiry based universal design. And then you can decide if you want an outline or high detail. I barely put information in y'all. The more specific you can be with any AI tool, the better it will be. That is universal, whatever AI tool, the more specific, direct. It's all about the prompting. That should be a new song. All about the prompting, about the prompting with AI. Got it? I'm just singing while this is generating. So if as you are evaluating other AI tools, look at the lesson planners. What kind of plans are they generating? What kind of suggestions are they generating? Ours it looks all fancy, right? Lesson objectives, learning activities, direct instruction, guided practice, independent practice. Ours aren't just having teachers be the sage on the stage. It's giving variety of learning opportunities. And even towards the end, we are giving differentiation guides and teacher resources and then pointing it back to Khan Academy content. So we're trying to enhance the learning even in our AI lesson planning tools. And then when you're in your teacher tools, you have Khanmigo over here on the right hand side where you're like, great, I'd love to just tweak this piece. I'd love a multiple choice quiz on this piece. So this is where the tools work with each other. A tool I want to point out, high level. We have a partnership with BlueKit. It's kind of like Kahoot. So you can use Khanmigo to generate some really interesting review questions or preview questions. And then it links into Blookit and becomes like more of a gamification in classrooms. And the last thing we have time for that I want to share is something called class snapshot. So if you are using Khan Academy content, you are so excited and you want to move the needle with your algebra students, your teachers can come here and say, great, Khanmigo, what have my students in algebra 1 been doing in the last seven days? Seven days, y'all. So this is not instant data, but it's helpful to have weekly data. So what this is going to do, it's like, great, here's what my students have been doing. Here's how many minutes they've been in. Maybe they've been other Khan Academy content beyond just the algebra. Then this is where the rubber meets the road. Great, group my students based on these recommendations. How many of your teachers in middle and high school are amazing at small group instruction? Not yet. That's the growth mindset part, right? So now I'm having a group. It would say many groups. So here's where I want to show you the teacher tools for the human element of teaching. We don't just want students on computers all day, every day when they're in school. There's a time for that, but there's a time for this too. So I know that I have a lot of my students need support in solving linear equations. Now I could just assign them this through Khan Academy, but that means that they're on the computer again. Or what I could do is now use the teacher tools. So I'm going to be a little wild and have Friday rotations in my algebra 1 class. So give me a small group station rotations using manipulatives. Yes, I said manipulatives for algebra 1 with a spring theme. So this could actually I could use any theme. Maybe it's Halloween or maybe there's a band that all of my students are excited about. Or maybe I want to talk about algebra 1 and the Civil War. What? That's where AIs nuts. You can totally, that is your creativity. It's unbound. So now I have some station rotations based on this skill. Then I can come here and say, great, I'd love an exit ticket. I'd love to create a multiple choice quiz. Or maybe I want some discussion prompts around this. This is part of the partnership using these tools with Khan Academy content. And the other part, the final part of the partnership, is that teachers have access to chat GPT. Teachers, we're not giving students chat GPT, but teachers have access to this. It's a really great place to start too if you want more outside the box brainstorming for lesson planning. Questions about the teacher tools? Creepy smile at you while I see if there's any questions, because then we're going to talk about writing next. Seven days, how far can it go out with the data compilation? That's a great question, Blake. Oh, Sarah's already answered it. Great. Sarah's on it. Thank you. Yeah, the class snapshot, seven days. If you want to look at more data, there's other places in Khan Academy to see what you've assigned in other data pieces. All right, so now I really just want to talk, zoom in on writing, because we created something that is really amazing. Educators are loving it. That's why we gave it away for free. So the difference between the free version and our district partnership, the free version, it's one teacher assigning something to students. The partnership students can use Writing Coach to write multiple essays too. But I do want to talk about writing for just one second. Did you know the National Commission on Writing recommends students spend 60 minutes a day writing? Do your students spend 60 minutes a day writing? I'm going to say no. I'm just going to say no, because I know the answer. Many students need support. But teacher to student ratios makes that really challenging to have a deep support when it comes to writing. And then the best way for students to really become proficient writers is to get specific, actionable, personalized, and timely feedback. But you are one ELA teacher with 160 kids. Do you have time to do all of that? Not always. So we designed something called Writing Coach, which is an instructional tool. It is not an AI writing checker. It is designed to be very specific on helping students understand how to write academic essays. So it starts with the writing coach. It starts by creating the prompt. So a teacher can create a new assignment. And we have two ways of using Writing Coach. The first way is that you can actually write a essay from scratch. The second would be for students to use Writing Coach to give them feedback on an essay they've already written. Either way, the essay assignment from the teacher is really important, because that's how COM MEGO drives its feedback from. So teachers can create the assignment title, decide which type. Right now, we're supporting fifth through 12th grade. We are supporting persuasive, explanatory, literary analysis, SAT essays, and AP literature essays. And as people give us feedback, we keep adding to this. You can be a specific. You can add up to, oh, I think they even took that out. See, we're always making changes. The more specific you are with the assignment, the better it will be for COM MEGO to be able to give recommendations. And a lot of times, especially if you're doing students writing to a piece of literature, if it's a common literature like Jeremy and Juliet, you don't have to put the actual text in there. But if you want them to comment on a very specific social studies text, you can just cut and paste it right into the assignment. Once you give the assignment, what happens is that students will get the assignment, and then it'll walk them through the process. Let me just show you what this looks like. So now, we start with understanding the prompt. I have, so my teacher assigned this to me. I'm trying to figure out what this is. Oh, wait, COM MEGO is right here on demand for me to help me every step of the way. So maybe I'm explaining the essay type. Or just tell me what I need to do. This is a lot of words in simple terms. So write an essay analyzing who's responsible for the tragedy in Romeo and Juliet. OK, cool, cool, cool. Next, they outline. Students will actually outline in writing coach. But if they get stuck, COM MEGO is there to help. Then they go to drafting. Again, they're writing, write in writing coach. But a guardrail we have is if I'm writing in class and I go home and cut and paste into this, it'll flag it for my teacher. So we're not like an AI cheating detector, but it is flagging for teachers if it's not something that I've written, which is really important. You can also see the assignment. You can see the outline in the chat. And then the revising piece. This is where COM MEGO is going to check the essay against the assignment. And then teachers can see every step of the way whether or not what they completed, how many minutes, if there's any originality flags, all of that. So the teachers have valuable insight and data as students are working through their writing. High level questions about writing coach is very fast. But again, Honor, we have lots of resources for you to keep learning about. But all right. And thank you, Sarah, for answering the question. OK. The last piece we're going to talk about before we talk about the next steps, safe and responsible AI. And especially with the executive order coming out from the White House, all of this talk about AI literacy, what is it? What is it? And how can schools be supported in understanding how to choose the right tool? AI literacy is simply the knowledge, skills, attributes associated with how artificial intelligence, including the principles, concepts, application, as well as how to use it, can be implemented in your school. But understanding the ethics, the implication, the limitations, and things you need to consider before you introduce this wildly new technology in front of students. We at Khan Academy as a nonprofit. So we're doing a lot. And we're pretty tiny. We're a tiny nonprofit considering our reach, which is really exciting. We built this to be safe and responsible, which is why we are keeping the Konemigo student facing tools with our district partnerships so we can have a little bit more guardrails around releasing this amazing tools to students. But we use them in a safe and responsible manner. We've invested in privacy, security, and compliance measures, which is why we have a clean SOC 2 audit. Hopefully you know what that is. But you should be asking companies about that, asking companies about if they're sold, what happens to your data. We've been around for 20 years. We're not going anywhere. We're not like these. There's a lot of new companies popping up, popping up. You read in articles, there's a lot of venture capitalist firms investing in brand new AI companies. What happens to them if they're sold to another bigger ed tech company? What happens to your data? So these are really good questions you should be asking of companies. Do they have guardrails within the product? Like I showed you, we have moderation flags in Konemigo. This is our framework for how we thought about even building these AI tools. We want to make sure we're not building tools to just double down on not great educational practices. How many of you know what FETC is? Future of Education Technology Conference or any SD or any major ed tech worlds? I was in there, I went to FETC in January and I was walking through the exhibit hall. Nice gate, yes, all of those. I felt very overwhelmed with it was technology to make more worksheets or just streamline teacher pay teachers. I was like, whoa, that's a lot. Whereas we really want our tools like I showed you, we pair it with Khan Academy of Mastery Learning System because we want to move the needle with learning. We want these AI tools to help deepen practice, to help you connect more. We built our AI teacher tools so you could do some administer via tasks that might take you a while so you can focus more on the human element of teaching. We're not an advocate of replacing teachers with AI. Sal says it, we say it. We want this to yes and learning, right? So we built it to achieve educational goals. We're starting to build assessments that have AI. We want to make sure that it's equitable, autonomous, privacy, transparency, ethical design, all of these things. So we have a partnership with TeachAI, TeachAI.org. In fact, we don't just have a partnership. We're one of the founding members of TeachAI. We invest energy in the work to build this free tool for districts to be able to understand how to implement. I know many of you are creating AI committees at districts. Many of you at BOCES have AI committees. It's really important to have the right framework and structure. So even our Chief Learning Officer, Kristin Deserbo, who it was so exciting. She's one of Time's 100 influential people around AI. She is on the steering committee of this work. So as a nonprofit, we're so proud to be part of this because it offers free tools for school districts around policy, around capacity, around community and around awareness. So how are you at districts? If you're a component district, how are you thinking through this? As BOCES, how are you thinking through supporting your districts around this? May 22nd, there is a free webinar on the new framework, the 2025 AI framework. You get to hear from global leaders across... It's global, not just the US, too, about how educators are thinking through these AI policies. So this webinar is free. We can put a link. That's one of the links I should have sent, Sarah, but I didn't. You can register for this. We can put it on our New York page, too. Questions about safe and responsible? Oh, thank you, Rebecca. See, Rebecca's on it. She put the TJI.org website. So here's what we covered today. Humans matter. We value humans. We value teachers and leaders and students, which is why we paired our tools to enhance learning, save teachers time, make sure you have the right resources to even try writing across the curriculum, and then we do it all in a safe, responsible way. Because our goal, and I'm so excited to be working deeper with New York State districts and educators, because our goal is how can we use this AI to enhance human intelligence in our buildings? So how do you partner with us? What does this all mean, right? So again, it's the only way to get our student-facing tools. You could use our free teacher tools today. Every teacher in your district can sign up for a free account today and use our teacher tools. You also can use Khan Academy today, but you just don't have what rolls up into the partnership. So it is the only way, though, to get that student-facing AI support within Khan Academy content, as well as the learner activities. Then you get the teacher tools plus chat GPT and the ability to use the tools with Khan Academy content. And we're even working with districts. If you want to just work with your middle school, we can still give all of your teachers K-12 access to the teacher tools to get chat GPT. You also have the courses. So not only do you get the courses automatic rostrum of the courses, you can really come up with very specific ways you're implementing this. And then the courses, you have the AI within the courses. We have all of these great tools, including a digital SAT prep and then service. So Deanna just joined us. You don't know, Wave Deanna, not just joined us, but Deanna joined us too. She's our professional learning specialist for New York. She'll be working with the BOCES trainers. Sarah, Deanna and myself will be working with districts to get implementations up and running. But we support you every step of the way. We're not just leaving you high and dry with these tools because it's a lot. It's a lot. You're like overwhelmed right now and it's only been 49 minutes. The data dashboard to help you track both Khan Academy data as well as Khan Migo data. And then you can use this for a variety of reasons. I know MTSS RTI is really big in New York state. So we'd be happy to talk to you about how you can utilize Khan Academy as a supplement for that. Again, clever class link and responsible implementation of AI. So where I want to finish, round it out is what's next. I hope you saw today that we're not just another AI company popping out of thin air. We value learning. We value educators and students. And I want us to be a partner with your district to help move the needle. Only, I think we're at 40% proficiency in eighth grade math across New York state. Like, are we okay with just 60, like 60% of the students not being on grade level? I don't think so. I know ELA is a huge push. I know foundational reading is a big push, but we want to support your students in closing gaps and your educators doing that in the most efficient, effective way while prioritizing human connection. So how do you partner with us? BOCES, we have, we got you. We'll be working through Sarah Kessler and Michelle's office and Eriwen BOCES to support you with what you need to make sure you're supporting districts in a meaningful way. Everyone else, we have a landing page for you. So we have a New York state landing page where you can see another demo of what I just did, a nine minute demo. You can watch the 60 minutes. You can book time with me to talk through things. So I'm happy to meet with both BOCES as well as component districts. And then we will route you through how to purchase through your BOCES. But I think you've been doing this longer than we have been talking. A lot of you understand how to purchase, but, so the data privacy will be through the TEC Alliance, the tech consortiums. We're really excited about that. And then we'll have steps on how you can sign up for, this is again, the new New York state data privacy agreement that covers ConMigo student facing tools. The teacher tools are available. We already have a data privacy agreement that covers the teacher tools, Con Academy. This is ConMigo. So it's the whole suite is covered by the brand new data privacy agreement. So you'll go, you'll go here. We'll have the, we'll send out the instructions. It's on our landing page, but just know that we are like inches away from having that finalized as well. And then what happens is once you agree, either you've met with me or you, you have watched something through your, your BOCES, you're like, yes, you purchased through the BOCES, then that initiates our partnership. So what will happen is we'll ask you to fill out a form, the districts to fill out a form. You'll connect with Sarah, we'll get you rostered. We'll make sure everything's up and running, and then your accounts will get activated and then we'll move forward with your implementation. So we've been thoughtful about how this is going to work. We cannot wait to work with New York districts. There'll still be some, right now I'm, I have a Northeast learning collaborative webinar series happening this spring. There'll be another one in the fall, like around just more thought leadership. So we'd love to invite you to those to join, to, to learn more from us. So Sarah in the chat, put our New York state landing page as well as the Northeast learning collaborative, but we are very, very close to having everything finalized. We'll make a grand announcement once it is, but I just want to say thank you for being here. Thank you for being in education, honestly. Thank you for being a champion for New York students, New York educators, and I will either give you seven minutes of your life back or seven minutes for questions. So that concludes our official presentation. I appreciate all of you for being here live. What questions do you have? And if not, have a wonderful rest of your day. So we'll just stay on with a creepy smile. If there's any questions. Awesome. Awesome. Rebecca, I'm going to have to muppetize myself. I love. Yeah, I know. I can't wait to meet you too. Yes. And I will, I'll learn how to muppetize myself. Stop the recording. Oh, that's my screen sharing. Not the recording. Anything else?
