So we have right over here, we have the vector u, and we've defined it by giving its x and y components, it's a two dimensional vector, and we have the vector w, and we've graphed them, the vector u, its x component is two, its y component is negative one, so if we put its initial point at the origin, the terminal point, or its head, will be at the point two comma negative one, which is right over there, and for vector w, it's negative five comma five, so its x component is negative five, so if we start at the origin, we would move five to the left, and its y component is positive five, so we would move five up then to get to the head of the vector, or to get to the terminal point. Now given these two vectors, what we wanna do is evaluate what three times the vector u plus 1 5th times the vector w is, and I encourage you to pause the video and give a go at it. Well three and 1 5th are scalers, they are going to scale these vectors, and we're going to see them, see that happen visually, so we're gonna scale up vector u by three, we're gonna scale down vector w, we're gonna multiply it by 1 5th, and then we're gonna add the resulting vectors, so let's do that. So when we scale vector u by three, we could just view this as three times vector u, we know is a vector two comma negative one, and so that's going to be, we could write it this way, we write the two, we write the negative one, that's going to be three times two for the new x component once we scale it up, and three times negative one for the new y component, and of course that's going to be result in the vector three times two, our new x component is six, and our new y component is going to be negative three, and so let's plot that. So everything I've done just now is that part of the expression. So the vector six comma negative three, if we started at the origin, we're going to move, so let's see, we're going to move one, two, three, four, five, six in the x direction, and negative three in the y direction, so one, two, three, one, two, three, so we get right about there. So there you have it. This is the vector three u, we're at one, two, three, four, five, six in the x direction, or six to the right, and then we went down three, one, two, three in the y direction, and notice, it's in the exact same direction as vector u, it just has three times the magnitude, that's vector u, that would be two u, and then we get to three u, three times the magnitude. All right, now let's figure out what 1 fifth times w is. So 1 fifth times w, well, let me just write this, which is going to be plus 1 fifth, w is the vector negative five, comma five, and so this is going to be plus, so it's going to be, let me write the components down, so it's going to be plus 1 fifth times, 1 fifth times negative five, and the y component is going to be 1 fifth times five, and so that's going to be plus, whoops, I wrote 1 half, brain's not working properly, 1 fifth times negative five, and 1 fifth times five, and so this part right over here is going to be 1 fifth times negative five is negative one, and 1 fifth times five is positive one, and so this new vector, 1 fifth w, is going to be w scaled down, and so it's negative one, comma one, if we start it at the origin, so negative one, comma one, we get right over there, and notice, it's going in the same direction as w, it's just 1 fifth, it's just 1 fifth as long, and now we just want to add these two vectors, so if we add them by just looking at its components, the resulting vector, the resulting vector, let me do this in a new color that I have not used yet, so the resulting vector, we're going to add the corresponding x components, so it's going to be six plus negative one, six plus negative one, and the resulting y component is going to be negative three plus one, negative three plus one, and so the resulting vector is going to be equal to five, comma, five, comma, negative two, and we could also see that visually, if we start with this blue vector, three times the vector u, and we were to add the green vector, 1 fifth w, well, if we were to add that, we would just start at the head of three u, when we were going to add negative one, comma, one, so we're going to move one to the left and one up, we're going to get right over there, so let me see if I can draw that, so just doing a little head to tail method right over here, so the head of the first vector is going to be where the tail of the next vector starts that we're adding, and so the resulting vector is going to be, if we started at the tail of the first vector of three u right over here, or at the origin, and then we bring it to the head of the second vector, we get, once again, the vector five, comma, negative two, its x component is five, we move five to the right, and we move two down.
