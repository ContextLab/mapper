        "A": "The missing heritability is likely distributed across many common variants with effects too small to reach genome-wide significance individually, rare variants not well-captured by SNP arrays, gene-gene interactions (epistasis), gene-environment interactions, and structural variants (CNVs, inversions) poorly tagged by standard GWAS chips",

      "options": {
        "A": "Off-target effects are primarily caused by the PAM sequence (NGG for SpCas9) being extremely common throughout the human genome, occurring roughly every eight base pairs on average; the only reliable way to eliminate off-target cleavage is to engineer Cas9 variants that require longer and rarer PAM sequences, thereby reducing the number of potential binding sites across the genome to a manageable level for therapeutic applications",
        "B": "Off-target cleavage occurs at sites with partial guide RNA complementarity — particularly when mismatches are in the PAM-distal region (positions 1-8 of the guide), which contributes less to binding energy. High-fidelity Cas9 variants (e.g., eSpCas9, HiFi Cas9) reduce off-target activity by weakening non-specific DNA contacts so that fewer mismatches are tolerated",
        "C": "Off-target effects arise because Cas9 has an inherent tendency to bind double-stranded RNA transcripts instead of its intended genomic DNA targets, causing widespread unintended cleavage of active mRNA molecules throughout the cell; this fundamental problem can be completely eliminated by switching to DNA-only nucleases that have absolutely no RNA-binding capability or affinity",
        "D": "Off-target editing events occur exclusively within repetitive DNA regions such as Alu elements, LINEs, and SINEs, and are not a meaningful concern in unique single-copy genomic sequences where most therapeutic gene editing targets are located"

        "C": "Polygenic risk scores are designed exclusively for simple monogenic diseases caused by a single high-penetrance variant and cannot be meaningfully applied to complex traits that are influenced by many genetic loci simultaneously, because the mathematical framework underlying PRS calculations assumes single-gene Mendelian inheritance patterns rather than the infinitesimal polygenic model",

      "options": {
        "A": "The t-haplotype produces a broadly cytotoxic poison protein during spermatogenesis that indiscriminately kills all developing sperm cells within the testis — both those carrying the t-haplotype and those carrying the wild-type allele — and then provides a highly specific intracellular antidote molecule only to those sperm cells that carry the t-haplotype genomic region, allowing them to survive and be the sole viable gametes available for fertilization",
        "B": "The t-haplotype causes preferential X-inactivation of the chromosome that bears the competing wild-type alternative allele in female embryos heterozygous for the t-haplotype, resulting in dominant expression of the t-haplotype allele in the majority of somatic cells throughout development, which gives a strong transmission advantage that mimics segregation distortion but operates through an entirely epigenetic mechanism rather than direct gamete competition",
        "C": "The t-haplotype achieves drive through a poison-antidote system acting during spermatogenesis: distorter loci on the t-haplotype produce dominant-negative signaling proteins (the 'poison') that impair flagellar function of all sperm, while a tightly linked responder (Smok1) provides a cis-acting rescue (the 'antidote') only to t-bearing sperm. Fixation is prevented because t/t homozygotes are male-sterile or lethal, creating balancing selection",
        "D": "The t-haplotype replicates itself autonomously within the genome by encoding its own DNA polymerase and replication origin, progressively increasing its copy number in each successive generation through a gene amplification mechanism analogous to how drug-resistance genes become amplified in cancer cells, which creates an ever-growing dosage advantage that overwhelms the wild-type allele through sheer copy number rather than competitive sperm function"

        "B": "Enhancers function by directly looping to contact promoters through 3D chromatin folding mediated by cohesin and Mediator complexes — supported by chromosome conformation capture (3C/4C/Hi-C) data showing enriched contact frequencies between enhancers and their target promoters. Recent evidence from live imaging and perturbation studies suggests that enhancers may also act through a 'hub' or 'condensate' model, where phase-separated transcriptional condensates concentrate transcription factors and coactivators at active loci",
        "C": "Enhancers activate their target genes by physically sliding along the intervening chromatin fiber like a processive scanning enzyme, using ATP hydrolysis to translocate unidirectionally from the enhancer element through all intervening DNA sequences until they physically contact and dock with the target promoter, a process that requires continuous energy input that is proportional to the genomic distance between the enhancer and the gene it regulates and that is completely blocked by any structural barrier inserted between them",
        "D": "Enhancers can only regulate genes located immediately adjacent to them within one kilobase of linear genomic distance, because the transcription factors and coactivators bound to enhancer elements cannot exert any influence on promoters beyond this short range — long-range regulatory effects attributed to distant enhancers are actually mediated by chains of closely spaced intermediate relay elements that sequentially propagate the activation signal along the chromosome from one element to the next until it reaches the target gene"

PARP inhibitors trap PARP1 on DNA at single-strand break repair intermediates, creating replication fork obstacles that generate double-strand breaks during S phase. Normal cells repair these DSBs via HR, but BRCA-deficient cells cannot, forcing them into error-prone repair pathways (like NHEJ or microhomology-mediated end joining) that cause genomic catastrophe and cell death",
        "D": "PARP inhibitors function by completely and irreversibly halting all DNA replication fork progression throughout the genome, preventing S-phase completion entirely in all dividing cells; BRCA-mutant cancer cells are selectively killed because they depend on rapid and continuous cellular division for their proliferative advantage and cannot tolerate even temporary replication arrest, whereas normal cells with intact BRCA can enter a protective quiescent state and resume replication after the drug is cleared from the system"

        "A": "Horizontal gene transfer does not occur in any eukaryotic organisms; all genes found in eukaryotic genomes are exclusively inherited vertically through parent-to-offspring transmission during sexual or asexual reproduction, and any bacterial-like sequences detected in eukaryotic genome assemblies represent contamination artifacts from bacterial DNA that was present in the sequencing library preparation rather than genuine genomic integrations that have been inherited and maintained through evolution",

        "C": "Horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotic organisms occurs exclusively through viral infection events where bacteriophages or eukaryotic viruses serve as vectors that carry bacterial DNA sequences into eukaryotic cells during lytic or lysogenic infection cycles, and it does not involve the direct acquisition of bacterial chromosomal genes through any other mechanism such as transformation, conjugation-like processes, or endosymbiotic gene transfer from organellar genomes to the host nuclear genome",

        "B": "Small populations — random sampling effects are inversely proportional to population size (variance in allele frequency change ∝ 1/2N), so founder effects, bottlenecks, and small isolated populations experience the largest random fluctuations, potentially fixing deleterious alleles or losing beneficial ones through chance alone",

Template switching uses the undamaged sister chromatid as an alternative template, achieving error-free bypass through a recombination-like mechanism",

        "C": "Neither translesion synthesis nor template switching exists as a biological mechanism — cells have absolutely no capacity to tolerate or bypass DNA damage during replication and always undergo cell death when lesions block the replication fork, which contradicts the well-documented damage tolerance pathways regulated by PCNA ubiquitination that enable cell survival in the presence of replication-blocking lesions",
