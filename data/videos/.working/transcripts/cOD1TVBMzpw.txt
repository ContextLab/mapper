My goal is to get my kids to believe in themselves. Every Friday on our agenda I said 330 celebrations. I got you! Oh yeah! Whether it's word lists that are mastered, whether it's our multiplication, we're going to find something to celebrate. The kids master these skills, they earn these points, they show proficiency with the standards. Learning happens. Even if you are a struggling kid, every point, every second, every video you watch, every effort you make, all goes to a class total. Everybody in their struggles gets to participate. When we got those 10 million points, I had a girl hold the key and run. I had balloons filled with confetti, so I'm going around popping these balloons. She's holding my phone and it's like taking a selfie in an earthquake kind of thing. When you just see this classroom come together and unite among that, it's awesome.
