The number of mosquitoes in millions, m, so m is the number of mosquitoes in millions in Brooklyn, New York. It depends on the June rainfall in centimeters, r. So r is the amount of rainfall measured in centimeters. And it can be modeled by the function m, so the number of mosquitoes in millions, is equal to negative r times r minus four, where r, once again, is the rainfall in centimeters, I guess, in June. All right, fair enough. Now let's see if we can answer these questions. And like always, I encourage you to get inspired and try to answer these questions on your own. All right, the first one. How many centimeters of rainfall will there be, after how many centimeters of rainfall, will there be a population of zero million mosquitoes? Or will there be just no mosquitoes, zero mosquitoes? Well, let's just rewrite this function. So our population of mosquitoes, it actually just helps my brain to rewrite it, to kind of process what's going on. My population of mosquitoes in millions is going to be negative r times r minus four, where r is the number of centimeters of rainfall. So in order to have a zero million population, so that means m is going to have to be equal to zero. So we need to figure out at what r's, at what r's is m equal to zero. So we just have to solve this right over here. Well, in order for this expression right over here to be equal to zero, notice it's a product of two expressions. We are multiplying, you could view it as, we're multiplying negative r times r minus four. Let me do r minus four in a different color. Times r minus four. So if you're multiplying two expressions and you get zero, one or both of them need to be equal to zero. So let's see how that happens. So either negative r is going to be equal to zero, negative r is equal to zero, or, or, or you're going to have r minus four is equal to zero. Or r minus four is equal to zero. So how does negative r equal zero? Well, you divide both sides by negative one, or multiply both sides by negative one, you get r would need to be equal to zero. How does r minus four equal zero? Well, you add four to both sides, you see that r would have to be equal to four. So it either is no rainfall, zero centimeters of rainfall, or four centimeters of rainfall, you get a population of zero mosquitoes. Now, why does that, let's just think about whether that makes sense, whether this is a good model for, for the number of mosquitoes. Well, we always imagine mosquitoes need some standing water. So if you have no rainfall, there's not going to be any place for them to breed. There's not going to be any standing water, maybe. And this way, this model seems, it's like, well, if you have enough rainfall, so some rain is going to help the mosquitoes breed, but then if you have enough rainfall, they're just going to get, I guess, washed out some ways. I guess raindrops are going to hit them as they fly. I don't know what the, what, what, what's actually happening at the mosquito scale, but it's implying that if there's a lot of rainfall, it would actually be hard. I guess you don't have standing water anymore. The water is moving around and it's overflowing and it's going into the gutter and whatever else, it would make it very hard for the mosquitoes to breed. What is the maximum possible number of mosquitoes? So the very idea that they're asking a maximum implies that this quadratic over here, and it is a quadratic, and we'll see that more clearly in a few seconds, is shaped like this in order to have a maximum point, because if it was shaped like this, it wouldn't, it would have a minimum point, it wouldn't have any one maximum. And because we have this negative out here, it makes us pretty confident it is going to be a downward opening parabola. But to understand what this maximum point is, let's write it in vertex form. And just as a reminder what vertex form would be, it would be writing into the form of M is equal to A times, let me see, R minus B squared plus C. This right over here would be vertex form and it's very useful because you get a sense of when you hit a minimum or maximum point. If this thing right over here is negative, then the maximum value, because this thing can only be non-positive, the maximum value would be this and then we could figure out when does this equal zero and that's when you hit that maximum value. And if any of this seems foreign, I encourage you to watch the videos on vertex form. And I'm about to complete the square on this character in order to get here, so I encourage you to also watch the videos on completing the square. So let's do that. So let's start with this expression. And I'm gonna start by, actually let's start by, I'm gonna just distribute the R. So if you have M is equal to, I'm gonna keep the negative out front, but I'm gonna distribute the R. R times R is R squared. R times negative four is minus four R. And I wanna complete the square. And once again I encourage you to watch those videos if what I'm about to do seems like voodoo. But to complete the square I wanna add and subtract the same thing. I don't wanna actually change the value of the expression. And so I'll look at this coefficient, this first degree coefficient here. It's negative four. Half of that is negative two. If I square it, I wanna add four. I want to add four. I want to add, excuse me, let me make it a different color. I want to add four. Now once again, I can't just go around adding numbers to expressions and assuming the equality still holds. I have to add and subtract the same thing. Well you might be tempted to write a minus four out here because hey I added four and then I subtract four. But remember when I add this four in this parentheses, I have this negative out front. If I were to distribute this negative, I essentially, this is a minus four. So if I wanted to add them out to be zero, distribute this negative, this would be a negative four. If I wanted to cancel out this, this needs to be a positive four. So once again, when you look superficially, it looks like I just added four twice, but I didn't. This right over here since it has this negative sign is a negative four. Negative four plus four is zero. I have not changed the value of this expression. But anyway, now that I've done that, this piece right over here, the whole reason why I added four is to make it a perfect square. This is now the same thing as r minus two, r minus two squared. I have the negative out front. We have m equals negative r minus two squared plus four. Plus four. And just like that, I've written it in vertex form. So what's the maximum number of mosquitoes? Well, let's just look at this, the structure of this expression a little bit. This piece, this piece right over here, that thing, actually, let me not do it in the same color as the four. Let me do it in this orangeish color. This piece right over here is always going to be less than or equal to zero. So that's always going to be less than or equal to zero. It's always going to be non-positive. So this whole expression hits a maximum value when this thing is zero. Because at any other point, it's going to just take away from this right over here. So you hit a maximum value when this is equal to zero, when negative r minus two squared is equal to zero. Well, that's going to happen when, well, you could see when r minus two is equal to zero or when r is equal to two. And when r is equal to two, what is m going to be equal to? Well, when r is equal to two, this is zero. And m is equal to four. r equals two and m is equal to four. So what's the maximum possible number of mosquitoes? Well, m equals four. It's going to be four million mosquitoes. Remember, m is measuring in millions, four million mosquitoes. And then they ask us, after how many centimeters of rainfall will the maximum number of mosquitoes occur? Well, we figured it out. After two centimeters of rainfall. So if we go back to our model, at zero rainfall, you have no mosquitoes. Then as it rains more and more, you have more and more mosquitoes. I guess more and more standing water. You have a maximum number of mosquitoes at two centimeters of rainfall. At two centimeters, we have four million mosquitoes. But then after that, I guess the rain starts washing away the mosquito eggs or something. And you start having fewer and fewer mosquitoes all the way until you get to four centimeters of rainfall. And I guess after four centimeters of rainfall, in theory, you have negative mosquitoes, I guess. I don't know what that would mean. And that might just be a situation where the model just breaks down. Obviously, I don't know what negative million mosquitoes would actually mean. The relevant area where this model should hold is between zero centimeters of rainfall and four centimeters. Because after that, the model starts describing negative values for m. So anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.
