The number B is 5 less than twice the number C. Let me write that down. So B is equal to 5 less than twice the number C. So that's 2 times C minus 5. It's 5 less than 2 times the number C. The product of B and C is 45. So I could write that as B times C is equal to 45. Which of the following pairs of equations could be used to find the values of B and C? So let's see. So this one we have 45 is equal to BC, 45 is equal to BC. So these are contenders. This one has 45. 45C is equal to B. Well that's like this is a different equation. If you divided both sides by C, you'd have 45 is equal to B over C. So we can knock this one out. This one has 45C is equal to B. Well once again, 45C equals B. We can knock that one out. This one has 45 is equal to BC. So now we can just focus on the first of these equations. So let's see. B is equal to 2 minus 5C. No, it should be 2C minus 5. So we can knock that one out. B is equal to 2C minus 5. Well that's exactly what I wrote here. BC is equal to 45. That's exactly what I wrote here. Wrote over here. So this is going to be our choice. And we can verify that this last one isn't going to work. B is equal to 2 times C plus 5. Well if we distribute the 2, that's like saying that B is equal to 2C plus 10, which is clearly different than this first equation that I wrote up here. So we can knock that out as well.
