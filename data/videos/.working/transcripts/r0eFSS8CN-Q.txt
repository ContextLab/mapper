Find the natural log of three using a calculator round your answer to the nearest hundredth. And just as a reminder, natural log of three, this is just another way of saying log base e of three. Or what power do I have to raise e to to get to three? And three is a little bit larger than e. E is 2.71 and it goes on and on and on. So three is a little bit larger than e, so I'm guessing it's going to be one point something something. So let's get our calculator out and just calculate it. So natural log, that's this button right over here, LN. I'm assuming it's maybe from French log natural or something like that. So natural log of three is one point and what they want us to round to the nearest hundredth. So it's 1.09, but the thousands place is an eight, which is greater than or equal to five. So we want to round up. So we want to round the nine up, but that essentially takes us to 10. So 1.10. So this is approximately equal to 1.10 when we round to the nearest hundredth.
