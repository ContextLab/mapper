We're asked to convert 10 to the second power, or 10 squared equals 100, into a logarithmic equation. Now this is saying if I take the base 10, so let me do 10 in yellow, I take the base 10 to the exponent 2, then I get 100. When you do a logarithm, it's really kind of the inverse of that. It's really kind of the other way of thinking about it. A logarithm says, what power do I have to raise the base to to get 100? So if I were to write log base 10 of 100, and I wrote the 10 a little bit bigger than it's typically done, and let me write it this way, log base 10 of 100, this says what power do I have to raise 10 to my base to get 100? We know from this, and actually you probably knew even if we didn't have this written down, you would have to raise it to the second power. This is equal to 2. Right over here we're saying in an exponential equation, the base 10 to the second power is equal to 100. Here in the logarithmic equation, we're saying the power that we have to raise 10 to to get 100 is equal to 2. So these are really saying the exact same thing. And just so you get the terminology right, this in both cases, the 10 is referred to as the base. And in both cases, the 2 is referred to, and I think you know this already, as the exponent. And then the 100 is what you get when you raise the base to the exponent. So these are both two ways of writing the exact same truth about 10 to the second power, equaling 100.
