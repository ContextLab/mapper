Let's get a class snapshot of how my students are progressing in their Algebra I course. ConMigo, could you please give me a class snapshot of my Algebra I students? With one click of the button, ConMigo can give me a high-level overview of my students' performance for the past seven days. ConMigo then gives me the option to see which students should be celebrated for working on their assignments. It'll give me a list of students who are above 25% on their course mastery goal. It allows me to group my class into three groups based on their progress for the week, and it also lets me see who needs a check-in about their skills progress for that week. Now, I know I love to celebrate my students, and that's one of my favorite things, so that's the one that I'm going to select. And as much as I love celebrating my students, ConMigo knows it's important to look at all of my students, especially the ones who may be struggling or stuck. ConMigo suggests that I view my students' assignment scores report, and ConMigo also provides the link for me so it's easily accessible. I noticed that several of my students are struggling with solving systems of equations, which honestly is not my favorite thing to teach, but not to worry, I have my teaching assistant. You can chat with ConMigo anytime while you're logged into your Con Academy account. It can help you navigate the site, find engaging content for your students, and can even give you tips on teaching. ConMigo, what should the objectives be for systems of equations, and can you recommend an activity for my students? Wonderful! ConMigo, can you provide a video that I can assign to my students for this lesson? Perfect! Thank you for providing the link also, ConMigo. Thank you! This is great! And from the screen, I can easily assign this lesson to my students. Thanks, ConMigo! One last thing. Looking at my students' report, I noticed that Jason is really struggling, and you did give me a heads up about that, so I was wondering, could you please help me draft a progress report for him that I can send home to his family? This is great, ConMigo! Thank you! Actually, ConMigo, Jason's mom speaks Spanish. Could you please translate this letter for me? This is wonderful! Thank you so much, ConMigo! ConMigo's insights and suggestions are going to enhance classroom learning and make teachers' lives easier by saving them time so they'll have the ability to focus on what's important – their students.
