A sequence is defined recursively as follows. So a sub n is equal to a sub n minus 1 times a sub n minus 2. Or another way of thinking about it, the nth term is equal to the n minus 1th term times the n minus 2th term with the 0th term, where a sub 0 is equal to 2 and a sub 1 is equal to 3. Find a sub 4. So let's write this down. So they're telling us a sub 0 is equal to 2. And they also tell us that a sub 1 is equal to 3. So they've kind of given us our starting conditions, or our base conditions. Now we can think about what a sub 2 is. And they tell us that a sub 2 is going to be a sub 2 minus 1. So that's a sub 1. It's a sub 1 times a sub 2 minus 2. That's a sub 0. So a times a sub 0. And they already told us what a sub 1 and a sub 0 is. This thing is 3. This thing is 2. So it's 3 times 2, which is equal to 6. Now let's move on to a sub 3. So a sub 3 is going to be the product of the previous two terms. So it's going to be a sub 2. 3 minus 1 is 2. 3 minus 2 is 1. So it's a sub 2 times a sub 1. So it's equal to 6 times 3, which is equal to 18. And then finally, a sub 4, which I will do in the color that I'll use it. I'll do it in yellow. a sub 4 is going to be equal to a sub 3 times a sub 2. So 4 minus 1 is 3. 4 minus 2 is 2. So times a sub 2. Times a, within that blue color, times a sub 2, which is equal to 18 times 6. Which is equal to, let's see, 6 times 8 is 48. Plus 6 times 10 is 100 and 108. And we're done. a sub 4 is equal to 108.
