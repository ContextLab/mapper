Find log of 34 using a calculator. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth. So someone just asks you the log of 34. If you see this like this, you might say, what's the base? If they don't include a base here, and they use the word log, the implicit base is base 10. So this is the same thing as log base 10 of 34, which is essentially saying the power that I have to raise 10 to to get to 34. And if I take 10 to the first power, I get 10. And 10 to the second power is going to be 100. 34 is between 10 and 100. So it's going to be someplace in between 1 and 2, the power that I have to raise 10 to get to 34. But we are allowed to use a calculator. So let's use a calculator. And then we're going to round to the nearest hundredth. So let me get my TI 85 out. And it's going to be a little different, depending on the calculator used. But on most of the TI graphing calculators, you see this log button right over here. And so that is base 10. You don't see that little 10 subscript right over here. But when you just see a log, that assumes base 10. So if I write log of 34, this is the power I need to raise 10 to to get to 34. And that gets us to one point. We were after round to the hundredths. 1.53, the thousands place is a 1. So we do round down. So 1.53. So this is equal to, I should say, maybe say approximately equal to 1.53. And we're done.
