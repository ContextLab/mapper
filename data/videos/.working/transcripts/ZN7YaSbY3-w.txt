Let's say that I have the vector, actually let me give it the vector a, and let's say that it is equal to two, one. So we could draw it right over here. So it's equal to two, one. So if we were to start at the origin, we would move two in the horizontal direction and one in the vertical direction. So we would end up right over here. Now what I wanna do is think about how we can define multiplying this vector by a scalar. So for example, if I were to say, if I were to say three times, three times the vector a, which is the same thing as saying three times two, one. So three is just a number. One way to think about a scalar quantity, it is just a number versus a vector. This is giving you, it's giving you how much you're moving in the various directions right over here. So this is giving you both a magnitude, magnitude and a direction. Well this is just a plain number right over here. But how would we define multiplying three times this vector right over here? Well one reasonable thing that might jump out at you is well why don't we just multiply the three times each of these components? So this could be equal to, so we have two and one. And we're gonna multiply each of these times three. So three times two and three times one. And then the resulting vector is still going to be a two dimensional vector. And it's going to be the two dimensional vector six, three. Now I encourage you to get some graph paper out and to actually plot this vector and think about how it relates to this vector right over here. So let me do that. So the vector six, three, if we started at the origin, we would move six in the horizontal direction. One, two, three, four, five, six, and three in the vertical. One, two, three. So it gets us right over there. So it would look like this. So what just happened to this vector? Well notice, one way to think about it is what's changed and what has not changed about this vector? Well what's not changed is still pointing in the same direction. So this right over here has the same direction. Multiplying by the scalar, at least the way we defined it, did not change the direction that my vector is going in. Or at least in this case it didn't. But it did change its magnitude. Its magnitude is now three times longer, which makes sense because we multiplied it by three. One way to think about it is we scaled it up by three. The scalar scaled up the vector. That might make sense or might give an intuition of where that word scalar came from. The scalar can, when you multiply it, it scales up. It increased its magnitude by three without changing its direction. But let's do something interesting. Let's multiply our vector a. Let's now multiply it by a negative number. Let's actually just multiply it by negative one, just for simplicity. So let's just multiply negative one times a. Well using the convention that we just came up with, we would multiply each of the components by negative one. So two times negative one is negative two. And one times negative one is negative one. So now negative one times a is going to be negative two, negative one. So if we started at the origin, we would move in the horizontal direction, negative two, and in the vertical direction, negative one. So now what happened to the vector? Now what happened to the vector when I did that? Well now it flipped its direction, multiplying it by this negative one. It flipped its direction. Its magnitude actually has not changed. But its direction is now in the exact opposite direction, which makes sense that multiplying by a negative number would do that. In fact, when we just dealt with the traditional number line, that's what happened. If you took five times negative one, well now you're going in the other direction. You're at negative five. You're five to the left of zero. So it makes sense that this would flip its direction. So you could imagine if you were to take something like negative two times your vector a, negative two times your vector a. I encourage you to pause this video and try this on your own. What would this give and what would be the resulting visualization of the vector? Well let's see. This would be equal to negative two times two is negative four. Negative two times one is negative two. So this vector, if you were to start at the origin, remember you don't have to start at the origin, but if you were, it would be, so you'd go zero, one, two, three, four, one, two. It looks just like this. And so just to remind ourselves, our original vector a look like this. And then when you multiply it by negative two, you get a vector that looks like this. You get a vector that looks like this. Let me draw it like this. And purposely not having them all start at the origin, because they don't have to all start at the origin. But you get a vector that looks like this. So what's the difference between a and negative two times a? Well the negative flipped it over, and then the two flipped it over, and now it has twice the magnitude. But because of the negative, it has twice the magnitude in the other direction.
