I'm here again with Dan Russell and that last one was too easy. Shortest US president, we found it in like two seconds. That's right. So give me something harder. Okay, let's try a more difficult question where you're comparing, say, the population growth of two countries. So let's look at, for example, the population growth over the past five years of India versus the United States. India versus... So you want me to answer, I guess, just find out how they grow or compare... Yeah, exactly. Which has had the highest rate of growth over the past five years? I would guess it's India, but we'll see by how much. Population growth, I would write US versus India. Okay, that's a reasonable search. All right. US versus future fertility and immigration may play major roles in the nation's growth. Let's see. Now look at that. As we were talking about last time, that's what? That's scribed. Scribed. Would you believe a result from scribed or not? I don't know. I'm actually not so web survey. Okay. Scribed like a well-known site. It's a pretty well-known site. Oh, it is? Okay. So maybe it is. Is it like a crowd source type of thing? Yeah. Okay, so let's see. Okay, so this is some kind of like presentation by someone. That's what scribed does. Oh, they allow you to put your presentation on? Oh, that's useful. India's estimated population would be 1.2 billion by 2010. India became the second country in the world after China crossed 1 billion. The sex ratio, number of females per thousand males, published with 933. Okay. Okay. All right. Two other categories. Okay, you can look here now for quite a while. We need something more dense. Yeah, I'm feeling like I'm hitting a... Yeah, I mean it might be in here someplace, but this doesn't seem like it. So it's an important point for doing these kinds of searches. Yeah, to be able to... You don't want to get stuck in a rat hole. You want to be able to sort of... You know someone's collected this information. You just need to find it. Yeah, effects of growing populations, comparing population growth. That looks good. That looks great. It's by a set visualizing economics. Sounds like what you want. It looks like a legitimate site, I don't know, you know, and she even has a legitimate name. Catherine Mulbrandon sounds very authoritative. Sounds professional. Yes. All right. Let's see. So this looks pretty good. Wait, let me see. Let me get rid of this little thing that's popping up. Okay, so what is this? Is population growth over the last 500 years? Okay, so this might not be as granular as we're hoping. Okay, it's an interesting point. Now you need not just the information, but the kind of information you're looking for. Yeah, so over 500 years it does... And this is actually just giving the absolute numbers. So we're really concerned more with almost the slope of this line. That's right. More than the percentage slope. And you can kind of eyeball it and see that the U.S. is growing a little slower than India. But it would be nice to have the resolution to actually tell. Right, right. And actually percentage... Because percentage is slightly different than slope. And this is actually only until 2000. Right. This is only until 2000. So I mean the simple answer, we're getting hints that it probably is what we thought it was, that India is growing faster. So at this point I'd go back and try another result. Yeah. Let's see. Extra growth. China versus India. So maybe I could just do them separately. Okay. So population... That's actually an excellent idea. Because sometimes it's easier to find a single piece of data. Yeah. And then collect that and then compare it with the other single piece of data. Yeah. It would have been awesome if someone happened to write like a treatise on the population growth of... And we have the Wikipedia article about the demographics of India. That sounds like it's going to give you the answer. Let's see. Don't help me too much. Okay. So India's estimated 1.41% growth rate in 2009. That's right. Alright. So maybe we can at least... Maybe the U.S. one will have the same... Yeah. Look up demographics of... So it's kind of a search within Wikipedia. That's right. Let's really mix it up. That's a good point. Wikipedia has its own search. So you never have to leave Wikipedia. There are reasons why you sometimes want to do that. The United States. Actually we're in demographics. But maybe they are. Let's see what it does. Demographics of the United States. You got what you wanted. Yeah. Okay. So let's see. But it's not the same identical article. So they didn't write. Okay. So I'll just remember that. It was 1.4% for... And now in fairness of being search agnostic, I was doing a little bit of Bing. Let me do a little bit of Google now. Let's try that. Alright. So let me do... So let me think... Okay. So U.S. population growth. That's at 1.4 in 2000. So I wanted to point out one thing real quick. Back up just a little bit in your query. Go all the way back to population. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Okay. Now stop. You see the graph right there at the very top? Yes. So population of the United States. Click on that. And what you should end up is in the Google Public Data Explorer. Oh, yes. Yes. And this is exactly the graph we were looking for for the United States. If you look on the left-hand side, which you should always check because there's often useful things there, you might be able to change, for example, the U.S. here. This is within the United States. Yeah. But I'm willing to bet, since we've got this public data stuff, that you could compare India versus the U.S. Okay. So this is all within the U.S. I mean, if I click chart needs more information. Population of the U.S. How do I navigate this? Click up there. Yeah. Public data. All right. Public data. Oh, this is neat. This is like the Hans Rosling type of data. Exactly. Exactly. This is all lots of different kinds of collected data. Okay. And so what you want is something about world population. So these are the sources. That's the sources. So the World Resources Institute sounds like someone who would have world data. That's what I would click on first. World data. Okay. But now we've got greenhouse gases and emissions. Yeah. No, no, no. That's not. So metrics would be more useful. Metrics. As opposed to where, you know, so let's see OECD fact. Yeah. Or World Economic Forum. Okay. One of those things. Yeah. Oh, but this isn't actually going to plot it for us. Well, once we go inside the data, that's what it does. This is public data that's collected and allows you to visualize it. Okay. With either the line graph like we saw before or with like the Hans Rosling. Yeah. Double chart. Yeah. But this, for me, this seems, I kind of feel like going back to the searches. Okay. Let's go back to the search. This is kind of, I feel like I could dig in there for a long time and the search seemed more. Or you could click right there on that search tab and then I'll take you right back to Google. Yeah. There you go. So if we go US population, population growth by year, that looks pretty good. Because then we could, so this is the NPG. What is the NPG? The NPG, well, we'll figure that out in a second. But this is good. Percent change. Right. And then this is by year. Oh, this only goes up to 1998. So, I mean, it's probably not that different, but we could, you know, it's lower than India's, which is 1.4% in 2009 estimated. That's right. But let's see if we can get something for our viewers. So let me look up, let me put 2009 there. 2009. And you're at usnews.com. I mean, that seems like a legitimate site. Estimate. Okay. So here you go. We have all the numbers we need to figure out. The percentage. Population added since January 1, 2008. And then, so this is what added over, I guess this is added over 2008. Right. So you could do the math at this point. Yes. You know, you might also try modifying the query and add, for example, the word percentage. Yes. So I don't have to do the math. Right. Percentage. Percentage. Let's see. US population growth is among the highest. And this is an interesting article. Right. So I could just search, let me search within in that. So I'll do a Control F to search within there. So what is it? What is it? Population. Growth. Okay. Since the vast majority have, okay. The US shows population increases of 0.91% for the 12 month periods ending July 2011. So that's pretty good. I mean, to answer your question, I think we're feeling pretty good. India is above 1%. The US is below 1%. By a lot. That's right. So we're, and as we know from compounding interest. Exactly. On a higher base. It's a huge difference over many, many, over 10 years. You take them to the 10th power, that becomes a much bigger, absolute, very good. Well, yeah, this was a little bit more challenging. But I think we found the answer. I want you to really stump me in the next video. Okay. We'll do that.
