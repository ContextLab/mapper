Now that you've learned a thing or two about significant figures, I want to use this video to make sure that you don't overdo it in situations where it might be disastrous. And to give you an example there, let's say that I were to tell you that someone or something, I don't know, let's say something is 112 centimeters. Actually, let's make it interesting. 112.2 centimeters long, some object. So there's some object. It's 112.2 centimeters long. You're able to measure to the nearest tenth of a centimeter of how long it is. And then someone were to ask you, well, how long would five of these objects be? So let me write that down. How long would five of these objects end to end? How long would that be? So you have one object, you put another object, three objects, four objects, five objects. How long would this be? And so before we even talked about significant figures, you would just say, well, it's 112.2 times 5. So let's multiply that out. 112.2 times 5. 5 times 2 is 10. Carry, or I guess you could say regroup the 1. 2 times 5 is 10, plus 1 is 11. 1 times 5 is 5, plus 1 is 6. 1 times 5 is 5. And we have one number behind the decimal, so we get 561.0. And so there's something interesting here. So let me rewrite it. We have 112.2 times 5, and we get 561.0. And this was in centimeters, and then this is going to be in centimeters as well. And now all of a sudden, let's care about the significant figures. So right over here, in this measurement, you had 1, 2, 3, 4 significant figures. But there might be a temptation for you to say, wait, I'm multiplying that by something that only has one significant figure. 5 is only one significant figure. So shouldn't my answer only have one significant figure? And that would be completely wrong. That would be a disaster. And the reason why is that you shouldn't count the 5 when you're calculating significant figures, because this was not a measurement. This is a pure number. This is, you could have written 5.0000000. We're taking exactly five of these objects and putting them next to each other. This isn't some approximation, some measurement. So this is an infinite precision. So this doesn't affect the significant figure calculation. It is a pure number. You're saying exactly five. So in this situation, you once again just look at the measurements. And there's only one measurement here that has four significant figures. So our product in this case should have four significant figures. So our product, actually the way we wrote it right here, actually does have four significant figures. So this would be a completely legitimate thing to write down, and that's because this has infinite precision. It is a pure, pure number.
