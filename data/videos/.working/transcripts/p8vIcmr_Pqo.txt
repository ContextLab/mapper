The first time you're exposed to permutations and combinations, it takes a little bit to get your brain around it, so I think it never hurts to do as many examples, but each incremental example, I'm gonna review what we've done before, but hopefully go a little bit further. So let's just take another example, and this is in the same vein. In videos after this, I'll start using other examples other than just people sitting in chairs, but let's stick with it for now. So let's say we have six people again. So person A, B, C, D, E, and F. So we have six people. And now let's put them into four chairs. We can go through this fairly quickly. One, two, three, four chairs. And we've seen this show multiple times. How many ways, how many permutations are there of putting these six people into four chairs? Well, the first chair, if we seat them in order, we might as well. We could say, well, there'd be six possibilities here. Now for each of those six possibilities, there'd be five possibilities of who we put here because one person's already sitting down. Now for each of these 30 possibilities of seating these first two people, there'd be four possibilities of who we put in chair number three. And then for each of these, what is this, 120 possibilities, there would be three possibilities of who we put in chair four. And so this six times four times, six times five times four times three is the number of permutations. And we've seen in one of the early videos on permutations that, or when we talk about the permutation formula, one way to write this, if we wanted to write it in terms of factorial, we could write this as, six factorial, six factorial, which is going to be equal to six times five times four times three times two times one. But we want to get rid of the two times one. So we're gonna divide that. We're gonna divide that. Now what's two times one? Well, two times one is two factorial, and where did we get that? Well, we wanted the first four factors of six factorial. So if you want, and that's where the four came from, we wanted the first four factors. And so the way we got two is we said six minus four. Six minus four, that's going to get us what we want to get, that's going to give us the number that we want to get rid of. So we wanted to get rid of two, or the factors we want to get rid of. So that's going to give us two factorial. So if we use six minus four factorial, then that's going to give us two factorial, which is two times one, and then these cancel out, and we are all set. And so this is one way, I put in the particular numbers here, but this is a review of the permutations formula, where people say, hey, if I'm saying n, if I'm taking n things and I want to figure out how many permutations are there, putting them into, let's say, k spots, it's going to be equal to n factorial over n minus k factorial. That's exactly what we did over here, where six is n, and k, or four is k. Four is k, actually, let me color code the whole thing so that we see the parallel. Now all of that is review, but then we went into the world of combinations. And in the world of combinations, we said, okay, permutations make a difference between who's sitting in what chair. So for example, in the permutations world, and this is all review, we've covered this in the first combinations video. In the permutations world, A, B, C, D, and D, A, B, C, these would be two different permutations. This being counted in whatever number this is. This is what, this is 30 times 12. This is equal to 360. So this is, each of these, this is one permutation, this is another permutation, and if we keep doing it, we would count up to 360. But we learned in combinations, when we're thinking about combinations, let me write combinations. So if we're saying n choose, n choose k, or how many combinations are there? If we take k things, and we just wanna figure out how many combinations, sorry, if we start with n, if we have pool of n things, and we wanna say how many combinations of k things are there, then we would count these as the same combination. So what we really wanna do is we wanna take the number of permutations there are. We wanna take the number of permutations there are, which is equal to n factorial over n minus k factorial, over n minus k factorial. And we wanna divide by the number of ways that you could arrange for people. Once again, and this takes, I remember the first time I learned it, it took my brain a little while. So if it's taking a little while to think about it, not a big deal. It can be confusing at first, but it'll, if you keep thinking about it, hopefully, you will see clarity at some moment. But what we wanna do is we wanna divide by all of the ways that you could arrange for things. Because once again, in the permutations, it's counting all of the different arrangements of four things, but we don't wanna count all of those different arrangements of four things. We wanna just say, well, they're all one combination. So we wanna divide by the number of ways to arrange for things. Now, or the number of ways to arrange k things. So let me write this down. So what is the number of ways, number of ways to arrange k things, k things in k spots? And I encourage you to pause the video because this is actually a review from the first permutation video. Well, if you have k spots, let me do it. So this is the first spot, the second spot, third spot, and then you're gonna go all the way to the kth spot. Well, for the first spot, there could be k possibilities. There's k things that could take the first spot. Now, for each of those k possibilities, how many things could be in the second spot? Well, it's gonna be k minus one because you already put something in the first spot. And then over here, what's it gonna be? k minus two all the way to the last spot. There's only one thing that could be put in the last spot. So what is this thing here? k times k minus one times k minus two times k minus three all the way down to one. Well, this is just equal to k factorial. The number of ways to arrange k things in k spots, k factorial, the number of ways to arrange four things in four spots, that's four factorial. The number of ways to arrange three things in three spots, it's three factorial. So we could just divide this by k factorial. And so this would get us, this would get us n factorial divided by k factorial, k factorial times n minus k factorial. n minus k and minus k, and I'll put the factorial right over there. And this right over here is the formula. This right over here is the formula for combination. Sometimes this is also called the binomial coefficient. People will call this n choose k. They'll also write it like this. n choose k, especially when they're thinking in terms of binomial coefficients. But I got into kind of an abstract tangent here when I started getting into the general formula. But let's go back to our example. So in our example, we saw there was 360 ways of seating six people into four chairs. But what if we didn't care about who's sitting in which chairs and we just want to say, how many ways are there to choose four people from a pool of six? Well that would be, that would be how many ways are there. So that would be six, how many combinations, if I'm starting with a pool of six, how many combinations are there? How many combinations are there for selecting four? Or another way of thinking about it is, how many ways are there to, from a pool of six items, people in this example, how many ways are there to choose four of them? And that is going to be, you know, we could do it, you know, well, I'll apply the formula first and then I'll reason through it. And like I always say, I don't, I'm not a huge fan of the formula. Every time I, you know, I revisit it after a few years, I actually just re-think about it as opposed to memorizing it, because memorizing is a good way to not understand what's actually going on. But if we just apply the formula here, but I really want you to understand what's happening with the formula, it would be six factorial over four factorial, over four factorial times six minus four factorial. Six, whoops, let me actually, let me just, so this is six minus four factorial, this part right over here, six minus four fact, actually, let me write it out, because I know this can be a little bit confusing the first time you see it. So six minus four factorial, factorial, which is equal to six factorial over four factorial, over four factorial times, this thing right over here is two factorial, times two factorial, which is going to be equal to, you could just write out the factorials, six times five times four times three times two times one, over four times three times two times one, times two times one, and of course, that's going to cancel with that, and then the one really doesn't change the value, so let me get rid of this one here, and then let's see, this three can cancel with this three, this four could cancel with this four, and then it's six divided by two is going to be three, and so we are just left with three times five, so we are left with, we are left with, there's 15 combinations, there's 360 permutations for putting six people into four chairs, but there's only 15 combinations, because we're no longer counting all of the different arrangements for the same four people in the four chairs, we're saying, hey, if it's the same four people, that is now one combination, and you could see, how many ways are there to arrange four people into four chairs? Well, that's the four factorial part right over here, the four factorial part right over here, which is four times three times two times one, which is 24, so we essentially just took the 360 divided by 24 to get 15, but once again, I don't want to, I don't think I can stress this enough, I want to make it clear where this is coming from. This right over here, let me circle, this piece right over here is the number of permutations, and this is really just so you can get to six times five times four times three, it's exactly what we did up here, where we reasoned through it, and then we just want to divide by the number of ways you can arrange four items in four spaces.
