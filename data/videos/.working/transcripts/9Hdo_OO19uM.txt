We are told Maria is older than her brother Manny. The table shows Manny's age and Maria's age, this table's right over here, how can we find Maria's age when Manny is 12 years old? So essentially when Manny is 12, how old is Maria? So pause this video, have a go at that before we do it together. Okay, so we see that when Manny's three years old, Maria is eight years old. Or another way to think about it is, Maria is five years older than Manny. You take Manny's age as an input, add five to it, you get Maria's age. Let's see if that holds up, and it should because if someone's five years older, people don't change. They're going to continue to be five years older as they age together. And we see that six plus five is 11, nine plus five is 14. So Maria's age, when Manny is 12, we're just going to add five to that. 12 plus five is 17 years old.
