We are told that f of x is equal to all of this, identify when f of x is greater than or equal to zero. So pause this video and have a go at that before we do this together. All right, so what we're going to be doing is thinking about all of the places where f of x could be equal to zero, and then also the places where f of x has a vertical asymptote, and those are all possible sign transition places, and some of them might even be included because this is not just greater than zero, this is greater than or equal to zero, and then we can test the intervals in between to see what's actually going on. So when does f of x equal zero? Well, that's if either of these expressions that we see up here, either of these expressions, are equal to zero. So that first one, if that's equal to zero, that means x equals three. This second one, if x plus two is equal to zero, that means that x is equal to negative two. So these are both interesting values. They're definitely places that we would include in the solution because the function is equal to zero at both of these points, but also let's think about where we might hit vertical asymptotes. So that's when the denominator is equal to zero. So for example, let's look at when two x plus one is equal to zero, two x plus one is equal to zero, that means two x is equal to negative one, that means x is equal to negative one half. And then last but not least, we could look at when x minus five is equal to zero, x minus five is equal to zero, or it's at x equals five. All right, so let's think about, I will just draw these out on a number line and we can maybe think about what we want to include or not include. So we go from negative two all the way up to five. So maybe if this is zero, let's see, we go one, two, three, four, five, and negative one, two, three, four, five. And so if we were thinking about, let's see, negative two right over here, so that is negative two, that's that first point or one of the first points, it's the lowest of the points. And then we go to x equals negative one half, which is right over here, negative one half. And actually, I'm gonna make sure that we don't include that point. So actually, I'm not even gonna fill it in, I'm gonna put an open circle there, that'll help us. So negative one half, but that is a place where we might see some type of a sign switch. We will include x equals negative two, because that's a place where the function is equal to zero. So it's nice that I filled that point in. And then next we go to x equals three, that's also another point where the function is equal zero, so I'll include that, one, two, three. So x equals three. And then last but not least, have x equals five, but we can't include it, because that's actually a restriction to the domain, it makes the denominator equal zero, so that's five. So let's think about when we're greater than zero. So let's try out negative three right over here. Let me do these in neutral colors actually. So let's try this point, negative three. So if I were to try that out, f of negative three is equal to negative three minus three times negative three plus two, all of that over, two times negative three, which is negative six plus one, times negative three minus five. And really all we care is the sign, whether we are greater than or less than zero. So this is going to be negative six times negative one, so our numerator is going to be positive in this situation. And then this is going to be negative five, and then this is going to be negative eight. So our numerator is going to be positive, negative times a negative, and our denominator is going to be positive. So this is going to be a positive value, and we're assuming we're not going to have any more signs, which is if we go to the left of negative two. So I'm going to include all of that when we are greater, saying that we are going to be greater than zero here. So I'm gonna include all of this in our solution set. And let's see what's happening in between here. So let's try at negative one. So F of negative one is equal to negative one minus three times negative one plus two, all of that over two times negative one, that's negative two plus one times negative two minus five. Our denominator, let's see, this is a negative, it's a negative one, this is a negative seven. Our denominator is still positive, but our numerator over here is now, this is going to be negative four, while this is going to be positive one. So our numerator is now negative, a negative or a positive, this is a negative. So we're gonna be less than zero here. So let's exclude this interval, this interval right over here, we're gonna exclude it. Now let's go to this section, and a number that's always fun to test out is zero. The math tends to be pretty straightforward. So let's see, F of zero is going to be negative three times two over one times negative five. And so that is equal to negative six over negative five, which is equal to positive six over five. So I'm feeling pretty good. I'm gonna shade that in in the green again. So this interval right over here, because I don't expect any sign changes. And we know that three is also included because that's where we equal zero. Now let me try out four, see what's going on there. I'm guessing that we might have a sign switch and this might not work, but let's try F of zero, F of, not F of zero, F of four, I should say. F of four is going to be four minus three, which is one, times four plus two, which is six, over two times four, which is eight plus one, which is nine. And then four minus five is negative one. So it's gonna be a positive over negative. So this is less than zero. Yep, this interval doesn't count. But now let's go to values larger than five and let's try six. So let's try, let me do this in a color I have not used. Well, I'll stay neutral. F of six is going to be six minus three, which is three, times six plus two, which is eight, over 12 plus one, which is 13, and six minus five, which is one. So everything here is positive. So this checks out. So I think we have our interval now. Our interval, we can go from, let me just write it, I'll write it in a neutral color. We can go from negative infinity and we're going to include up to and including negative two. And then to that, we are going to add, we're not going to include negative one half because our domain is restricted there. That's a vertical asymptote. All the way to and including three. And then to that, we're going to also add, if we're thinking about all of the intervals that work, we're gonna go from five to positive infinity. And we are done.
