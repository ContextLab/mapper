The goal of this video is to help you appreciate how debt gets paid down and how, if you increase your payment or the amount that you're paying each month, it gets paid down a lot faster. So the first thing you see in this title is amortization schedule, and that's a very fancy word for a very simple idea. The idea is when you are amortized something, you're just splitting it up, usually over some period of time. So when we're talking about an amortization schedule, we're usually talking about how are we splitting up the paying down of debt? And it's usually related to how much we are paying each month. So here's an example of two folks that each took out the same amount of debt, $12,000, but they're making a slightly different payment. Sophia is making $350 a month, while Lisa here is making $340 a month. What you're seeing here in these charts, you could view as an amortization schedule. Now, even though they're paying a fixed amount each month, how much of that goes to interest versus how much of that goes to principal changes. For example, in this first month of that $350 that Sophia is paying, $90 goes to interest, and $260 goes to principal. This $260 that goes to principal, this is literally taken from the balance. That $12,000 initial loan, that was not only the remaining balance or how much you're taking out, you could view that as the principle of the loan. So you have to pay some interest because they're charging you to borrow that loan, but some of that is paying down that loan. Notice $12,000 minus $260 is exactly 11,740. Now you might be wondering, why does this change every time? The next month when Lisa pays $350, why is the interest a little bit lower and the principal's a little bit higher? Well, think about it. In month two, the interest isn't being charged on 12,000 anymore, it's being charged on 11,740. So the faster that you pay down that principal, the faster that interest will come down, and then for every month that you pay a fixed amount, you're going to pay more and more towards principal. You can see that over here, where the amount being paid to principal for Sophia is higher than the amount being paid to principal, than Lisa, and it increases at a faster rate because she is paying down the loan faster. Now, another way that you could think about this is how long does it take you to pay down a loan? And to help us understand this, I have this time to pay off calendar calculator on Khan Academy, and let's say you borrowed $10,000 at a 22.99 interest rate, and you might say, hey, that's a ridiculously high interest rate. Well, it turns out that that could easily be your credit card interest rate. Now, if you pay $100 a month, which is sometimes more than the minimum payment, notice it says with this monthly payment, the loan will never be paid off. That is not a good situation to be paying 22.99% in perpetuity forever. In fact, the loan amount might increase because you aren't even paying off the interest here. So we could try out different amounts. If we were to pay $200 a month, it'll take us 167 months. Now, that still is not so pleasant. 167 months, that's what? Over 13, 14 years, you don't wanna take that long to pay down debt. Let's see if you paid 300 a month. Notice, it came down dramatically, only paying 50% more, I shouldn't say only, 50%'s a lot, but the time to pay off went down to under five years. If you were to do $400 a month, now you're under three years. If you were to go to $600 a month, now you're a little bit more than a year and a half. And then if you were to go to, let's call it a thousand a month, well, now you are under a year. So use these time to pay off calculators to see how quickly you can pay down your debt. And in general, especially when you have a very high interest rate like this, you should try to pay that down as much as possible. And don't just focus on the minimum payment.
