Jeff works as a waiter at a fancy restaurant. He receives a base amount of $70 each day, plus approximately $10 of tips for each client he serves, or $10 in tips for each client he serves. Assuming x represents the number of clients Jeff will serve in a day and y represents his daily salary. Draw the graph which represents Jeff's daily salary as a function of the number of clients he serves. So he's going to get $70 no matter what. So even when x, so even if he serves absolutely no clients, even if he serves absolutely no one, he's going to get $70. So when x is equal to 0, his pay for that day is still $70. Then he gets $10, they already told us, he gets $10 in tips for each client he serves. So if he goes from serving 0 clients to 1 client, he's going to get $10 in tips. If he goes from serving 1 client to 2 clients, he's going to get another $10 in tips. If he goes from serving 2 clients to 3 clients, he's going to get another $10 in tips. And you see that this line represents all the different possibilities for him. If he goes and serves 6 clients, he's going to get $60 in tips plus the $70. So the $70 he would have made otherwise plus $60 in tips gets him to $130. So this right here is the line. So we can check our answer. We got it right.
