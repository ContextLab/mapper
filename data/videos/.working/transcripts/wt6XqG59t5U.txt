Let's say that we have the equation six plus three w is equal to the square root of two w plus 12 plus two w. See if you could pause the video and solve for w. And it might have more than one solution, so keep that in mind. All right, now let's work through this together. So the first thing I'd like to do whenever I see one of these radical equations is just isolate the radical on one side of the equation. So let's subtract two w from both sides. I want to get rid of that two w from the right-hand side. I just want the radical sign. And if I subtract two w from both sides, what am I left with? Well, on the left-hand side, I am left with six plus three w minus two w. Well, three of something take away two of them. You're gonna be left with w. Six plus w is equal to, these cancel out. We're left with the square root of two w plus 12. Now to get rid of the radical, we're going to square both sides. And we've seen before that this process right over here, it's a little bit tricky, because when you're squaring a radical in a radical equation like this, and then you solve, you might be involving, you might find an extraneous solution. What do I mean by that? Well, we're gonna get the same result whether we square this or whether we square that, because when you square a negative, it becomes a positive. But those are fundamentally two different equations. We only want the solutions that satisfy the one that doesn't have the negative there. So that's why we're gonna test our solutions to make sure that they're valid for our original equation. So if we square both sides, on the left-hand side, we're going to have, well, it's gonna be w squared plus two times their product. So two times six times w, so that's 12w plus six squared, 36, is equal to, now if you take the square root, if you n squared, you're gonna be left with two w plus 12. Now we can subtract two w and 12 from both sides, so let's do that. So then we can get into kind of a standard quadratic form. So let's subtract two w from both sides. And let's subtract 12 from both sides. So subtract 12 from the right, subtract 12 here. And once again, I just wanna get rid of this on the right-hand side. And I am going to be left with, I am going to be left with, on the left-hand side, it's gonna be w squared, see 12w minus two w is plus 10w, and then 36 minus 12 is plus 24, is equal to zero. And let's see, to solve this, let's see, is this factor bar, there are two numbers that add up to 10, and whose product is 24. Well, what jumps out at me is six and four. So we can rewrite this as w plus four times w plus six is equal to zero. And so, if I have the product of two things equaling zero, well, to solve this, either one or both of them could be equal to zero. Zero times anything is going to be zero. So w plus four is equal to zero, or w plus six is equal to zero. And over here, if you subtract four from both sides, you get w is equal to negative four, or subtract six from both sides here, w is equal to negative six. Now let's verify that these actually are solutions to our original equation. Remember, our original equation was six, I'll rewrite it here. Our original equation was six plus three w is equal to the square root of two w plus 12 plus two w. So let's see, if w is equal to negative four, if w is equal to negative four, right over, let me do this in different, is equal to negative four, so that's gonna be six plus three times negative four is equal to the square root of two times negative four plus 12 plus two times negative four. So this would be, this is negative 12 here, this is negative eight here, this is negative eight here. So you have six plus negative 12, which is negative six is equal to the square root of negative eight plus 12 is four plus negative eight. So that would be negative six is equal to two plus negative eight, which is absolutely true. So this is definitely a solution. And let's try w is equal to negative six. So w is equal to negative six. So we're gonna get, if we look up here, we're gonna have six plus three times negative six is equal to the square root of two times negative six plus 12 plus two w. So this is going to be negative 18, this is going to be negative 12, negative 12 plus 12 is zero, square root of zero, this is all this zero. And then two times, and actually let me, I shouldn't have written a w there, I should have written a two times negative six. So back to what I was doing, this right over here is negative 18, this is two times negative six plus 12, this is all zero, square root of zero, zero, and then this is negative 12. So you get six plus negative 18, negative 12 is equal to zero plus negative 12, negative 12, which is absolutely correct. So these are actually both solutions to our original radical equation.
