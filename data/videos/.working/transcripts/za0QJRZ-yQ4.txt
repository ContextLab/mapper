Determine the domain and range of the function, f of x is equal to three x squared plus six x minus two. So the domain of the function is, what is the set of all of the valid inputs, or all of the valid x values for this function? And I can take any real number, square it, multiply it by three, then add six times that real number, and then subtract two from it. So essentially any number, if we're talking about reals, when we talk about any number. So the domain, the set of valid inputs, over which this function is defined, is all real numbers. So the domain here is all real numbers. And for those of you who might say, well, aren't all numbers real? You may or may not know that there is a class of numbers that are a little bit bizarre when you first learn them, called imaginary numbers and complex numbers. But I won't go into that right now, but most of the traditional numbers that you know of, they are part of the set of real numbers. It's pretty much everything but complex numbers. So you take any real number, and you put it here, you can square it, multiply it by three, then add six times it and subtract two. Now the range, at least the way we've been thinking about it in this series of videos, the range is the set of possible, the set of possible outputs of this function. Or if we set y equals f, y equal f of x on a graph, it's a set of all the possible y values. And to get a flavor for this, I'm going to try to graph this function right over here. And if you're familiar with quadratics, and that's what this function is right over here, it is a quadratic, you might already know that it has a parabolic shape. And so its shape might look something like this, and actually this one will look like this, it's upward opening, but other parabolas have shapes like that. And you see when a parabola has a shape like this, it won't take on any values below its vertex when it's upward opening, and it won't take any values, it won't take on any values above its vertex when it is downward opening. So let's look at, let's see if we can graph this, and maybe get a sense of its vertex. There are ways to calculate the vertex exactly, but let's see how we can think about this problem. So I'm gonna try some x and y values. There's other ways to directly compute the vertex. Negative b over two a is the formula for it, it comes straight out of the quadratic formula, which you get from completing the square. But let's try some x values, and then let's see what f of x is equal to. So let's try, well the values we've been trying in the last few videos. What happens when x is equal to negative two? Then f of x is three times negative two squared, which is four, plus six times negative two, which is six times negative two, so it's minus 12 minus two. So this is 12 minus 12 minus two, so it's equal to negative two. Now what happens when x is equal to negative one? So this is going to be three times negative one squared, which is just one, minus, or I should say plus six times negative one, which is minus six, and then minus two. And then minus two. So this is three minus six is negative three, minus two is equal to negative five, and that actually is the vertex, and you know the formula for the vertex, once again, is negative b over two a. So negative b, that's the coefficient on this term right over here, it's negative six over two times this one right over here. Two times three. Two times three, this is equal to negative one. So that is the vertex, but let's just keep on going right over here. So what happens when x is equal to zero? These first two terms are zero, you're just left with a negative two. When x is equal to positive one, and this is where you can see that this is the vertex. If you start seeing the symmetry, if you go one above the vertex, f of x is equal to negative two, if you go one x value below the vertex, or below the x value of the vertex, f of x is equal to negative two again. But let's just keep going. We could try, let's do one more point over here. So we have, we could try x is equal to one. When x is equal to one, you have three times one squared, which is one, so three times one, plus six times one, which is just six, minus two. So this is nine minus two, it's equal to seven. And that, I think, is enough points to give us a scaffold of what this graph will look like, what the graph of the function would look like. So it would look something like this. Let me do my best to draw it. So this is x equals negative two. Let me draw the whole axis. This is x is equal to negative one, this is x is equal to, this is x is equal to zero, and then this is x is equal to one right over there. And then when x is equal to, we go from negative two all the way to positive, or we should go from negative five all the way to positive seven. So let's say this is negative one, two, three, four, five. That's negative five over there on the y-axis. y-axis, and then let me go to positive seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I could keep going, this is in the y. And we're gonna set y equal to whatever our output of the function is. y is equal to f of x, and this is one right here. So let's plot the points. You have the point negative two, negative two. When x is negative two, this is the x-axis. When x is negative two, y is negative two. y is negative two, so that is that right over there. So that is the point, that is the point negative two comma negative two, fair enough. Then we have this point, we have this pink or purplish color. When x is negative one, f of x is negative five. When x is negative one, f of x is negative five. We already said that this is the vertex, and you'll see the symmetry around it in a second. So this is the point negative one, negative five. And then we have the point zero, negative two. Zero, negative two. When x is zero, y is negative two. Or f of x is negative two, or f of zero is negative two. So this is the point zero, negative two. And then finally, when x is equal to one, f of one is seven. f of one is seven. So that's right there, is the point one comma seven. And it gives us a scaffold for what this parabola, what this curve will look like. So I'll try my best to draw it, respectively. So it would look something, something like that. And keep on going in that direction, keep on going in that direction. But I think you see the symmetry around the vertex. That if you were to put a line right over here, the two sides are kind of the mirror images of each other. You can flip them over. And that's how we know it's the vertex. And that's how we also know, because this is an upward-opening parabola. I mean, there are formulas for vertex, and there are multiple ways of calculating it. But since it's an upward-opening parabola, the vertex is going to be the minimum point. This is the minimum value that the parabola will take on. So going back to the original question, this is all for trying to figure out the range, the set of outputs that this function can generate. You see that the function, it can get as low as negative 5. It got all the way down to negative 5 right at the vertex. But as you go to the right, as x values increase to the right or decrease to the left, then the parabola goes upwards. So the parabola can never give you values. f of x is never going to be less than negative 5. So our domain, but it can take on all the values. It can keep on increasing forever as x gets larger, as x gets smaller away from the vertex. So our range here, so we already said the domain is all real numbers. Our range, the possible y values, is all real numbers, all real numbers, greater than or equal to negative 5. It can take on the value of any real number greater than or equal to negative 5, nothing less than negative 5.
