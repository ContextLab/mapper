Hi everyone, Sal Khan here from Khan Academy. As you might notice, I am back in the walk-in closet where Khan Academy first started. I am socially distanced, like I'm sure many of you all are. And I just wanted to give you a quick message because I know in this time of crisis, there's a lot of anxieties about health, about the economy, and the fact that there are a billion students, and you might be one of them, who are not in school who otherwise would be. And all of us at Khan Academy, as a not-for-profit with a mission of providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere, we view it as our duty to step up for the world during this crisis. Over the last many years, we've been building resources, starting in pre-K with Khan Academy Kids that covers math, reading, writing, social-emotional learning. And then as you get into elementary school with math, and then we've recently launched English and Language Arts, then we go through middle school, and then in high school, math, we have things like SAT practice, that's reading, writing, and mathematics, and we have sciences, and we have the humanities, and we even go into early college courses. And we've realized that all of those can help bridge the gap as we go through this crisis together globally. But we wanna do more, that's why we have been doing things like webinars and live streams for parents and teachers around the world, we have our daily homeroom live stream that we're doing for folks, and we're just trying to figure out anything we can do to support you, the student, the teacher, the parent better. I do wanna remind everyone, we are a not-for-profit organization, and that means we are supported by philanthropic donations from folks like yourself. You own Khan Academy as much as I do, no one is the owner of Khan Academy, it is a public charity. And we were already running a deficit before this crisis hit, but now our load on our servers is 250% of what it typically would be, and it's continuing to accelerate. And so our costs are going up, our budget is the budget of a large high school, but we reach a reasonable chunk of humanity, and that chunk is getting even larger, and folks need us even more in this time of crisis. So if you find yourself to be in a position, you wanna make sure that other people have access to a free world-class education, that students, teachers, parents around the world are as supported as possible. Please think about making a donation.
