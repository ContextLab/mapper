What I would like you to do is pause this video and for each of these groups of numbers, we have this first group of three numbers in this yellow color and then we have this next group of numbers in this green color, I want you to order each of the groups from greatest to least. All right, now let's do this together and the way that I would do it is to go to the most significant place value, so I'd start on the left, and it's good to check whether we're starting truly in the same place value. It's not always the first number. For example, if instead of 13 million, this was just three million, the first number might be a three, which is larger than a one or a four, but this one is in the 10 million's place. So we have to make sure we're comparing the right, the same values. Now this isn't three million, this is 13 million, so let's start in the 10 million's place and we have one 10 million in every situation, so those are looking similar. Then we could go to the million's place, we have a three, a four, and a four. And remember, we're ordering from greatest to least, so we immediately see when we look at the millions that this has the least number of millions, this 13 million here. We don't even have to look at anything else. So we already know that the number here on the left is the smallest of the numbers. So if we're ordering from greatest to least, it's going to be over here, 13,467,200. We've used that one up. Now we're just going to compete between these two to see which one is larger and which one is smaller. We could go to the 100 thousands place. This has 800 thousands, this has 400 thousands. So this one over here is going to be the greatest. It is the largest of the numbers. So I could write it right over here. 14,862,301 is going to be greater than this number over there, 14,421,865, which is greater than the 13,467,200. All right, now let's do this next group of three numbers. Same idea, let's make sure that we're starting the same place value, millions, millions, millions, and they all have fours there. So no difference there. Then we go to the 100 thousands, five, five, five, no difference. Then we go to the 10 thousands, six, six, seven. So this one has the most 10 thousands. So this is the greatest. So let me rewrite this number down here. We're going greatest to least. So 4,574,210, I used this number up. And now let's keep going in the competition between the next two numbers. So now we go to the thousands place, still the same. And then we can go to the hundreds place, two hundreds, three hundreds. So this is the next largest number here. It has more hundreds than this one over here on the left. So we have our next number is going to be the same color, 4,562,310, which in turn is also greater than the smallest number, which is 4,562,290. And there we have it. This number is greater than this number, which is greater than that number. We have ordered from greatest to least.
