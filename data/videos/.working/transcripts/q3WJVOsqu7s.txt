I just wanted to give you a huge thank you for your support in 2016. It has helped Khan Academy reach over 100 million learners and has laid the foundation for 2017 where we will further develop all of our content in math, science, humanities, our adaptive software, our work around test prep, our ability to localize and internationalize so it can be used by learners all around the world. So once again, thank you for your trust, your support in myself and the team here at Khan Academy. We look forward to continuing to deliver on that trust for years to come.
