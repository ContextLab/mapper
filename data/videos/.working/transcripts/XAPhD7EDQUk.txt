What we're going to do in this video is get some practice subtracting multi-digit numbers. I'm gonna use 1,000 minus 528 as our example, but it's really to understand different methods and how they all fit together and why it actually makes sense. So if you wanted to visualize what this difference means, imagine something that has a length of 1,000, some type of units. So its length right over here is 1,000, and we were to take away 528 from that. So 528 from that is what we take away. And so this difference would be, well, what do we have left over? So this is equal to question mark. And I'm gonna do it two different ways. I'm gonna do it using a table with place value, and I'm also gonna do it using what's sometimes called the standard method, it's the way that people often learn to subtract numbers like this, especially if we're going to have to do some regrouping. So I'm actually gonna do them simultaneously for your benefit. All right, so let me just write out our table with our place values. So first of all, you have your thousands place, thousands, and let me square off the numbers here that are in the thousands place. So that's, I have 1,000 right over there, that's one in the thousands place. Then you have your hundreds place, hundreds place. In this number, I have zero hundreds right now. Here I have 500s. And then you have your tens place, tens, zero tens right there in the tens place, two tens right over there. And then of course you have your ones place, ones. Here I have zero ones, here I have eight ones. Now let me also rewrite these numbers, and I'm gonna do it using the standard method. So I have 1,000, and then I have zero hundreds. I have zero tens, and I have zero ones. And from that, I am going to subtract five hundreds, five hundreds, two tens, two tens, and eight ones. And eight ones. So let's do both of these at the same time. Let me make a little bit of a table right over here. So that is my table. So let's start with what we originally have. We have 1,000, that's what we're subtracting from. Well, on this table, I would just represent as that is 1,000. Now we wanna take five hundreds and two tens and eight ones from it. How do we do that? Because right now we have no hundreds, we have no tens, and we have no ones. And with the standard method, we have the same problem. Because we start in the ones place, and we say, hey, we wanna take eight ones from zero ones. Similar problem here, how do we take eight ones here? Similar, we wanna take two tens from zero tens. How do we do that here? And the answer is regrouping. What we wanna do is break up this thousand, and so that we can start to fill in these other categories. It's like exchanging money, that's sometimes an example used. So 1,000 is how many hundreds? Well, if we get rid of this thousands, I can break it up into 10 hundreds. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. And so that's equivalent of, I could get rid of this 1,000, or this one in the thousands place, and give myself 10 hundreds. Well, that starts to solve my problem, because I could now take five hundreds from this. I could take five from 10, five hundreds from 10 hundreds, but I still have the problem in the tens and the ones place. And so what I could do is, I could break up one of these hundreds into 10 tens. So let me do that. So I'm gonna take, let me do that in a color. So I'm gonna take that one away, and then that 100 is 10 tens. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. And if I did that here, well, if I take away one of the hundreds, I'm now going to have nine hundreds left, nine hundreds left, but now I have 10, now I have, now I have 10 tens. So I'm in good shape. Now I can take some tens here, but I still don't have any ones. Remember, I wanna take eight ones from here. So you can imagine what's going on. I could take one of my tens, and that's gonna give me one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 ones. And so over here, I could take away one of my tens. So I'm now going to have nine tens, and I'm gonna break that into 10 ones, 10 ones. And so now things are pretty straightforward. What do I do? Well, I can now take my eight ones from the 10 ones. So 10 minus eight, that is going to be two. How would I represent that over here? I'm gonna do the subtraction in this yellow color. Well, I wanna take away eight of these ones. So I take away one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and I am left with that two right over there. That two is that two. Now I can move on to the tens place. If I have nine tens and I take away two tens, I'm gonna be left with seven. I'm gonna be left with seven tens. How would we see it over here? Well, I have nine tens left over. I'm gonna take away two of them. So take a one, two, and I am left with seven. Is that seven? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, yep. That is seven tens right over there. We have two ones, seven tens, and so this seven is exactly this seven right over there. We do the same colors. I think you see where this is going, and the whole idea is not just to get the answer, but to understand how we got this answer. So in the hundredths place, if I have nine hundreds and I take away five hundreds, then I'm gonna be left with four hundreds. Same idea over here. I have nine hundreds. I take away one, two, three, four, five. I am going to be left with four hundreds. This four and this four is the same. And so there you get the general idea. With the standard method, it sometimes seems like magic of how we're regrouping things, but all we're doing is we're taking that thousand and saying, hey, that's 10 hundreds. And then we take one of those hundreds and we say, hey, that's 10 tens. And then we take one of those tens and we say, hey, that's 10 ones, and then we are able to subtract.
