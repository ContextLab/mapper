So let's talk a little bit about oblique asymptotes. So oblique tends to refer to something that's at a slant. So you can imagine these are asymptotes that are not vertical, nor are they horizontal. And just to imagine what this could look like, let's just imagine some type of a function here. I'll draw the axes. So that's my y-axis. This is my x-axis. And let's say you have an oblique asymptote. Let's say it looks something like, say it looks something like that. And it's for a function, which I will do in this blue color. So it might do all sorts of things for small x's, but as x gets larger, it will get closer and closer and closer to that asymptote. And similarly on that side, as x gets more and more negative, it might get closer and closer to that asymptote. So that's what we mean by an oblique asymptote. What we're gonna do in this video is think about how can we find the equation for that oblique asymptote if we're just given the function? So for example, if our function is, let me do it in this color right here. If our function is, I'll do it in white, f of x is equal to x to the third plus eight x minus four over x squared minus x plus three. When we look at just what's happening in this function, the numerator is going to be growing faster than the denominator when x gets very positive or very negative because the highest degree term in the numerator is a third degree term while in the denominator it's only x squared. But the question is, is how is that going to, what line will that potentially approach? And the way to understand that better is we'll do a little bit of algebraic long division to simplify this and we'll be able to, well, not simplify this, to write it differently in a way that we can think about what happens as x gets very positive or very negative. So let's do our algebraic long division. I'm gonna divide the denominator into the numerator. I'm really just rewriting the function. So let's see, we'll do, let me do it over here. So x squared minus x plus three, plus three algebraic long division goes into x to the third. And actually I'm gonna leave a little bit of space because I wanna second, I might need some space up here for my second degree term. So I'll put plus eight x minus four. And now let's do it. So look at the highest degree terms. x squared goes into x to the third x times, I'll write that in the x place. x times all of this business, x times x squared is x to the third. x times negative x is negative x squared. x times three is three x plus three x. And then we're going to want to subtract that. That goes away. You're left with negative of a negative as a positive. Positive x squared, eight x minus three x is five x. And then you have minus four. x squared goes into x squared one time, so plus one. One times all of that is x squared minus x plus three. Subtract. And then we get, that goes away, five x minus negative x is going to be six x. And then negative four minus three is negative seven. And so that's our remainder, because x squared won't go into that more times. And so we can rewrite f of x. We could say that f of x is equal to this, x plus one plus six x minus seven over x squared minus x plus three. Now, why is this interesting? Well, let's think about what happens when x gets very large or very negative. So, or very positive or very negative. As I could write as x approaches positive or negative infinity, our function, our function is approximately, as x becomes very positive or very negative, this denominator grows much faster than that numerator. So this thing, as you get very positive or very negative is going to go to zero, or it's, well, yes, it's going to go to zero. It's going to become a lot less consequential than what we see over here. So f of x is going to be approximately x plus one. So there you have it. We figured out our oblique asymptote in this case. The oblique asymptote is y is equal to x plus one. And we can actually see that on a graph. I graphed it ahead of time. And let me bring it in right there. And so in this situation, our function is in that teal color. That is our f of x. No, let me not, let me make, let me, our function is in that teal color. And you could see it does all this stuff when x is relatively small in magnitude, but as it gets larger and larger and larger or more and more negative, it is approaching y equals x plus one, which is that yellow line, that y equals x plus one right over here. That is that yellow line, which is the oblique asymptote.
