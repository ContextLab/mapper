We're told the distance in kilometers that three friends ran are represented below. Each large square represents one kilometer. All right, they visually tell us the distance in kilometers. Order the runners by distance from greatest to least. So pause this video and have a go at that. All right, now let's work through this together. So there's a couple of ways to do this. You could stay visual, or we could try to convert these into decimals and then compare them. Well, we could see that the large square, this is a full kilometer up here. Let me make sure my pen is working. This is a full kilometer right over here. So they all ran one full kilometer and then a little bit. So they're all one point something kilometers. So let's look at this next section. So it looks like this next full kilometer box, it's been divided into 10 equal rectangles. And Bobby has, we've colored in four of them. So this is four of the 10 equal rectangles. So this is four 10ths. So one way to think about it is Bobby ran one and four 10ths kilometers, or another way of thinking about it, this could be one and four 10ths. We have four in the 10ths place kilometers. Now let's go to Angel. Angel is one and how many, well, this is actually broken up into hundredths because each of those 10ths have now been broken up into 10. But we can see that this is a 10th there, this whole thing, that's one 10th. Then we have two 10ths, then we have three 10ths, four 10ths, or another way you could think about it, that's 40 hundredths right there. And then we have three more hundredths. So you could view that as four 10ths and three hundredths. So that is, let me do it the same way. We could view that as 43 over a hundred, 43 hundredths. That's how many we have colored in. Or kilometers, which is another way of saying one and four 10ths and three hundredths, which you could also say is one and 43 hundredths, kilometers, hundredths, kilometers. And last but not least, let's take a look at Charlie. So out of these hundredths there, so Charlie ran one and let's see how many hundredths, because this is all broken up into hundredths. So this is 10 hundredths, 20 hundredths, 30 hundredths, and then this looks like another nine, so 39 hundredths. One and 39 hundredths, kilometers, which you could also write this way, one and 39 hundredths, which is the same thing as three 10ths, because we could see one 10th, two 10ths, three 10ths, and then nine hundredths, which we have here for Charlie. So now let's just compare. If we go to the most significant, they all ran more than a kilometer, and that's this box over here if we compare them. So it's all going to boil down to what fraction of a kilometer they ran above that first kilometer. So if we go to the next significant place, Bobby ran four 10ths of a kilometer, Angel also ran four 10ths of a kilometer, but Charlie ran not quite four 10ths, ran three 10ths, and then some, so less than four 10ths of a kilometer. So if we want to order the runners from, by distance from greatest to least, so we want greatest on the left and least on the right, we know that Charlie is the least. So I'll write Charlie here on the left, or sorry, on the right, I'd have to get my left from right. So this is Charlie, is going to be the least, right over there. And now let's compare Bobby and Angel. They had the same number of whole, of ones, same number of 10ths, but then when we go to the hundredths place, we have three hundredths for Angel and we have no hundredths for Bobby. We could put a zero here if we just want to compare directly. So Angel ran further than Bobby. So if we want greatest to least, we'd want Angel first, then Bobby, then Bobby, and then Charlie. Greatest is Angel, least is Charlie, and we're done.
