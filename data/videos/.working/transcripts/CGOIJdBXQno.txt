Those investors who sold stocks just before the stock market crashed in 1929 were either wise or exceptional lucky. And maybe we have no error. So even when I read that, what felt really awkward was saying wise or exceptional lucky. This exceptional felt really strange because it's trying to modify the lucky. It's trying to tell us what type of lucky we were. We were not exceptional lucky. This is an adverb. An adverb, we should say we were exceptionally lucky. So the error right over here is in D. We don't need just an adjective. We need an adverb. We are modifying another adjective. We're modifying lucky. What type of lucky we were? We were exceptionally lucky. So the error is in part D.
