Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy, and I just wanted to let you know how excited all of us are for what we have in store this coming back to school. First and foremost, this is going to be a big effort in terms of working with teachers and classrooms. This coming back to school, teachers are going to be able to better assign practice on Khan Academy and get reports on where their students are to give optimal personalized practice. This practice is going to be aligned with standards across subjects and grades. We're also adding a lot more content. And to be clear, Khan Academy is much, much, much more than just videos. We have standards aligned practice across subjects and grades. Keep a lookout for well beyond math, biology, chemistry, physics, and especially this coming year, we're adding a lot in history. We're creating many tools for independent learners and folks who are trying to prepare for college and important standardized exams like the SAT. We're really trying to reach the world. Our mission is a free world class education for anyone, anywhere. So we're going to continue our efforts in Spanish, in Portuguese, in Hindi, and launch in other significant geographies. So there's a lot of work ahead of us, but we're very, very, very excited. And I just want to thank all of y'all for being part of the Khan Academy community. And many of you have directly supported these efforts. And I hope you too feel proud of all of the reach and impact that we are able to collectively have.
