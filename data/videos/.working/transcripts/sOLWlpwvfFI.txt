We're told consider the exponential function F, which they've after I had over here. What is the domain and what is the range of F? So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, now let's work through this together. So let's first of all just remind ourselves what domain and range mean. Domain is all of the X values that we could input into our function where our function is defined. So if we look over here, it looks like we can take any real number X that is any positive value, it looks like it's defined. This graph keeps going on and on to the right and this graph keeps going on and on to the left. We could also take on negative values. We could even say X equals zero. I don't see any gaps here where our function is not defined. So our domain looks like all real numbers or another way to think about it is X can take on any real number and if you put it into our function, F of X is going to be defined. So now let's think about the range. The range as a reminder is the set of all of the values that our function can take on. So when we look at this over here, it looks like if our X values get more and more negative, the value of our function just goes up towards infinity. So it can take on these arbitrarily large values but then as we move in the positive X direction, our function value gets lower and lower and lower and it looks like it approaches zero but never quite gets to zero. And actually that's what this dotted line over here represents. That's an asymptote. That means that as X gets larger and larger and larger, the value of our function is going to get closer to this dotted line which is at Y equals zero but it never quite gets there. So it looks like this function can take on any real value that is greater than zero but not at zero or below zero. So all real numbers greater than, greater than zero or another way to think about it is we could set the range saying F of X is greater than zero, not greater than or equal to. It'll get closer and closer but not quite equal that. Let's do another example where they haven't drawn the graph for us. So let's look at this one over here. So consider the exponential function H and actually let me get rid of all of this so that we can focus on this actual problem. So consider the exponential function H where H of X is equal to that. What is the domain and what is the range of H? So let's start with the domain. What are all of the X values where H of X is defined? Well, I could put any X value here. I could put any negative value. I could say what happens when X equals zero. I can say any positive value. So once again, our domain is all real numbers for X. Now, what about our range? This one is interesting. What happens when X gets really, really, really large? Let's pick a large X. Let's say we're thinking about H of 30, which isn't even that large, but let's think about what happens. That's negative seven times 2 thirds to the 30th power. What does 2 thirds to the 30th power look like? That's the same thing as equal to negative seven times two to the 30th over three to the 30th. You might not realize it, but three to the 30th is much larger than two to the 30th. This number right over here is awfully close to zero. In fact, if you wanna verify that, let me take a calculator out, and I can show you that. If I took two divided by three, which we know is 0.6 repeating, and if I were to take that to the 30th power, it equals a very, very, very small positive number. But then we're going to multiply that times negative seven, and if we want, let's do that, times negative seven. It equals a very, very small negative number. Now, if you go the other way, if you think about negative exponents, so let's say we have H of negative 30, that's going to be negative seven times 2 thirds to the negative 30, which is the same thing as negative seven. This negative, instead of writing it that way, we could take the reciprocal here, this is the same thing as 3 halves, to the positive 30 power. Now, this is a very large positive number, which we will then multiply by negative seven to get a very large negative number, just to show you that that is a very large positive number. So if I take 3 halves, which is 1.5, of course, 3 halves, and I am going to raise that to the 30th power, that is a, well, it's a hundred and ninety, roughly 192,000, but now, if I multiply by negative seven, it's going to become a large negative number, times negative seven. It's equal to a little bit over negative million. So one way to visualize this graph, and I'll do it very quickly, is what's happening here. And if we want, we can think about, this is the x-axis, this is the y-axis, we can even think about when x equals zero, this is all one, and so H of zero is equal to negative seven. So if we say negative seven right over here. When x is very negative, H takes on very large negative values, we just saw that. And then as x becomes more and more positive, it approaches zero, the function approaches zero, but never quite exactly gets there. And so once again, we could draw that dotted, let me do that in a different color so you can see it, we can draw that dotted asymptote line right over there. So what's the range? So we could say all real numbers less than zero. So let me write that. It is all real numbers less than zero. Or we could say that f of x can take on any value less than zero, f of x is going to be less than zero. It approaches zero as x gets larger and larger, but never quite gets there.
