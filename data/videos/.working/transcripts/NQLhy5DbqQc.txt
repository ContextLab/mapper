We are told a rectangle has a perimeter of 32 centimeters. Which of the following could be the length and width of the rectangle? And they tell us to pick two answers. So pause this video, have a go at it before we do it together. All right, well, one way to do it is just to look at each of these choices and think about what that perimeter would be. So let's say this one right over here, I'm gonna draw it small so we have space to do it. So let's say its height is 11 and its width is five. And so if that's the case, then this other side, this other height on the other side of it, I guess you could say, is also 11 and this top side is also five. So what the perimeter going to be? This is going to be 11 plus five, plus 11 plus five, which is equal to, let's see, 11 plus five is 16, 11 plus five is 16, 16 plus 16 is 32 centimeters. So this one does have a perimeter of 32. So it could be the length and width of the rectangle. So I like this one right here. Now let's look at this choice. Okay, and this one I can already, I have my spidey sense tells me that it's not going to add up because eight is smaller than 11 and four is smaller than five. So I don't think we're gonna get quite to 32 centimeters. So, but let's just double check. So let me draw another rectangle here. So this height is eight, four, we have another eight, we have four, let's add them all together. We have eight plus four plus eight plus four, which is going to be 12 plus 12. And my intuition was right, 12 plus 12 is only 24 centimeters. So we'll rule this one out. So this one is probably going to be the other choice because it says pick two answers, but let's verify that. So we get a rectangle here. So this is nine centimeters, this is seven centimeters, this would be nine as well. And then this would be seven. So if we find the perimeter, it'd be nine plus seven plus nine plus seven, nine plus seven plus nine plus seven. Nine plus seven is equal to 16, nine plus seven is 16, 16 plus 16 is 32 centimeters. So yes, this one is also a correct answer.
