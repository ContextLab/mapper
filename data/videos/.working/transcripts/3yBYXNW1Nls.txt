The first thing I want to do in this video is given the information given about this triangle, figuring out the unknowns, figuring out the length here, this value a, figuring out this length in orange, b, figuring out the measure of this angle, which we'll call alpha, and figuring out in radians, and figuring out the measure of this angle right over here in blue that we could call beta. So I encourage you to pause the video now, and given the information that we have, try to figure out these unknowns. So I'm assuming you've given it a try. So let's see what we can determine. So we know two of the side lengths, and they're the same. They both have side length 2. And they've given us one of the angles right over here. This yellow angle has a measure of pi over 3 radians. So one thing that jumps out at me is that this is an isosceles triangle. An isosceles triangle has two sides that have the same length. So this side is congruent to that side right over there. And so that means that the base angles, the corresponding base angles, are also going to be congruent. And that's just because this is a property of isosceles triangles. So these two are congruent, so the two base angles are going to be congruent. So that means that beta is also equal to pi over 3 radians. So beta is also equal to pi over 3 radians. Now what else can we attempt to figure out? Well, if we know beta is pi over 3, and we know this angle in yellow is pi over 3 radians, we can figure out what this angle over here in white is. And I don't know. Let's call that angle. The measure of that angle, let's call it x. If we're thinking in terms of radians, x plus this angle plus pi over 3 radians plus pi over 3 radians. This is the sum of the interior pi over 3. This is the sum of the interior angles of this larger triangle right over here. They're going to sum up to pi radians. If we're thinking in degrees, it would be 180 degrees. So those are going to sum up to pi radians. So what's x going to be? In this one, you can almost look straight at it. And you say, oh, this is going to be pi over 3. But if you want to solve it a little bit more systematically, you can subtract these two from both sides. And you get x is equal to, I'll rewrite this orange pi as 3 pi over 3 pi over 3. This is the same thing as pi. Minus pi over 3. Minus pi over 3. Minus pi over 3. Minus pi over 3. Which, of course, 3 pi minus pi minus pi is going to be pi over 3. Pi over 3. So this angle's measure is also pi over 3 radians. Now that's interesting, because this shows us that this is actually an equilateral triangle. All of the sides, when all of the angles have the same angle measure, that means all the sides are going to be congruent. So if this side is 2, this side is 2, then that means that this entire side right over here, is equal to 2. Now what else can we attempt to figure out? Well, let's see. We know this is pi over 3 radians. We know beta's pi over 3. We know that this is, if we think in degrees, 90 degrees, which is the same thing as pi over 2. So if we know these two angles of a triangle, we can figure out what alpha is. We know that alpha, let me write it here. Alpha plus pi over 3 plus pi over 3 plus this right angle, which in radians is pi over 2, plus pi over 2. That's this angle right over here. Plus pi over 2 are going to equal the sum of interior angles of a triangle. Remember, we're looking at this triangle right over here. That's going to be equal to, if we thought in degrees it would be 180 degrees in radians, it would be equal to pi. So we get alpha. Alpha is equal to pi, which is the same thing. Let's see, I'll find a common denominator of 6. Let's see, we can write that as 6 pi over 6 minus pi over 3, which is the same thing as 2 pi over 6. I'm just subtracting this from both sides, and I wrote it like that. Minus pi over 2, which is the same thing as 3 pi over 6. That's going to be equal to 6 minus 2 minus 3 is 1. That's going to be equal to pi over 6. Alpha is pi over 6. Let me write that. Alpha is equal to pi over 6 radians. This over here is pi over 6 radians. What's interesting about that is that shows that alpha is exactly half of this pi over 3 radian white angle right over here. So if that has measure angle at alpha, then this one also has alpha, a measure of alpha radians. Pi over 6 plus pi over 6 is pi over 3. Now what's interesting about that is that gives us confidence that this thing over here is going to be bisecting this side over here, that this length is equivalent to this length right over here. We are bisecting this angle. And so when we get to the other side, and this is an isosceles triangle, we could actually now prove that these are congruent triangles, that you have a side, an angle, and a side, side, angle, side. And so this side corresponds to that side. So these two sides need to be congruent. Now because these two sides are congruent, we know if this has length b, then this also has length b. So we know that b plus b is equal to 2. And now we could use that information to solve for a, using the Pythagorean theorem. This is a right triangle, so we could say a squared plus b squared, which is 1 squared, is equal to 2 squared. Or we could say, let's see, a squared is going to be equal to 2 squared minus 1. So it's going to be equal to 3. I just subtracted 1 from both sides. And so we would have a is equal to the square root of 3. And if you remember your special right triangles from geometry class, your 30, 60, 90 triangles, you'll recognize that this is one of them. But instead of calling it a 30, 60, 90 triangle, we could call it a pi over 6, pi over 3, pi over 2 radian triangle. But it really is in degrees 30, 60, 90. And we see it has the properties of the 30, 60, 90 triangle, where the shortest side is, or the side opposite, the pi over 6 radian angle has half the length of the hypotenuse. And then the longer non-hypotenuse side is square root of 3 times the shorter side. The side opposite the 60 degree angle, or the pi over 3 radian angle, has a length of square root of 3 times the shortest side. So just like that, we were able to figure out all of the missing information in this. Now given that, what I want to do is figure out what the sine, cosine, and tangent of alpha actually are. And I could have done it for alpha, or I could have done it for beta. But I'll just do it for alpha. And actually, I'll leave it as an exercise to you to do it for beta. So let's figure out the sine of alpha. And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think of what this is. Well, the sine of alpha is the same as sine of pi over 6. And remember, Soka-Toa definition. So-co-toa. Let me do toa in a different color. So-co-toa. Sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So for this angle right over here, the opposite side is 1. So this is equal to 1 over the hypotenuse. 1 over 2. So sine of pi over 6 is 1 half. Now what is cosine of alpha? Or what is cosine of pi over 6? Cosine of pi over 6? Well, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. So the adjacent side to this angle, that's not the hypotenuse, is square root of 3. And the hypotenuse, once again, is 2. So the cosine of pi over 6 is square root of 3 over 2. And then finally, for the tangent of pi over 6, we could just take the sine over the cosine, or we could say it's the opposite over the adjacent. The opposite is 1. The opposite angle to alpha is 1. And the adjacent is square root of 3. So it's 1 over the square root of 3. And if you don't like irrational numbers in the denominator, we can multiply it by the square root of 3 over the square root of 3 to get square root of 3 over 3. And we are done. We have figured out a lot about this triangle.
