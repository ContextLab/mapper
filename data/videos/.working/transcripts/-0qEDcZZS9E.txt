We can never have too much practice getting familiar with vectors. And what I want to do in this video is in particular be able to relate the x and y components of a vector to the initial and terminal points to where we place it in the coordinate planes. What am I talking about? So let's say we have some vector where its initial point is here. So that's at point A. And its terminal point is, I will do that in brown. Its terminal point, let's say, is right over here. Let's call that point B. And so the vector is going to look like this. And I will do that, I want to do that in a color, well I'll do it in green. So let me see if I can draw, all right. So that's what the vector is going to look like. That green isn't super visible, but I can color it in a little bit better. Let me color it in so you can really see it now. All right, so that's what my vector looks like. It starts based on where I've placed it on the coordinate plane. It has an initial point at A and a terminal point at B. And what I want to do is, if I know the coordinates of A and B, figure out what the X and Y components of my vector, let's just call this vector, let's call this vector V. Let's call that vector V. So what are the coordinates of A? So the coordinates of A, the X coordinate is negative one, negative two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So A is equal to negative eight, comma, and the Y coordinate is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So it's negative eight, comma, seven. This is negative eight, this is seven. And the point B, the terminal point of the vector, that has the coordinates, let's see, X equals one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, comma, and then the Y coordinate is negative one, negative two, seven, comma, negative two. So given that, what are going to be the X and Y components of our vector V? Well, let's just think about it. So our vector V, and there's multiple ways that we've already seen that we can express a vector. One way is use the unit vector notation, where, actually let me do it that way first, where this is, whatever's in parentheses, is our X component, and then whatever is in these parentheses is our Y component. I'm just multiplying, I really am just scaling up the unit vector in the horizontal direction and the unit vector in the vertical direction. And you could look at the videos on unit vector notation if this looks foreign to us. But let's figure out what the X component is going to be. Well, one way to think about it is you could just view it as the change in X between the initial point and the terminal point. So the change in X is going to be the terminal X seven minus the initial X, minus negative eight. And our Y component, we could just view as the change in Y from the initial point to the terminal point. So we finish at the terminal point, so that is negative two, negative two, minus, minus our initial Y, minus seven, minus seven. And so what does this give us? Well, let me do all of this. So seven minus negative eight, that's the same thing as seven plus eight, or seven plus plus eight. So that's going to be equal to 15. So we get 15 times I, 15, I'll do this part in blue, 15 I plus, and I'll do this in this mauve color, negative two minus seven, that is negative nine. So I could say plus negative nine J, or I could just say minus nine, minus nine J. That's one way to write our vector. That's one way to write our vector. And our other way is just to make sure we remember there's just a bunch of different notations that people use for vectors. You could write it like this. You could actually just use parentheses. You could just say it's 15 comma nine, 15 comma, sorry, not 15 comma nine, 15 comma negative nine, 15 comma negative nine. These are just different representations of the same vector. You could even write it like this. Vector V is equal to, you could write it as a column vector. You could write it as 15, 15, negative nine. So depending on what book or notation and what class you're in, you might see all of these things. These are all the same vectors that you know and love. We can see that over here. We can see that over here. 15i, 15i is going to be a vector that's 15 times bigger than the unit vectors in the horizontal direction. So one, whoops, so let me draw that. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. So this right over here is the vector 15i. So let me draw that. So that right over there, that is the vector 15i. And then the vector negative nine j, well, it's gonna go down nine. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So negative nine j is gonna look like this. Negative nine j, negative nine j. That's a little bit hard to read. Let me trace that in black. Negative, negative nine j. And you see, if you take 15i plus negative nine j, you're going to get our entire vector v, which is exactly what we wrote here. You could say the x component is 15, the y component is negative nine. Or another way to say it, if we go from point a to b, you're change in x, you increased 15, you're change in y, well, you decreased nine. And that tells you the x and y components of the vector that starts here and then moves there. Now this just happens to be where we place this vector, as we know, as we do different things with vectors, we might choose to shift them around. But the important thing is that they keep the same magnitude and direction.
