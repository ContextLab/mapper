So what I have here are two angles, angle Y. I wanna figure out the measure, I wanna figure out the measure of angle Y here on the left. And then on the right here, I wanna figure out the measure, measure of angle X. So why don't you pause this video and have a go at it before we do it together. So here, Y is a big angle. It's gonna have a big angle measure and Y is made up of these three smaller angles. Each of them have a measure of 40 degrees. So this is going to be, maybe I'll do that same purple. It's going to be 40 degrees plus 40 degrees plus 40 degrees. So four plus four plus four is 12. So 40 plus 40 plus 40 is 120, 120 degrees. Now here, we have each of these Xs, this measure of X plus it again, plus it again, plus it again is going to be equal to 80 degrees or another way to think about it is, we could start with 80 degrees and divide it by four. So 80 divided by four is going to be 20, 20 degrees. And you can see that 20 plus 20 plus 20 plus 20 is indeed 80 degrees.
