So the work energy principle states that the network done on an object is going to equal the change in kinetic energy of that object and this works for systems as well. So the network done on a system of objects is going to equal the change in the total kinetic energy of the objects in that system. Now that sounds really complicated and technical but I like to think about the work energy principle as a shortcut. This is a really nice shortcut that lets me determine the change in kinetic energy without having to do a bunch of complicated conservation of energy equations or kinematic formulas. The catch is that I need to know how to figure out what the net work is. So how do you figure out net work? Well the formula for work done is F d cosine theta. Since this formula work energy principle relies on net work this has to be magnitude of the net force times magnitude of the distance traveled times cosine of theta. Remember this theta has to be angle between not any angle, angle between the net force direction and the direction of motion. And so let's let's try this out. How do you use this thing? Let's kick the tires. Let's say there's a satellite it's moving to the right and there's a net force on this satellite. Now this net force could go in any direction. If the net force has a component in the direction of motion then the network's going to be positive and if so anything here from like negative 90 well like I said like negative 89.9 because 90 would be perpendicular for many for like 89.9 negative to positive 89.9 you've got a component in the direction of motion that means you're going to be doing positive network and that means the change in kinetic energy will be positive because it just equals that number that means kinetic energy increases you're going to be speeding up and that kind of it makes sense intuitively. If your force is in the direction of motion you're speeding up. What about the other case? What if your net force points in the opposite direction of motion? Well now the network's going to be negative you'll have a negative change in kinetic energy. In other words you're going to slow down and if the net force points perpendicular well then you're not doing any work because cosine of 90 is going to be zero. No network would be done. There's going to be no change in kinetic energy. That doesn't mean you stop it just means you're not going to speed up or slow down. This does something you might be like doesn't it do something yeah you're going to drift upward you're going to start changing your direction but this is not going to be doing any work on you at that moment. And so just to be clear I mean let's just try a complicated one here let's say this force goes in some direction let's say your velocity even goes down so maybe maybe your satellite's heading downward and your force is going to go in any direction. Well if it goes this way exactly backwards it's going to be 180 you're going to be doing negative work you're going to be slowing down decreasing kinetic energy and you're not going to change direction. If you're like this you have a component opposite so you're going to be slowing down and changing direction. This will just be changing direction you're not speeding up or slowing down at that moment. This will speed you up and change your direction and finally this will just be speeding you up and you will not be changing your direction. So the work energy principle is convenient to just get a conceptual or qualitative idea of what's going on and it can obviously also give you an idea of how to calculate things. Let's try one where you actually have to get a number so let's say there's a hot air balloon and it's a 300 kilogram hot air balloon drifting to the left it had an initial speed of seven meters per second and it's traveling a total of 50 meters to the left during this journey. Now there's going to be forces on this hot air balloon obviously there's going to be gravity and some buoyant force but because these are perpendicular to the direction of motion they do no work and so when we're going to use this work energy principle they're not even going to factor in. We don't even have to know these since they were perpendicular and did no work you only consider the forces in the direction of motion. So let's say there was a wind gust helping you to the left here of 200 newtons but this is a big bulky balloon not that aerodynamic and so there was a drag force from air resistance of 104 newtons to the right. What we want to know is we want to determine the final speed of the hot air balloon after it travels 50 meters directly to the left with the forces shown. Now there's lots of different ways to do this you know Newton's laws you can do kinematic formulas all kinds of stuff even momentum technically impulse but the easiest I'm pretty sure the easiest way to do this is just going to be the work energy principle which states that the net work done is going to equal the change in kinetic energy so let's go ahead and do it. So we know that net work is equal to the magnitude of the net force times the magnitude of the distance traveled times cosine of the angle between them. What's change in kinetic energy mean? Well change in anything is final minus initial so since kinetic energy is one half mv squared this is just going to be one half mv final squared minus one half mv initial squared so this is going to be the changing kinetic energy final minus initial. All right let's plug in numbers here so net force how do we get that vertical pieces don't matter we're just looking horizontally here those are the only ones that are going to affect it these vertical ones just cancel so we have 200 to the left 104 to the right so we're going to have to subtract those to get 96 to the left and we just want magnitude so I'm going to get 96 newtons to the left not negative or anything I'm just taking magnitude times the distance traveled we know that's 50 so we get times 50 meters cosine of the angle now this is careful you might be like oh 180 here but no the net force points to the left this 200 is winning here so leftward net force and the leftward direction the angle between those two is zero cosine of zero is just one we're maxed out here so net force points in the direction of motion so equals let's plug in the rest of this one half the mass is 300 kilograms times v final squared that's what we want to determine minus one half 300 kilograms times the initial speed is seven meters per second so we got seven meters per second squared well 96 times 50 is going to come out to 4800 that means that's the network done notice that's joules that's how much energy we've added that's the change in kinetic energy so we know the network is changing kinetic energy we've added 4800 joules of kinetic energy that's going to have to equal half of 300 is 150 kilograms times v final squared minus if you take a half of 300 times seven squared you're going to get 7350 so this is how much energy the hot air balloon started with initially so i have to move that to the left we add those together i'm going to get 12 150 joules is how much kinetic energy the balloon ends with and that's got to equal 150 kilograms times v final squared i could divide 12 150 by 150 and you get exactly 81 and that's going to equal the final squared and if you take a square root of that you get exactly so the final velocity of this hot air balloon is nine meters per second it sped up that's not surprising this net force was directed leftward and the object was moving leftward so we're doing positive work we're increasing the kinetic energy we started with seven meters per second we ended with nine meters per second and this is an example of how you use the work energy principle so to recap the work energy principle states the network is equal to the change in kinetic energy this can help you just conceptually or qualitatively determine whether something's going to speed up slow down or change direction or both and then quantitatively you can use this to specifically solve for the change in kinetic energy as well as the final or initial speed something might have had
