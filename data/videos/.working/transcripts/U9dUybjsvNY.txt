I'm here with Dr. Umamah Marvi. Hello. And what are we going to talk about? We're talking about arthritis today. Arthritis, something that I've heard a lot about, but what exactly does it mean? So arthritis, I think in Greek, arth is arth, arth road, joint, and itis is inflammation. I see. So if you literally interpret it, it means joint inflammation. So just having joint pain doesn't necessarily mean you have arthritis. You have to have some underlying, some inflammation. I see. And is it just one disease? Oh, no. There are about a hundred different types of arthritis, and since it depends on what is causing that inflammation, we can categorize them in many, many, many different ways. So the most common arthritis that most people know about and think about is osteoarthritis. It's more of a, we call it degenerative arthritis. And the other next common, most common, is rheumatoid arthritis. I see. And then there's about, you know, like a hundred other types of arthritis, and I'll just briefly mention, you know, so arthritis or inflammation could be due to an infection. So that's septic arthritis. It could be due to crystals or a gout. People have heard of that, and multiple other things. I see. Yeah. So just so you're aware of that. I see. We're going to focus on the most common ones, which is osteoarthritis, which is about, osteoarthritis is about 10% of the population, but when you really look at it, about 30% of women after the age of 60 will have osteoarthritis. Wow. And about 20% of men, in one joint at least. I see. As opposed to rheumatoid arthritis, which is considered more of an inflammatory type of arthritis, because it has a lot more inflammation, swelling, warmth. So when we talk about inflammation, those are the symptoms that are going to be, in addition to having pain, you're going to have swelling, you're going to have warmth, you're going to have stiffness. You may or may not have redness, depending on how severe the inflammation is. Okay. So at a high level, what are the different symptoms between the two? Yeah. So not only are different joints affected, in osteoarthritis versus rheumatoid arthritis, most people who have osteoarthritis will complain of pain, usually in the evenings. They'll have pain after they've done pretty strenuous, you know, some activity, or if they've overused that joint, they're going to have more pain. They complain of stiffness mostly, but stiffness is lasting only for about five minutes in the morning. So when they wake up, they loosen up, but then, you know, 30 minutes maximum is, you know, five to 30 minutes is when you feel that stiffness and it starts getting better as you start moving around. As opposed to in rheumatoid arthritis, where most of the pain and stiffness is happening early in the morning when they wake up, oh my God, they feel, you know, it takes them an hour to two hours to start moving around and feeling loose again. So just to be clear, so you're saying osteoarthritis, usually the pains in the evening, they might have at most five to 30 minutes of just kind of a little bit of stiffness. Stiffness in the morning, yeah. But rheumatoid arthritis, that's where their pain is in the morning. Yeah, mornings is worse. Of course, you know, both of these diseases, you can have pain all throughout the day, but generally it's worse in the morning for rheumatoid arthritis patients and it improves as the day goes on. It also improves with activity. So the more active a rheumatoid patient is, the less their symptoms are bothering them. If they're sitting for too long, they're going to feel like things just are hurting more and more stiff. Osteoarthritis improves with activity as well. Osteoarthritis is opposite. So the more active they are, the more it hurts because it's overuse related. The more you use the joint, the more the pain will be. So that's just kind of basic, you know, ways you can classify some of the symptoms and that's how we try to tease what could be the cause of the symptoms. The other thing, the way that osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are different is that in osteoarthritis, mostly the joints affected are the weight-bearing joints. So your spine, so it could be neck, it could be lumbar spine, lower back spine, hips and knees. Spine. Hips, knees, and then your hands. So certain, some joints of the hand are affected. In rheumatoid arthritis, since it's not necessarily weight-bearing, you can have arthritis, mostly hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, feet, knees as well and hips as well. But, you know, in osteoarthritis, very large weight-bearing joints and that's important to know. I see. Hands and bows, but... But hands also, in osteoarthritis, there are certain joints of the hand that are affected. In rheumatoid, there's other joints of the hand that are affected. So that also depends from... Differentiates the two. Other things we want to talk about, I didn't mention the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. So it's about 1% of the population is much more common in women than men. It's usually in women in their 40s and 60s will develop rheumatoid arthritis, but again, people fall outside of that as well. Osteoarthritis is a disease of older age. So the older you get, the more likely you will get it, but not all old people will have osteoarthritis, so there is a genetic predisposition for it as well. There's also, if you are obese, you have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis because your weight-bearing joints are affected. And if you've had some injury to the joint, so in the past if you had, you know, you played soccer and you pulled a ligament in your knee, then in the future instability of the joint can cause more likely to have osteoarthritis in the future. And other things are overused, so people who do some repetitive activities for a long, long time could potentially cause some injury to that joint that's micro injuries and that can later develop into osteoarthritis. And what about rheumatoid? Rheumatoid arthritis, again... So it's women? Women are genetic, so definitely family history. Okay, so genetic is common to both? Common to both. And beyond that, I mean, we don't really know the cause and we don't really... There's no other real way to predict multidem inappropriately and it's causing inflammation of your own joints. Alright, so it's attacking itself. And it's not an infection or anything like that. We don't think so far, so because your immune system is acting inappropriately, there are some blood markers in your blood if you have rheumatoid arthritis, such as rheumatoid factor, people talk about. And other tests that can indicate that you have a high risk for having it or you may have it. I see. So let's talk a little bit about what is actually going on in osteoarthritis versus rheumatoid arthritis, and you can look at this photo here and I can show you what different things here are. So this is an example of a joint, and you see there are two bones coming together to make that joint. One bone, two bones, yeah. And the lining right around that bone in the gray or brown color is the thick, thick, is the cartilage, this entire thing. This gray area. Gray area. So cartilage is basically a spongy material that serves as a shock absorber for your joint. And lining the cartilage in blue, you see that there is some fluid. And so the fluid is also going to help with the shock absorbing and helping have a nice gliding motion when you are moving that joint. The fluid is lined by a synovial lining or membrane. Synovial fluid lined by synovial lining. Synovial lining or synovial membrane where there are cells and these cells are immune cells and for some reason in rheumatoid arthritis those cells replicate and can cause a local inflammation. I see. So the membrane just gets thicker. Thicker and because there is so much other, they are recruiting other cells and more blood flow, that causes destruction of the surrounding structures. So you can get destruction of the bones right there and they can make holes in the bones, we call them erosions. They can also cause destruction of the surrounding ligaments, of the cartilage and that causes you to get pain, causes deformities of the joint and causes, instability of the joint so the joint can't function. That's in rheumatoid arthritis. In osteoarthritis, we don't think that the synovial membrane is that active. Again, there is some level of inflammation going on there but most of it is related to the cartilage lining getting micro injury and that over time can get breakdown and eventually just disappear altogether, cartilage lining. And also when you develop bone hitting bone because the cartilage is now gone, you can imagine that's quite painful but also because bone hits bone, there's also other things that are dysregulated and you end up getting more bone formation. So the extra bone just keeps growing and causes, starts hitting other areas, other structures around and causes pain and deformity and usually joints get bigger. Wow. So this was very helpful. If I were to summarize it, arthritis is not just one disease. It's kind of a class of symptoms around joint inflammation. Exactly. And as you mentioned, there's hundreds of types of it. The most typical are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid. Osteo is very typical, 10% of the population. That's huge. Rheumatoid is 1% so still a significant number of people but not as frequent as osteo. And from what I'm hearing, it sounds like because osteoarthritis is weight-bearing joints, you get it from injury to joints or from overuse. Obviously genetics is a part of it. But it seems like it's much more of a, I guess for lack of a better word, it's much more of a mechanical, kind of a mechanically induced disease. We don't know for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Some sort of degenerative. Degeneration, mechanical, obesity is a risk factor. While rheumatoid arthritis... A lot of inflammation. A lot of inflammation. It's something much more... Modern immune. Your immune system is responding in some way. Exactly. Very cool. There you have it. Thank you.
