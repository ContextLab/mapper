So we have a piecewise linear function right over here for different intervals of x. G of x is defined by a line, although the line changes depending what interval of x we are actually in. And so let's think about its domain, and then we'll think about its range. So the domain of this, just as a review, the domain is a set of all inputs for which this function is defined. And our input variable here is x. So it's a set of all x values for which this function is defined. And we see here, anything negative six or lower, our function isn't defined. If x is negative six or lower than that, it doesn't fall into one of these three intervals, so there is no definition for it. It doesn't say, hey, do this in all other cases for x. It's just saying, look, if x falls into one of these three conditions, apply this, and if x doesn't fall into one of those three conditions, well, this function g is just not defined. So to fall into one of these three, you have to be at least greater than negative six. So this part right over here, the low end of our domain is defined right over there. So we could say negative six is less than x. And I'm leaving, so actually let me just write it here. All real numbers, actually let me write it this way. x, I could write it more math-y. I could say x is a member of the real numbers such that negative six is less than x. And let's think about the upper bound. So as x goes, and I just want to make sure that we fill in all the gaps between x being greater than negative six and x is less than or equal to six. So let's see, as we go up to and including negative three, we're in this clause. As soon as we cross negative three, we fall into this clause up to four, but as soon as we get to four, we're in this clause, up to and including six. So x at the high end, it says to be less than or equal to six. Less than or equal to six. Now another way to say this in kind of less math-y notation is x, x can be any real number, any real number such that, such that negative six is less than x, is less than or equal to six. These two statements are equivalent. So now let's think about the range of this function. Let's think about the range. And the range, this is the set of all inputs, or sorry, this is the set of all outputs that this function can take on, or all the values that this function can take on. And to do that, let's just think about as x goes, as x varies, or as x can be any of the values in this interval, what are the different values that g of x could take on? So let's think about that. g of x is going to be between what and what? g of x is going to be between what and what? g of x is going to be between what and what? And it might actually, this might be some equal signs there, but I'm going to worry about that in a second. So when does this thing hit its low point? So this thing hits its low point when x is as small as possible. And x is going to be as small as possible when it's approaching negative six. So if x were equal to negative six, it can't equal negative six here, but if x is equal to negative six, then this thing over here would be equal to negative six plus seven would be one. So if x is greater than negative six, g of x is going to be greater than one. Or another way of thinking about it, if negative six is less than x, then one is going to be less than g of x. And the whole reason I said that, if you just put negative six into this, negative six plus seven is equal to one. Now, this thing's going to hit a high end when it's as large as possible. The largest value in this interval that we can take on is x being equal to negative three. So when x is equal to negative three, negative three plus seven is equal to four, positive four. And it can actually take on that value because this is less than or equal to. So we can actually take on x equals negative three, in which case g of x actually will take on positive four. So let's do that for each of these. Now here we have one minus x. So this is going to take on its smallest value when x is as large as possible. So the largest value x can approach for, it can't quite take on for, but it's going to approach for. So if x, let's see, if we said x was four, although that's not this clause here, one minus x, one minus four is negative three. So as long as x is less than four, then negative three is going to be less than g of x. I want to make sure that makes sense to you because it's a little bit confusing because this takes on its minimum value when x is approaching its minimum value, when x is approaching its maximum value because we're subtracting it. So if you take the upper end, even though this doesn't actually include four, but as we approach four, we can say, okay, one minus four is negative three. So g of x is always going to be greater than that and it's always going to be less than, well, what happens as we approach x being equal to negative three? So one minus negative three is going to be positive four. So this is going to be positive four right over here. And these are both less than, not less than or equal to, because these are both less than right over here. And now let's think about this right over here. So two x minus 11 is going to hit its maximum value when x is as large as possible. So its maximum value is going to be hit when x is equal to six. So two times six is 12 minus 11. Well, that's going to be one. So its maximum value is going to be one and it's actually going to be able to hit it because x can be equal to six. And its minimum value is going to be when x is equal to four and it actually can be equal to four. We have this less than or equal sign right over there. So two times four is eight minus 11 is negative three. So g of x in this case can get as low as negative three when x is equal to four. So now let's think about all of the values that g of x can take on. So we could say, we could write this a bunch of ways. We could write g of x is going to be a member of the real numbers such that, let's see, what's the lowest value g of x can take on? G of x can get as low as negative three and it can even be equal to negative three. This one just has it being greater than negative three. But here it can be greater than or equal to negative three. So negative three is less than or equal to g of x and it can get as high as, it can get as high as, let's see, it's defined all the way to one and then, or I shouldn't say it's defined all the way to one. It can take on values up to one but it can also take on values beyond one. It can take on values all the way up to including four over here. So it can take on values up to and including four. So g of x is a member of real numbers such that negative three is less than or equal to g of x is less than or equal to four. So the set of all values that g of x can take on between and including negative three and positive four.
