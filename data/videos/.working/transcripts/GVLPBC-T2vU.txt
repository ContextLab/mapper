We're told the terms one through four of a sequence are shown below. Write the recursive formula for the sequence in two forms, including the initial term. So either we can use the form with the function notation and the initial term would be f of zero, or we could use what I would use like the term subscript notation, a sub zero. So pause this video, have a go at this before we do it together. So let's just start looking at what's going on here. So this is the first term, this is the second term, third term, and then fourth term here. It's a little confusing with that comma, but this is 1,377. And before this, we're going to have a zeroth term that we're going to want to figure out. But when we go from 51 to 153, well, first we have to figure out, is this an arithmetic sequence? Are we adding or subtracting the same amount? Or is that the difference changing, which means that we're probably multiplying, not always the case, but maybe multiplying by the same amount? Well, the difference seems to be expanding. And when you look at it, it looks like to go from 51 to 153, you multiply by three. You multiply by three again, and yes, you get to 459. And you multiply by three again. I'm doing this roughly in my, yeah, that looks about right. So it looks like what is happening here is every term, so f sub n, the nth term, is equal to the term right before that times three. So we could write three times f of n minus one. Or if we want to use the subscript notation here, I could write a sub n, the nth term, is equal to three times the term before it, the n minus first term. Now, what is f of zero a sub zero? Well, to go one term back, instead of multiplying by three, we just divide by three. Or another way of thinking about it is, what do we have to multiply by three to get to 51? Well, 51 divided by three is 17. So we could write f of zero is equal to 17. That's that initial condition, so to speak, or where we're starting from, or the initial term. Or we could write a of zero, a sub zero, is equal to 17. And we're done.
