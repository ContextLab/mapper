A bakery makes seven trays of cookies on Friday. Each tray holds 36 cookies. How many cookies does the bakery bake on Fridays? Pause this video and try to figure that out. Okay, so we have seven trays, seven trays, and each of them has 36 cookies. So it's really seven sets or seven groups of 36. So what we really wanna do is multiply seven times 36. Now there's a couple of ways we could do this. One way is to think about it. Well, that's the same thing as seven times. And instead of 36, 36 is the same thing as 30 plus six. And so here we can use the distributive property. We could multiply seven times 30 and seven times six to get, let me just do that separately. So we are going to have, keep track of the colors, we're gonna have seven times 30, and then we're gonna add that to seven times six. And so let me put the 30 here, 30 and then the six. And then what is that going to be? Well, this first part right over here, seven times three is 21. So seven times 30 is 210. And then seven times six is 42. And so now we're going to want to add these two together. What's 210 plus 42? Well, 210 plus 40 is 250, plus we have that other two. So this is going to be 252. So that's one way that you could approach it. Another way that you could think about it is you could take 36 and you could multiply it by seven, put the seven in the ones place right below the six. And then you can say, all right, first, this is going to be, let me use different colors here, seven times six, seven times six is 42. And then you can think about, well, what is seven times 30? Well, that's 210. And then you add everything together, same idea. Two plus zero is two, four tens plus one 10 is five tens. And then you have two hundreds, bring that down. You got 252 again. And it's interesting to see, it's really just different ways of writing the same thing. I really did seven times 30 plus seven times six, seven times 30 plus seven times six.
