Colin, what's your role here at Khan Academy? So I'm a developer on the data science team, so I work with a lot of the rest of the development team and the rest of the data science team to look at questions like, how do we get people learning new content as quickly as possible so that we can get them learning new things but not overwhelming them with things that are too difficult. I've also done things like working on the LearnStorm team and making the leaderboards and doing the data analysis and software development that we need to get people's leaderboards And so on getting people to learn at an optimal speed or optimal quickness, how is that related to data? Especially for people who think Khan Academy is a bunch of videos, they have some exercises, how does data help people learn as quickly as possible? So one thing that we can look at is, one of the things we were looking at was how long does it take people to complete missions? And missions are kind of the personalized guided exercises on Khan Academy. And so we can look at it among all people who are doing missions, what did their problem history look like? What problems have they done? Did they get them correct? Does it seem like they're just doing an extraordinarily large number of problems that look easy to them? Does it seem like they're just getting every problem wrong and we need to figure out some way to present them different content? And so we can look at people's paths through these various missions and then see, well, what are the sorts of things that we should tweak to maybe figure out a path that we can give people an accelerated way through a mission or where do we maybe need to add more content or figure out how to redirect people into a different mission path or things like that. And what does it look like on a day-to-day basis? I mean, how much of it is kind of science? How much of it is kind of software engineering? How much is it kind of a more business side, talking to the team or outside folks to figure out what to do? I think at Khan Academy we're pretty unique in the data science team in that we actually do a lot of engineering and a lot of that I think is because we're working with data that we often don't know how to make sense of. So what we need to do is try things so we can use our intuition to make the best guess about what we think will help people's learning and then we design a test among a small number of users to see is this really in fact increasing their learning and then make sure before we roll it out to everyone. So we have a very sort of empirical engineering approach to doing this, whereas in a lot of other organizations you might see something more like we're going to make complicated models of our data and go with that, but I don't think we know how to make complicated models of our particular sort of data yet, but of course we're working on that. And how does that reflect it in your day-to-day? What do you wake up in the morning? What's your day is like? Or your average day? My average day I probably spend most of my time doing software development and then some of my time, especially depending on which project I'm working in with the time, can be some sort of investigative things like looking at aggregate statistics on problem logs for instance and seeing what people have been doing and how the modifications that we've been testing out have been affecting that. And you don't typically work here. I mean you work here, but you're not typically in the office. Where do you work from? Yeah, normally I work remotely from New Jersey and I work most of the time in the co-working space over there, but communicate with people here through our internal company chat and through video chat and things like that. What have you found has been kind of the puts and takes of that working remotely? It's nice because you have sort of a lot of freedom with your time and where you want to work if I feel like- You don't have people bothering you asking to videotape you. Yeah, exactly. You get a lot of nice isolated time and working at different times is actually kind of cool because you get an uninterrupted block of time every morning to work in. But you lose a lot of that sort of face-to-face interaction that you go with people that's really- I mean we have such great people here that it's really a wonderful interaction that you're missing a sort of casual conversation. But overall working out? Yeah, it's working out. It's a lot of fun. I still get to interact with people on the daily basis from here. So yeah. And what were you doing before Khan Academy? I was a grad student and briefly a postdoc at Stanford. I did my PhD in biochemistry there. I did a lot of sort of work with data analysis and especially analysis of biological microscopy images and sort of that bridge the gap between doing a lot of more science-y side of data science but then also programming and statistics. And what made you come here? I mean, you know, it sounds like you could have been a professor of biochemistry someplace. Yeah, well two things. So one, I sort of- one thing that I really liked about science and especially the data analysis was like getting my hands dirty with the data and experiments and being able to do things on a day-to-day basis and not just like think or talk about them. And I realized that the further you go down that academic career path, the more it becomes abstract and further disconnected from the doing. And I really liked the doing aspect of things. And actually a friend of mine who is a huge fan of Khan Academy saw that there were job openings here and they were posting. He said, oh, you should totally apply for this. This would be great. It would be perfect for you. You'd love this. So that's how I found out about Khan Academy. Yeah. And what's the experience been like? What's been surprising to you? I'm just- I mean, I was expecting that there would be great people here to work with but I'm just constantly surprised by how wonderful and varied and just great people there are to work with here. That continues to surprise me every day. How awesome are people here? Yeah, it surprises me, especially considering where we started. We've been averaging up. Yeah, who is that guy? We've been averaging up for sure. And what are you excited about? I'm super excited since we just finished the LearnStorm finals. I'm super excited about LearnStorm right now. And for those who don't know, because people all over the planet will be- Oh, right. Yeah. So LearnStorm is a pilot Bay Area math competition that we started that the idea is not just to compete with math but learn and grow new things and get excited about learning new things and about realizing that you can learn anything. And so we had this hugely successful pilot competition in the Bay Area and I'm really excited about seeing where that goes next and how many people we can get excited about. Yeah, you played a huge role in it and we just had our kind of, as you mentioned, it wasn't about just kind of the classic math competition. It was celebrating grit and hustle and perseverance. We just had our celebration and you played a big role in that. So yeah, it was great fun and it was wonderful to see all of the students there who were just so excited about math and about learning, which was wonderful to see. Yeah, no, no, same here. Well, I think I speak for the whole team. It's been a huge pleasure to work with you and I can't wait to see where things go from here. Absolutely. It's been a great pleasure working here so far. So.
