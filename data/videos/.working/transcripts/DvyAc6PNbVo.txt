When we first met Sal Khan 18 months ago, he was working at home in a converted closet in the heart of Silicon Valley. The former hedge fund analyst had recently quit his job to do something that at the time sounded a bit strange. Right now I'm cash flow negative. He gave up a paycheck with a hefty ambition to help educate the world online. A lot of people thought I was kind of crazy. Obviously when every waking hour you have you would sneak into a room and make math videos and put them on YouTube people kind of question what's up. What originally started as some math tutoring for a cousin turned into a global phenomenon. The idea didn't seem so crazy anymore. Though Khan, a brilliant MIT and Harvard grad with a wife and two children to support, was slowly starting to run out of his savings. That's when he learned that one comet from the right man can change everything. And out of the blue endorsement from Bill Gates. There's a new website that I've just been using with my kids recently called Khan Academy K-H-N. Just one guy doing some unbelievable 15 minute tutorials. It was surreal. I mean it's one of those things where you know it's this person that you grew up knowing kind of almost a hero most of your life, all of your life. Soon Gates kicked in a million and a half dollars. He also won two million from Google. It had a contest to see who had the best ideas to better the planet. We did now have millions of dollars to essentially pursue the dream. A dream that's enabled him to post more than 2300 videos on a host of different subjects. From math to history to economics. It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet. Khan has expanded his approach to create a software platform for classrooms. And he's working closely with one local school district. Why don't you start with reviewing some of these and getting them out of the way. It was literally starting with me literally saying look my cousins have a problem. I think I have a solution for my cousin's problem. So I did it and it required pretty much no resources, a little bit of my time. It was like oh wait my cousins liked it and other people liked it. Let's keep going. With his new found fame and resources. This is the worldwide headquarters of the Khan Academy. Khan has been able to ditch the bedroom closet for an office. And he now has a small staff to take things to an even higher level.
