Let's talk about hypertension, and I'll write that here, hypertension. Hypertension basically means high blood pressure, and we actually categorize it in different groups. Let's use my blood pressure of 115 over 75 as an example. I had drawn a small figure for you where I had blood pressure on this side, and I had time on this side. I said that my blood pressure does something like that, where the peak is 115, this is the systolic blood pressure. I said that the lowest point is going to be, for me, 75, and that was my diastolic blood pressure. We know everyone has a different blood pressure, so let's organize blood pressures into groups. Let's figure out what group goes where. To do that, I'm going to draw a couple number lines. Let's imagine that I have here in brown, I'll do my systolic blood pressure on this side, and I'll do the diastolic on the other side. I'll do diastolic over here. We're going to actually put them next to each other. I'll try to make them about the same size like that. Let's say this is really high pressure, this would be like 200, and this is all in millimeters of mercury. At the very bottom would be zero, so let's make them kind of the same. That means that up here would be about 100, and this would be about 120, and this would be about 140, let's say, and maybe this is 160, and this is 180. I'm going to do the same thing here. Let's say this is about 100, except this time I'm going to go on the other side, let's say this is about 80, and maybe this is 60, 40, 20. Maybe I didn't draw it as well, but I think you get the idea. This is my number line, and the reason I drew the systolic numbers higher than the diastolic is because we know that generally speaking, or not generally speaking always, the systolic pressure is going to be higher than the diastolic pressure. That's why I separated it out. You can imagine that these numbers go up and these go down. I'm just being lazy and not drawing it all out. Let's say that my pressure is 115. This is my systolic pressure now. Let's do that one first. Where does that fit? On this number line, 115 would be about right here. Actually anything below 120 is actually in the green zone. This goes all the way down to zero. Let's say my systolic was 97 or 103. That would all be in the green zone. What I mean by that is I would say I do not have hypertension. I have no hypertension. That's a nice safe area to have your blood pressure in, in terms of hypertension. For diastolic pressures, we know that diastolic pressures are the low range of a blood pressure. Those numbers are going to be lower. Here anything below 80 is considered in that safe green zone. Below 80 is where you want to be. I want to be very specific. I don't mean to say that a blood pressure of five would be good. What I mean is that you don't have hypertension. You don't have high blood pressure. That's very different from having low blood pressure. Just for right now, the green zone in terms of high blood pressure. Let's say my systolic blood pressure was a little bit higher. Let's say it's between 120 and 140, somewhere in here. Then I'm in the yellow zone. That yellow zone means that I don't have hypertension, but I'm getting there. I'm getting closer and this would be pre-hypertension. On the other side, on the diastolic side, we use 90 as a cutoff. I'll write it 90. Anything between 80 and 90 would be in that yellow zone. That's your pre-hypertension zone. That's pre-hypertension. You're still not there yet. In terms of high blood pressures, again, you don't want high blood pressures, but in terms of getting there, if you're above 140, you have hypertension. This zone in here, 140 to 160 in particular, is considered stage one hypertension. Stage one. Between 90 and 100 for diastolics, that would be stage one. Stage one. Now if you have something above 160 for your systolic blood pressure, I'll just say above 160. That means even higher than 200. Let's say you have 201. That would be stage two. You can see that the higher you go, the higher your stage number. The same is true on this side. Let's say you have a really high diastolic blood pressure, well above 100. You'd have stage two hypertension all the way down there. This is stage two. I'm just going to do a couple quick examples for you. Let's say I'll do them in yellow, a different color. Let's say that you have 145 as a systolic and your diastolic is, let's say, 87. Well, 145 is right here. 87, actually, you'd need to do it in the same color just to be consistent. So 145 is right here. And 87 is in here. So your systolic pressure is stage one hypertension and your diastolic pressure is in pre-hypertension. So when you're in different stages for the diastolic and the systolic, what you do, the rule, is that you go with the higher stage. So in this case, stage one is higher. So this person would be considered stage one hypertension. Now we can do one more example just to make sure you get it. So let's do a different color. Let's say I'll do the next one in red. So you have, let's say, 126 over, let's say, 101. Well, this person, 126, is actually right here. And 101 is right above the 100 mark, right there. So this person is actually pre-hypertensive if you're looking at just their systolic value, but they're actually in stage two hypertension if you're looking at their diastolic value. So overall, they're going to be in stage two because the rule, again, is that you go with the higher stage. So that's how you figure out what stage of hypertension someone's in.
