We saw in the last video that if I have some orthonormal basis, orthonormal, I should have a shorthand for this, if I have an orthonormal basis, then to find for, let me say, for subspace v, then if I want to find the projection of some vector x in Rn onto v, the transformation matrix simplifies to a times a transpose, a times a transpose times x, where a is equal to essentially, or exactly, the matrix with the basis vectors as columns. So let's say v1, v2, all the way through vk. These are the basis vectors, basis orthonormal, maybe I'll write it like this, orthonormal basis vectors for v. We saw this in the last video, and that was another reason why we like orthonormal bases. Let's do this with an actual concrete example. So let's say v is equal to the span of the vector, let's say 1 third, 2 third, and 2 thirds, and the vector 2 thirds, 1 third, and minus 2 thirds. Now, we've already seen that these two guys are linearly independent, and they both have length 1, and they're both orthogonal to each other. So if we say b, so we could say the set, let me write it this way, we call this vector 1 for shorthand, if that's v1, and this is v2, we know that the set of v1 and v2 is an orthonormal basis for v. Now, we want to use this result to find the projection. We want to find the transformation matrix for the projection of any vector x in R, well in this case it's going to be in R3, onto R subspace, onto v. And the subspace is going to be a plane in R3. So what's it going to be? Well, we found the result that we just have to construct. We have to construct a matrix A, which has these guys as the column vectors. So 1 third, 2 thirds, 2 thirds, and 2 thirds, 1 third, and minus 2 thirds. And if we construct A in that way, then the projection of x onto v, this linear transformation, can be represented as A times A transpose times x. So to find our transformation matrix, we just have to multiply this guy times his transpose. So let's do that. Let me just copy and paste this. Let me do it right here. Paste it. So that's A. I need to multiply that times A transpose. A transpose is just going to be 1 third, 2 third, 2 third, 1 third, 2 thirds, 1 third, and then 2 thirds minus 2 thirds. 2 thirds minus 2 thirds. That's A transpose. So what is this going to be equal to? So we have a 3 by 2 times a 2 by 3 matrix. So it's going to result in a 3 by 3 matrix, which makes sense because this thing right here should be a mapping from R3 to R3. You give me some member of R3, and I'm going to give you another member of R3 that is in my subspace v and is kind of the projection of x onto v. And we've also seen it's the closest member of the 2x. So what is this going to be? It's going to be a 3 by 3 matrix. And so this first term right here, we're going to dot this guy with this guy. So it's going to be 1 third times 1 third, which is 1 ninth, plus 2 thirds times 2 thirds. So it's going to be 1 ninth plus 4 ninths. So I think we're going to be dealing with a lot of ninths here, so let me just divide everything by ninth. It's going to be 1 ninth plus 4 ninths, which is 5 ninths. But I'll just write a 5 here and just know that we're going to divide everything by 9 in the end. So that's that guy dotted with that guy. Now let's take the dot of this guy with this guy. I'm going to get 2 ninths plus 2 ninths. That's 4 ninths. Now I'm going to dot this guy with this guy. 2 ninths minus 4 ninths. That is minus 2 ninths. Now let's take the dot of this row. We're in the second row, and then we're going to have the dot of 2 thirds and 1 that is 2 ninths, 2 ninths plus 2 ninths. That is 4 ninths. So we'll put a 4 there. We have 4 ninths. Then we have 2 ninths plus 1 ninth is 3 ninths. Let me make sure I got that right. 2 ninths, oh no, sorry, 2 thirds times 2 thirds is 4 thirds. So 2 thirds times 2 thirds is 4 ninths plus 1 ninth is 5 ninths. And then we have 4 ninths minus 2 ninths is 2 ninths. And then let's do this last one. We're almost there. I hope you already appreciate this. It's a lot less painful than we had to take A transpose A and then inverse it in between. We're just taking A times A transpose. So 2 thirds times 1 third. So that's 2 ninths minus 4 ninths. That's minus 2 ninths. And then we have 4 ninths minus 2 ninths. That's 2 ninths. And then we have 4 ninths plus 4 ninths. So that is 8 ninths. So just like that, we were able to figure out the transformation matrix for the projection of any vector in R 3 onto our subspace V. And this was a lot less painful than the ways that we've done it in the past.
