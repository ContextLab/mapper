We're told that the sum of three consecutive odd integers is 231. What is the largest integer? So let's think about this a little bit. Let's say that x is the smallest integer. x is equal to the smallest odd of these three, it's not the smallest odd integer of all integers, it's the smallest odd of these three, the smallest odd integer. So what's the next one going to be? Well, if I have one odd integer, what's going to be the next odd integer? Let's think about this. If x was three, what's the next odd integer? It's five. And then what's the next one after that? It's seven. And the next one after that, it's nine. So every time we add two. So if the smallest one is x, the next smallest odd integer is x plus two, is equal to the next smallest odd integer. I'll write integer here. Odd integer. And then what will be the next one? Well, we're going to add two to this one, right? So it's going to be x plus four. Think about it. If the smallest is three, then we have x plus two, which is five, and then you have x plus four, which is seven. So this will be the largest of the consecutive odd integer in this group. And they tell us that the sum of these consecutive odd integers is 231. What is the largest integer? If I take x, x plus two and x plus four, and I sum them, they should be equal to 231. So let's do that. So we have x plus two plus x plus four, and this just needs to be equal to 231. And when they ask us what's the largest one, we're going to have to tell them what x plus four is equal to. So let's just solve this equation. So let's add our x terms. We have one x, two x, three x's. So we get three x plus, and then what are our constants? We have a two and we have a four. So three x plus six is equal to 231. Now let's get rid of the six from the left-hand side of the equation. The best way to do that is to subtract six from both sides. So let's subtract six from both sides. The left-hand side, we're just left with a three x. Just left with a three x, the sixes cancel out. The right-hand side, 231 minus six is 225. We get three x is equal to 225. To isolate the x, let's just divide both sides by three. The left-hand side, the threes cancel out. That was the whole point behind dividing by three. We get just an x. It's being equal to 225 divided by three. Let me do it over here. So three goes into 225. It goes into 22 seven times. Seven times three is 21. 22 minus 21 is one. Bring down the five. Three goes into 15 five times. Five times three is 15. Subtract, no remainder. 225 divided by three is 75. The smallest of the odd integers is 75. This one is 75. What's x plus two going to be equal to? That's going to be two more, 77. What's x plus four going to be equal to? That's the largest of them. x is 75 plus four is going to be 79. Notice we have three odd integers. They're consecutive. They're the odd integers that come directly after each other. Let's verify that when we add them up, we get 231. If we get 75 plus, let me just write it like this, 75 plus 77 plus 79, I want to add them all up. Five plus seven is 12. 12 plus nine is 21. Carry the two. Two plus seven is nine. Nine plus seven is 16. 16 plus seven is 23. There you have it. The three consecutive odd integers, when you add them up, you got 231. They're consecutive and odd. They ask what's the largest? The largest is 79.
