We're here at CNBC family and here at CNBC we want to give our viewers the chance to learn more about finance. Hope you understand where exactly your money is going. Joining us now in the studio is Sal Khan, founder and executive director of the Khan Academy. He's also the mind behind dozens of videos featured on CNBC.com that help explain financial concepts. So what exactly are you doing? What's your initiative? Yeah, so Khan Academy itself, it's really just started me with me trying to tutor cousins and I put my videos on YouTube and they got popular. And so I quit my old job and I started doing videos on algebra and calculus and all the rest and I even did a few on economics and finance and so CNBC contacted me and said, hey, we want you to do more of that and explain what is a credit default swap or what is the difference between preferred equity and regular equity and what is the difference, what is the net present value of something? Is it true anecdotally that you got letters from bankers who said that you saved them from getting fined so they could learn more about that? Yeah, that happened again last week. I was at a... Confidence building. Confidence building, but at least they had that. At least they had... No, I had someone who worked in mortgage backed securities. Isn't that the truth that people out there who people think they know, they think they're supposed to know these things and most people really don't. There's so much out there. And what I say is the more jargon someone uses, the less likely they actually know the underpinnings of what... And so yeah, I mean, I think there are a lot of people who say the mortgage backed security industry who are signing the documents, getting them stamped by the rating agency and knowing what was going on in the big picture. Last week you were talking about how there's the need for more understanding and education about ETFs. How much interest do you see in people educating themselves about ETFs? About everybody. Yeah, ETFs, one of them, I didn't do a video on that, but it's one of those things a lot of people say, oh, it's this thing I can buy that tracks some index. You don't really understand what it is. But how does it work? Is it a mutual fund? Is it closed end? Is it open end? Is it something in between? And so that's what I try to do, is just to break it down, draw it out and explain it. So your site is ad free. It is ad free. We're not for profit. So we get the Gates Foundation, Google have funded us, and so yeah, kids can learn algebra without ads. And the economics of a cupcake factory. And the economics of a cupcake factory. Which is actually one of your videos. Yes, and we go into predatory pricing. But how do you get the ideas then? Somebody come say, I want to open up a cupcake factory, but I have no idea what the economics of said factory would be, and therefore you make a video? How do you decide? You know, some of those things like the cupcake factory, my old job as an analyst at a hedge fund, I had another company in mind, but I just changed their industry when I talked about predatory prices and cupcakes, because it seemed much more benign. Very mysterious. Very mysterious. Well, thank you for coming on, Sal. Yeah, thanks for having me. Khanacademy.org, you have some crazy classes on here. Yes. That's the craziest. Yeah, very cool stuff. Photosynthesis. In case you're interested. Photosynthesis? We wouldn't know about that, because we don't have any sunlight. No, no. I don't know what skylight here is. I'll get my plants to watch it. Sal, thank you very much. Appreciate you coming in. All right, learning a lot. Rockafeller Plaza has been transformed for the summit, and that's where we find Michelle Caruso Cabrera, along with two leading innovators in their respective fields. Take it away, Michelle. Do some of the coolest and most interesting people I've met in a really long time, joining me here at Education Nation down here at 30 Rock. N.T. Ettuk is the founder of Dimension U. This is an educational video game company that he started. He used to be at Citigroup, and he's rolling out a lot of exciting things, and Sal Khan joins us as well. He's the founder of the Khan Academy. This is an educational video and software company. You both have the same idea, which is that you want to go directly to the customers. You're not selling to schools. You're not selling to parents, necessarily, right? Well, actually, we do have a component where we sell to schools. It's been proven, well, first of all, we do multiplayer education video games. Imagine Halo minus the violence, but allowing a kid in Seoul, Korea, to play against a kid in New York City while they're learning math, literacy, science, history. We started out selling to schools. We have large portion of New York City public schools, etc. Now we're going to the consumer side. I guess my thought was, you really want to get the kids to like it, because historically, educational video games have been boring. That's exactly right. And textbooks, and so are workbooks. If you can do video games, then they're like, hey. That they really want to play. That they want to play. You can incentivize them to learn, and it's fantastic. Wow. Sal, tell me about the Khan Academy. This is a good idea. Once again, we're not selling. We're not for profit, so that's our goal. Go build a small house. Okay. But no, but we are. Our target is the students. And any aid is in them. We have six-year-olds. We have homeschoolers. We have people who are using supplemental. And they're getting them where? YouTube? Or how are they getting the product? It's off of YouTube, khanacademy.org. YouTube is just the videos. We have most of our resources on making a software platform. It has a little bit of games in there, but so students can practice everything that they might learn in the videos, too. And it goes all the way through calculus. Yeah. Does it matter if it's profit, not for profit? From my perspective, for profit is how you keep sustainability going. I think that there's a great way to actually make a tremendous amount of money while doing good at the same time. And so that's what we do. How is rollout going? So you are now selling to schools. Are you getting schools involved? And is it easier to sell to charter schools and things like that? Are they more adaptable as opposed to public schools that have a longer kind of purchase cycle? Yeah. Well, most of our users are like, we have about two and a half million students a month. Those are mostly just independently using it. But we have started pilots. The Los Alto School District in Silicon Valley, they're district-wide with it. They're public school. They're not a charter school or anything like that. We are piloting with some charter schools, some private schools public. And we're just trying to see how we can use this thing that's fundamentally for our independent learners, but how we can use it in classrooms, too. Are either one of you providing backbone analytics to the schools so that you know that it works? Yes. Absolutely. Very, very important. So how long are the students playing? What are they getting right and wrong? But we actually can go even deeper. We can understand if a student plays primarily by themselves or whether they play with others. So are they a social learner or are they an individual learner? And then you know how you can help with tutoring or whatever else. So a whole bunch of analytics that gets right. So all of their... Yeah, no. That's the model that we're trying in the classrooms. The lectures aren't giving... And the teachers aren't giving lectures anymore. They're not creating homework. The students are all working at their own pace and the teacher gets a dashboard. And how does the students that are stuck? So the teacher is now able to do these one-on-one interventions or get the peers to teach each other. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But what about schools that don't have resources? Are they less likely to get this stuff? Well, so from our perspective, that's one of the reasons why we went to the consumer side, much like we're doing a free model. You know, for the consumer side. For the consumer side. For the consumer side. But kids at home can get it. But kids at home can get it for free. Then we actually make money through microtransactions. So it's somewhat like Zynga, you know, etc. So that sort of thing as we roll that out. So it's going to be very interesting. How about you, Saul? Yeah, no. It's a... It's... Yeah, we do... We... I'm sorry for... We were talking about... Don't worry about it. Should people be hopeful about education? Yes. We've talked so long about how we've been failing careers in this country. Absolutely. And you've been very optimistic? Very. Here's the problem. The problem right now with the innovation conversation in education is it's tiring. We could have had this conversation 300 years ago. Yeah. What we have is Google, iPod, iPod, iPad, all of these sorts of technology to come in and we can get rid of the traditional distribution structures, go directly to the kids, or go directly to the teachers and build it up some of the... A real product that they want to use. Saul, last word. Yeah, no, the same thing. And just some of the questions about the technology. And I think right now there's a healthy skepticism of why do you use technology in the classroom. And I think what we're talking about is now you have a reason to use it. And once you have a good reason, it's actually not that expensive anymore. You have a $300 laptop. You could use it for five years at $60 a year and 10 kids could use it. And 10 kids could use it. $6 per kid per year. Textbooks, which could be far more expensive. Far more expensive. Guys, thank you so much for that wonderful conversation I have with you. Thank you. Tyler, back to you.
