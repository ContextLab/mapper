Hey everybody, it's Dan from the Khan Academy team and today I'll be showing y'all a brief introduction to our chat history feature. So what is chat history? Well, if you've ever been using Khanmigo and for whatever reason, maybe you've navigated to another activity like I do here, but you really wanted to continue the conversation you're having, then chat history is just what you're looking for. The way we get to chat history is by clicking on this top right menu, then clicking on the chat history option. This will automatically open up a new tab with your chat history page, a sub page of your learner home. So here's some fun facts about chat history. Any teacher or parent account linked to your learner account can see your chats. For student safety, you cannot delete your chats and chats will be saved with your local time along with a helpful summary and title to help you remember what each chat was. Now if you navigate into your chat, you can then reread your conversation or if you click on restore this chat on the top left, you'll be sent back to your original location and your conversation will be resumed. I hope this helps and onwards.
