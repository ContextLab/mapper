This is Sal here and I'm at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Andy Connolly. Hi there Sal, I'm here with you to discuss histology today. Histology, and forgive me for what is probably a silly question, but what is histology? So it will be the ology study of, in this case, histo means tissues. I see, I see. So we're going to be looking at the cellular components of organs. Cool, cool. Yeah, this looks neat. What is this? So what we're going to be looking at today is the histology of the colon. And so for the colon, we often have colon specimens come to me in pathology. I'm a pathologist. I see, right, right. And so the colon, like we were saying before, is the large intestine. Right. And so if you have this piece of large intestine, often it's removed from the patient because there's an area of cancer. I see, I see. Or something that might be cancer. They don't know. So it might be cancer. They're actually pretty good now about doing colonoscopy, looking from the inside. I see. Okay, so if they know it's cancer, that's what it comes to you. They'll often have looked inside, think it looks like cancer, take a little piece and send it to us beforehand. I see. And then we say something and then they remove the piece. And the reason why they want to send it to you is even if they know it's cancer, how severe is this cancer? How severe is the cancer? They also really want to get a good tissue diagnosis to make sure if they're going to go remove a piece of your colon, that they really know that it's cancer rather than it just sort of looks like it. I see, I see. So it's the definitive proof before they remove it. Cool, cool. So then if this is the cancer that's removed, they clearly want to be able to check the margins to make sure it's been removed in its entirety. Right. But often inside of there, we'll find other pieces of tissue, like here's, it might be a polyp. Right. And when you say check the margins, this is literally just making sure that you've covered enough material that you've gotten all of the cancer in it that you're not kind of cutting through the cancer or you've missed some of it. That's right. Because this is actually one of the traditional surgical cures of cut it out to cure. Right. And for colon cancer, that tends to still be the case. Right, right. You will cut it out to make sure you cure. There are many other kinds of cancers, though, which spread so widely early on that you don't usually cut out. Right, yeah, yeah. Makes sense. So the polyp can be found also in a piece of colon removed, and a polyp is something that just sticks up. It's just sticking up. Okay, so any tissue that kind of sticks out like that? Yeah. It's not necessarily cancer. No. So for instance, another common place you hear about is some people in the sinuses might have sinus troubles, and they'll have a sinus polyp. Those almost always are just inflamed. Okay. So, like I said. We'll find areas in which it's just, you know, the lining is a little bit roughened, and we'll take sections of those. I see. And that can happen just from someone being allergic to food or just overuse irritation. Yeah, so just irritation in certain sites. So we're going to have the areas where it's kind of irritated, some in which there's a polyp, something sticking out. Right. We want to really look at it on the microscope. Right. And then the thing which would probably they were mainly worried about, the cancer. Right, I see. Very cool. So what we're going to cover in the slides that we look at today. So this first one we're looking at is an example of normal margin. And so it's from a little piece from the edge. So they actually call the tissue margin. Yeah, tissue margin. I see. I see. So this is normal tissue. So this is the edge of the specimen or the margin of the specimen. Right. And they'll say, is the margin clear? I see. And in this case, this is an example in which, yeah, the margin is clear. And this is normal looking colon. I see. And so this is a cross section crossing the boundary of the colon. So this area up top right here, this is literally the inside of the colon where the, I don't know what the medical term for the poop. Yeah, so the stool. Yeah, stool. Right. So it's not authoritative. So yeah, that's the stool in the middle. Right. And then the supportive tissues are underneath. I see. This is essentially part of the structural tissue of the tube. Yeah, that's right. Okay. All right, so let's now drive around the slide. This is a virtual slide in which we took the typical glass microscope slide and put it in a special machine which took lots and lots of photographs of high power and stitched them all together as one massive image. I see. So that then allows you to zoom in and look around. And just to get my own bearings, this polyp, or this is not even a polyp. No, this is just a regular roll. This is regular tissue. It's a little bit of a fold. A little bit of a fold, but this isn't a polyp. So this distance right here, what would that be, like a centimeter? Yeah, about like that. Okay. So it would probably be, if I had to guess, five or six millimeters based on the size of the glass. Okay, half a centimeter. Okay. So now to drive around. What you'll see is you'll begin to see me driving around with this arrow. And these are the controls for the program for zooming in and out. Okay. And so if I'm going to zoom in and out, you can see I click on something and what it'll be able to do is look at something more closely. And this gives us the looking at the – and the word here is mucosa. They're very similar to mucus. Right. So the idea of mucosa is it's the lining that makes the mucus. I see. It's the slimy part. I see. So it's literally – and it looks like what this stuff out here is. Oh, I need to draw – that light stuff up there. That stuff right there. So this stuff up here is the slimy mucus. And so it keeps the linings of the insides from drying out because it's a very hydrated gel. Right, right. But it also means that things can glide along without abrading the surface. I see. And so we have there – and then when you look at it, it has architecture in which these are glands. They're like test tubes sticking down. Right. And the purpose is to increase the surface area. And the term gland, you hear a lot in medicine, is just any structure that's containing fluid and can release the fluid. What is a gland? And so a gland is an epithelial structure. So it's made of cells that are packed tightly. And the cells have a top and a bottom. Right. And they're formed into some sort of in-folding or structure so that there's a middle and then there's an outside. Okay, through that structure. Through that structure. Through that structure. And when you say it's an epithelium, it's kind of like the stuff that's facing the outside world. Yeah. So the epithelium is a special class of cells in which they are facing the outside world, once again, tightly packed. Right. And there's always a top and there's a bottom. I see. And even though to a lay person, this area right here might not seem like the outside world. It seems like it's inside of you. It's kind of like big donuts. That's right. And the colonoscopist proves that it's connected to the outside world. Exactly, right. The colonoscopist, yeah, they can come right in here. They can come right in there. Right. So that is still the outside world. Pain and expense. Right. So that's still the outside world. And so this is the architecture where you have in-foldings to increase the surface area and it's creating this mucus. But let me look at the highest power here, which is to then look at these cells. Oh, I mess around. This is cool. So yeah, when we look at these cells, there are two main kinds of cells. There's this one here, which is the goblet cell. Goblet cell, right. And so this is – and it's this whole – it's not just this white part. It's the part that goes all the way down there. Yeah. Here, let me have that pen. Let me have that pen. Here are the experts. And so here it is. It's got a top like that. And then you see this wine glass. Oh, okay. So that wine glass there. That's the goblet. Oh, it's literally shaped like a goblet. Yeah. I was circling the wrong handle. No, you got the wrong nucleus there. The wrong nucleus. That's where some other cups on the goblet, someplace else. So what's next to it though, are there these thin cells here, which do not have all the mucus inside of them? Where are those? And these guys here are just these tall ones. Oh, I see. Okay. And you only see the nucleus. The dark part is the nucleus. And that's why you don't see it. The white part is just all this mucus inside of the cell. Right. So this is actually, mucus is the term for either the overall structure or the material that's elaborated up here. I see. Chemically, it's something called mucin. I see. And what mucin is, it's almost like the runners who eat that goo, where it's just a lot of sugar holding a lot of water. I see. It'd just be bad branding if they call it mucus in a bag. Yeah, no, no. Exactly. So they stick with goo. We'll call it that. That's what it is. But this one, it has lots of sugars. It takes on a lot of water. And that's mucin. That's released, and it forms this surface on here. Right, to let the stuff flow by. What the other cell does, though, is the other main thing, in addition to letting things flow through, is to absorb water. I see. So the idea is you don't want to release the two liters of fluid that you have around every one of your reels. Right. You want to get a lot of that fluid back. That's the main use of the large intestines. That is. To absorb the water out. It's a consolidation process. Right, out of the stool. That's right. Out of the stool. So you want to get a lot of the water and see you're going to be doing it through these cells here. Just to be clear, I'll do this in blue. The mucin would come out here, and then the water would be absorbed by these things that don't have that mucin part. So it would be absorbed right there or right over there. Actually maybe right over there. Yeah, that's exactly right. So two main functions of the colon are right there with those two cells. So now, going back to the... And actually, just to get a perspective of where we are, I understand that the whole thing is about half a centimeter wide. What's our scale? Like how big are one of these cells? Okay, so our favorite scale bar here is actually to look for blood vessels. And the blood vessel is... These are red blood cells. Oh wow. So that one right there is seven micrometers in diameter. Seven micrometers. And a micrometer is a millionth of a meter or a thousandth of a millimeter. That's right. So it's seven thousandths of a millimeter. So it's round off to 10. Yeah, so about a hundredth of a millimeter. That's right. So you put a hundred of these next to each other, you get a millimeter. So a millimeter would be bigger than our entire screen right here. That's right. So you'd see that with these glands, a millimeter would be about this kind of span, which we're saying up here is about like that. So that's why I was thinking this thing might be from here to here about seven millimeters across. Right, right. Something like that. But red blood cells are found in almost every microscopic field and they're always seven micrometers. Wow, that's useful. Yep. I think I got that going for you. So when looking here, you've got this is very well formed. You can see here these tubular glands. Just a hint over here is because they're like test tubes, sometimes they're not going straight up and down and they look a little at an angle like they'd be going up. Oh, so but they actually are reaching the surface. They are. We just don't see it based on the way that it was cut. So this one right over here, for example, this, it was just cut at an angle. So it looks like it's embedded there on this two dimensional. But in three dimensional, we would see an actual tube dropping out. And just to go back with the microscopy, we're seeing this because it's only four microns thick. So four micrometers thick and we're sending white through this tissue. So that's why you can get something which the cross section doesn't show you the three dimensions. Right, right. Very much a two dimension. Fascinating, fascinating. Cool. So and so this is what a healthy, a healthy, I guess, a margin tissue would look like. Yeah, this is a healthy colon. And so you would thankfully say on the proximal margin, which is up towards more towards the mouth, that's clear. You take another section like this from the distal margin more towards the end and you say that's clear. So that means they've removed it all. And when you said proximal margin is close to the mouth, you're not saying you're saying the mouth of that cut that. Yeah. Yeah. So if this is if that was the tube, you're saying close to the mouth of the person. No, no, we're not. We're not at all. You're saying mouth of the section of tubing. That's right. So the proximal distal margins are clear if they look like this. Very good. Excellent.
