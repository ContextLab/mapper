This is Sal again. I'm here at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Abraham Verghese. And what are we going to talk about? We're going to talk about the ritual of the physical exam, the bedside exam. The physical exam. The ritual. Why do you call it a ritual? That's interesting that you call it a ritual. Yeah, I think the lesson I've learned from hanging around with my anthropology colleagues here at Stanford is that rituals are all about transformation. A ritual signals the crossing of a threshold. We baptize to signal the crossing of a threshold. We marry to signal our departure from a life of solitude, loneliness and misery to one of eternal bliss. So our lives are full of... You shouldn't be laughing, Sal. No! It resonates so strongly with you. So crossing a threshold is why we have a ritual. And I would say that the act of one individual coming to another and telling them things they wouldn't tell their rabbi or their preacher, and then incredibly disrobing and allowing touch. I would say that that signals a ritual of incredible importance. And the fact that we in the postmodern sort of medical world have stopped seeing it that way and just see it as sort of another data gathering tool may work for us. Yes, but I don't think it works for the patient. And I think that a major disconnect between us and our patients is our failure to see what they see, which is a profound ritual in which they're highly invested. And when we then come and just stick our stethoscope on top of the shirt or don't examine them thoroughly, we are sort of shortchanging ourselves of an important ritual. Yeah, I now feel shortchanged. Yeah. Okay, okay. No, no, sorry. It's tough to list for you if I may, those aspects of what make this a ritual. So if you look at it, first of all, there's always a specialized space. You don't examine a patient out in the corridor. It's always a special room, a ceremonial room, if you will. Mysterious looking objects on the walls, a very specialized bed that you sit on. So, you know, that's another, those are all signals that this is a ritual. Then when the physician walks in, the physician often is wearing a ceremonial garb, which happens to be a white coat. Fascinating. Yeah, no, this is interesting. Just from an anthropological point of view, I never, you know, you just, yeah. The physician wearing ceremonial garb and the patient is also instructed to disrobe and, you know, gets a patient garb. Yes. Both participants clearly have a ritual. Which seems specially designed to put patients in a position of weakness. I know, I know. We should be rethinking the kind of a balanced measure. Yes, I think there's a little, yeah. And then the physician then begins a systematic exam, which at some level is mysterious to the patient. It's not always clear to the patient why the physician is thumping on their chest or why the physician is saying take a deep breath or cross your arm, you know, stand on tiptoe or take your hand and touch your nose, wrap it up. Yeah. So there's, there are mysterious and ritualistic aspects to it. And very often the physician is using terms that are somewhat Latinate. Right. And arcane and utterly mysterious to the patient. Yeah. Such as, from it is and percussion and. What does from it is mean? From it is means you ask the patient to say 99 and you listen, you sort of put your hand on their chest and you pick up the vibration and if they have consolidation or collapse, the from it is not what it should be. Compared to the other side. The from it is. Yeah. So it was the sound or the. It's more like the vibration. Oh, the vibration. I see. Sound being transmitted through and being picked up by your hand. Interesting. Interesting. So and then the, the, the thing that's most interesting to me about the ritual is that the person coming in might be a policeman, a teacher, you know, an entrepreneur. But in the process of putting on that gown and sitting on that ceremonial chair, they have sort of been stripped of all that identity. Yeah. And they are taking on the identity of being the patient. Yeah. But conversely, I think there's something very important that happens, which is that just before this, the patient has been vocalizing all their symptoms and their complaints. And, you know, at that point, the physician could order 10 tests and, you know, go and look at the images. But there's something about the physician then laying hands on the patient. Right. That sort of gives weight to what the patient just talked about. Right. You talk about your belly hurting and then this individual carefully examines your belly. It's sort of. Right. It's sort of validating your soma. Right. Your body is being validated in this ritual. Right. And then, you know, when you finally have the tests all sent off, they become sort of what follows intuitively on the ritual. First, having it validated on your body. Yeah. One of the things that I, I bemoan sometimes is that at times the patient in the bed, I feel, in hospitals around America has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. Right. The entity in the computer. It's just something to interface with to get to that data structure in the computer. It's interesting. I've coined a term for that entity in the computer. It's the eye patient. Yeah. When the eye patient is getting fabulous care, the real patient, I think, has a need to feel their complaints validated. Yeah. To feel it validated on their soma. Right. And to engage in a ritual for which there's a transformation. And you might well ask me, what is the transformation that takes place in this ritual? And I think the transformation is the sense of the patient has delivered the story. Yeah. The physician in the process of the ritual has validated that they've heard the story and tried to locate it on the soma. And the transformation is really the ceiling of the patient-physician relationship. Wow. And so, you know, I think what has happened, Sal, unfortunately, is that because we have so much technology, we've become very sloppy in the way we examine patients. You know, I think that we could, we should be a hundredfold better at examining people, given that we have real-time feedback with echocardiograms, angiograms, and all that, instead of which I think people have never been less certain of their bedside skills. What about this phenomenon, just talking to physicians I know in my own family, that, you know, there's so much time pressure that there's, you know, they have to see so many patients, one every 15 minutes, and all of this. And they wish they could do this, but they'll say that, you know, I have so many other things to worry about in the paperwork and all of that. I mean, is it realistic to... I think that's a very real concern, but I think if you can do this well, and our goal at Stanford is to teach our students to do it very well, you actually save time. Right. Because if you do a quick exam and you find that they're tender in certain spots, you can order the test that sorts just that out, rather than, which I think is much more common, which is, I don't really know what's going on, I'll tick off every box, and maybe something will fall out of the sky. Right. And a directed exam not only fulfills the ritual, but if you're any good at it, it actually allows you to ask better questions of the test you order and minimize the patient's exposure to radiation. And, you know, I think the trouble is we get all these tests and we get back results we don't know what to do with, we stumble onto what we call incidental omas. Have you heard that term? Incidental omas. Well, I have heard that VIPs often get worse medical care because they do everything for them. Yeah, exactly. And they wind up with finding things they don't know what to do with them. Exactly. It leads to more. Yeah, over diagnosing things. But to come back to a ritual, I think we at Stanford are very proud to feel that as much as we represent, you know, this great bastion of technology and advancement, we also celebrate the fundamental ritual aspects of the patient-physician relationship, which is best symbolized in the physical exam. I think this is why a lot of physicians originally want to enter the field. Sometimes it's lost, but this is why they wanted to do it. And you're right. I think they often get disappointed when they learn to do this and arrive on the wards and find that no one's carrying a stethoscope and no one's carrying it. I mean, they carry a stethoscope. I think it's like a mating symbol. No, you got to carry one. But they don't carry the knee hammer and they don't carry all the other tools, which I once visited my wife and I wore her coat and I felt very good. Did you drape your stethoscope on the neck too? No, I did. Yeah, I looked very authoritative. That's a great signal that you arrived. So I think that we have so much to learn from our anthropology colleagues about the importance of ritual. I think sometimes we operate as though medicine is all about reason, but, you know, it's really reason, ritual, emotion, they all tie in together. This is art and science. No, this is fascinating. I'm going to reflect on some of the rituals I do now to see if they are. Very cool. Well, thank you for this. Thank you so much.
