As we saw in the last several videos, the Roman Republic that was established in 509 BCE, it finally met its end with the rule of Julius Caesar. We talk about Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon, becoming dictator for life. And then he is assassinated because of the power he was able to accumulate in 44 BCE on March 15th, the Ides of March, that throws Rome into a civil war. Eventually it becomes a battle between Augustus, or at the time Octavian, versus Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian is able to be victorious, and on 27 BCE he is declared, or this is the date that historians often use as the beginning of him officially being emperor. And this period from 27 BCE with Augustus being emperor, all the way to 180 CE, so this roughly 200 year period, this is a relatively good time for the Roman Empire. As we will see, there is still a lot of conflict, there is still a lot of bloodshed, but it is a relatively stable period. And so it is often referred to as Pax Romana, or the Roman Peace. And what we see pictured here, these are most of the emperors of that roughly 200 year period. Augustus proves to be a relatively good administrator. He lays a good foundation for the next several hundred years of the Roman Empire officially being ruled by an emperor. It's eventually going to meet its demise, the Western Empire at least in 476 CE. So it's gonna go for roughly 500 years, and Augustus lays a strong foundation for it. He's viewed as a strong administrator, he really builds a lot of institutions. From a historical perspective, it's worth noting that Jesus was born under Augustus' rule. And most historical views are Jesus was born in some place between 4 BCE and 6 BCE. Now Augustus was followed by Tiberius, and Tiberius here was both Augustus' stepson, and he married Augustus' daughter. So he was a stepson and son-in-law. And he also proved to be a relatively capable emperor. You can see Augustus had a fairly long rule. He took power in his 30s, and his power ended in his 70s. And Tiberius too had a fairly long rule from a historical point of view, or even a biblical point of view. It's worth noting that Jesus would have been crucified under Tiberius' rule. The Roman emperor referred to in the New Testament is Tiberius, it would have been his governor, Pontius Pilate, who orders the crucifixion of Jesus. Now after Tiberius, you have his great nephews, and so you, or his great-great-nephew. And you can see they're all not directly related, but they're all kind of family. And his great-great-nephew is Caligula. And Caligula, that's his nickname, is a bit of an infamous figure, one of the infamous figures in history amongst the Roman emperors, because he's really viewed as a sadist, as a pervert. He's known for killing people just for fun, and he is quickly assassinated. His term only, or his power only lasts for several years. And then in his place is put his uncle Claudius. After Claudius comes another infamous figure of history, and that is Nero. Nero, he's known for, Rome had a significant fire in 64 AD. Many of the Roman citizens believed that Nero did it intentionally to clear out space for a palace. Significant number of Romans died in that fire. He killed a ton of people, including his mother. He's maybe most famous for persecuting Christians. There are some accounts that he would dip them in oil and set them on fire in his garden, just as a source of light. So these people, you know, just to say that they were insane or demented or sick, you know, normally I try to avoid making any judgment on some of these historical figures, but both Caligula and Nero, if we believe the accounts that we get from that period and that shortly after that period, we're not by any stretch of the imagination good people. Nero eventually does commit suicide. And with Nero's end, you actually have the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Let me write that down. Julio, Julio-Claudian, Claudian dynasty. And the reason why it's called the Julio-Claudio dynasty is that all of these characters, so let me circle over or underline them. So all, all of, let me, all of these characters right over here are essentially from the same family. They're a descendant from both the Julian line, Julius Caesar, and the Claudian family. So that's why it's called the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Now at the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, you have a new dynasty, Vespasian. There's a short civil war. So the Pax Romana is not without some war and bloodshed. In fact, this whole time, there's a lot of relatives being killed, people who might threaten the emperor being killed, and that's just talking about the Romans themselves. They're constantly fighting the Germanic tribes and groups in the Middle East and taking more and more and more territory. These are extremely bloody things. They're constantly enslaving people. The Roman Empire, sometimes it looks like this neat, clean, idealistic thing, but there was a lot of enslaving of people, destroying of towns, killing people out of paranoia or really just out of the joy of killing if you take the case of Caligula or Nero. So then you have the Flavian dynasty. I don't have the three Flavian emperors depicted right over here. You have Vespasian, you have Titus, and you have Domitian. Of note, the Colosseum, the famous Colosseum in Rome, was built during their time. They're also known for the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. And then after that, you have what historians and especially Nicola Machiavelli, so this is many centuries later, call the good emperors. And the good emperors are these characters. Let me square them off right over here. And these are really the last five emperors of the Pax Romana. And we should even use the term good, maybe in quotation marks, because for Rome's enemies, for the slaves of Rome, for the people who were thrown into the Colosseum, just because they were a prisoner of war or they committed some simple crime, the Roman Empire didn't seem good. But the reason why they were viewed good is they were viewed as able administrators. They continued to expand the Roman Empire. Trajan in particular, the peak of the Roman Empire comes, in terms of geography, comes under Trajan's rule. That's this map right over here. This is the largest geographic extent that the Roman Empire takes on. Trajan is succeeded by Hadrian, most known for Hadrian's Wall here, the upper bound of the Roman Empire. And then the Pax Romana ends with Marcus Aurelius, who is viewed as a, he's actually wrote Meditations, he's a philosopher-emperor, he's viewed as one of the last great Stoic philosophers. And so with that, you have the end of this period of Pax Romana. And as we'll see in the next few videos, we then start really getting into the decline of at least the Western Roman Empires. We'll see the Eastern Roman Empire. Outlives the West by a good thousand years.
