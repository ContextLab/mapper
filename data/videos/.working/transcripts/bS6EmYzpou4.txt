We're told that Jared is twice the age of his brother Peter. So Jared is twice the age of his brother Peter. Peter is four years old. And Jared is twice the age of his brother Peter. So Jared is twice Peter's age of four. And then they tell us, Talia's age is three times Jared's age. How old are Talia and Jared? So Talia's age is three times Jared's age. So let's write this down. We have Peter is four years old. So Peter's age, he's four years old. Jared is twice the age of his brother Peter. So Jared, let me do that in yellow. So Jared is twice the age of his brother. So twice is the same thing as two times the age of his brother. You could say Jared is twice the age of his brother or Jared is two times the age of his brother. Well his brother is four. They told us that right over there. So Jared is going to be two times four years old. And if you know your multiplication tables, you know that's the same thing as eight. Two times four is eight. Four times two is eight. Or you know this is the same thing as Peter's age twice, which is the same thing as four plus four. That would also get you eight. So this would give you, so Jared's age is equal to eight. And then finally they say Talia's age, and they tell us right over here it's three times Jared's age. So Talia's age is three times Jared's age. Well we were able to figure out Jared's age. It is eight. It is three times Jared's age. If you know your multiplication tables, this should maybe jump out at you. And your multiplication tables really are one of those things in mathematics that you should just really just know back and forth just because it will make the rest of your life very, very, very simple. Or you could view three times eight as literally eight three times. So it's eight plus eight plus eight. Eight plus eight is 16. Sixteen plus eight is 24. So three times eight is 24. So Peter is four, Jared is eight, and Talia is 24.
