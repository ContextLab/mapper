I've had enough requests by now for videos on investing that I thought I would make some videos on investing. And the way I'm going to go about it is, over the next few videos, I'm going to give people the vocabulary of at least how do you think about investing and what are the terms and the ratios people use and why do they make sense or why do they not make sense and when do they apply and when they not apply. And then we're going to use those tools later on and then hopefully we'll look at some particular companies. And my goal, you know, it isn't to do what they do on CNBC and, you know, tell you bye, bye, bye and sell, sell, sell because frankly, you know, that's not a thoughtful way of going about things. What I want to do is really give you the tools to come to the conclusions yourself and maybe, you know, through the videos we'll come to conclusions but I don't want to be too strong about them because if I'm wrong I don't want you to lose your 401K. So the first thing that I guess you could say bugs me a little bit is I go to these family gatherings and, you know, some uncle or aunt will come up to me and says, hey, you know, I just made a killing, I bought Citibank, it's so cheap, it's only, I don't know what it was at the time, it was only $1, it's a cheap stock as opposed to, you know, implicitly there's the assumption that a $10 stock would be expensive and I think this is very obvious to you but let me write that down. So price per share. And so when someone tells me that a $1 stock is expensive they're implicitly saying, well, that's just because it's a low number as opposed to say a $10 stock. Let's call this stock A and stock B. And I think this is very obvious to anyone, hopefully, who spent any time investing or thought about what a stock even represents but you'd be surprised. I've had, you know, family members who are doctors and engineers tell me this so I thought it's a good place to start to clarify any confusion. So my question to you is, is something that is $1 is that cheap relative to something that is $10 in the everyday world it is. If I could buy an apple for a dollar that's cheaper than an apple that costs $10 or any good really. And the twist here is that a share is just a share. It doesn't somehow represent the entire company. It's a fraction of the company. It's just a share and all companies don't have the same amount of shares. For example, if I have one company, and actually maybe that's a good point to introduce a balance sheet, let's say one company whose assets, because I want to do this throughout our discussion, whose assets are worth, let's say, $1 million. That's its assets, all its buildings and its employees and its brand. It's worth $1 million. And I'm going to, let's say it doesn't have any debt. And we'll introduce debt later because that's another variable that a lot of people don't think about when they look at stocks. They just look purely at the equity value or the market capitalization. And all of these terms will hopefully get very familiar with over the course of these videos. But let's say its assets are worth $1 million. It has no liabilities, so all of its equity, the asset value is all in equity. So this is all equity. Sometimes called stockholder's equity. And the equity is really just what the people who own the company, what is their stake? So in this case, they never borrowed any money to buy these assets. So the owners of the company own all $1 million if you believe that this is really worth $1 million. Now you could have this scenario. Let me actually draw the same scenario over again. Let me copy and paste this. So these are two equivalent companies, completely equivalent companies. But this company over here, they might have decided to have 10 shares. So if I were to draw it, let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I think that's 10 shares. Well, that's my intention. They have 10 shares. So what is the value per share? Each share, in this case, once again, if you believe that the assets are worth $1 million, they're going to be $1 million. And the equity is $1 million because there's no debt. So all of the assets are held by the equity holders. So each share would be worth $1 million divided by 10, which is equal to $100,000. Obviously, you never see $100,000 shares out there, or at least not in the great majority of examples. So this is a bit of an artificial example. More likely, a company might have a million shares, in which case, this would be a $1 stock. But anyway, this is a case where they only have 10 shares. It's $100,000. And let's say this company right now, right here, said, well, you know, $100,000. That's kind of a crazy number for a share price. It'll keep a lot of people from buying our shares. So let's just divide it into a million shares. So they have times 1 million shares. So in this situation, the company is worth what? It's worth, or the shares are worth what? They're worth 1 million divided by 1 million shares, or $1 per share. So going back to the idea, when my family member would come to me at a party, they would say, oh, look how cheap this company is compared to this company. Even more, let's say for whatever reason, because not so many people could afford this stock. Because just to get in the game, you've got to put up $100,000 to buy a share. Let's say this stock trades down, and it's trading at $50,000. And their assets are identical. So obviously, there's no two companies that are identical in this way. But let's say that they are. Let's say in both cases, the assets of this company are worth the exact same thing as the assets of that company. So here, investors are valuing this company at $1 times a million shares. They're valuing these assets at $1 million. In this case, the investor is saying, OK, I'm willing to pay $50,000 per share. And there's only 10 shares. So they're valuing the assets at $500,000. And this is, of course, the market value of the assets. And we'll talk more about market versus book value of assets. But the market value of assets is essentially, what is the market saying the assets are worth? The book value of the assets is what the accountants within the company are saying the assets are worth. And there's a whole methodology to how one would account for that. But this is the market value of the assets. And I already told you that these assets are identical. They generate the same earnings stream with the exact same risk. So in this situation, you're paying $500,000 for the same asset. That over here, you're paying $1 million for the same asset. I don't care what the actual share price is. This is what you're valuing it at. So the person who says that $1 here is cheap relative to $50,000 here, and they might even say, well, they're the same company. And I get it here for $1 a share. And I get it there for $50,000 a share. This is the cheap company. That's completely 180 degrees in the wrong direction wrong. Because you're actually paying more for this company. You're paying $1 for 1 millionth of this company while you're paying $50,000 for 1 tenth of this company. So this one is actually the better deal. So in general, when you're trying to just figure out relative price of a company, and we're going to talk a lot more about ratios and how do you know if something is inherently cheap relative to its earnings or what it could earn or its growth or anything like that. But the first cut is you can't just look at the price. The price is almost a meaningless number. It matters to some degree for trading purposes. For a lot of institutional funds, won't look at a stock that's below $5. A lot of stocks that go into the penny stocks, there's a lot of frictions in investing in penny stocks. Because obviously, if you have a $10 stock, a $10 stock could go from $10 to $10.01 and could go to $9.99. And this is what? This is only a 0.1% move. But if you have a penny stock, let's say you have a stock that's at $0.05. It can only move by a penny in one direction. And before, it was actually an eighth. So if you move only by a penny, you could only go to $0.06 or you could go to $0.04. And so in either direction, you're looking at a 20% move. While here, you're looking at a 1,000th move or 0.1% move. So that's one reason why price might matter a little bit. Here, there's huge frictions. If you were to buy and sell, there's 20% changes every time. And we'll talk about things like bid-ask spreads and liquidity and things like that in the future. But that's where the price really starts to matter. And obviously, if you have a really huge price, like $100,000, that makes it difficult for people to buy even one share. But that's the only place where price matters. Inherently, when you're talking about value, you have to take the price per share and you multiply it times the number of shares. So these stockades and stockades, these are different than the ones I drew down here. So let me draw a little dividing line right there. Let me erase some of this because this is for a different... Let me see. Let me erase that. So if in this example, let me actually erase more. Let me erase this as well. All right. So in this example, it's important to write down the number of shares you have. And you could look this up on Yahoo Finance. And we'll do this in the future with a bunch of companies. We'll just go through the motions of figuring out all of the metrics. That's a good starting point just to get a sense of what the company is all about. So let's say that this company has 10 million shares. And this company right here has 500,000 shares. So what you do is you multiply these numbers to figure out what is the market value or the market capitalization of the company. So that's a word. Market... Let me write that down. Market, sometimes called the market cap. Market capitalization. Capitalization. Market capitalization. And it's essentially just what is the market saying the equity is worth. Right? And in this case, or I went off the screen. In this case where you don't have debt, they're actually saying what is the asset worth. So if I took this, $1 per share times 10 million shares, the market is saying this company is worth $10 million. Or that the equity of this company is worth $10 million. In this case, they're saying $10 per share times 500,000 shares. They're saying it's worth $5 million. That's the market capitalization of the company. That's what the... That this is what people are saying the company is worth. And actually, I'm running out of time from there. So in the next video, we'll talk a little bit about how do people actually determine what something is worth. And that obviously can be an infinitely deep discussion. But we'll try to get our feet wet a little bit. See you soon.
