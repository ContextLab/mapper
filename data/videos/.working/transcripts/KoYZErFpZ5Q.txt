So what we have depicted here is a unit circle centered at point A, and the point B lies on the circle, and then we dropped a perpendicular from point B to point D, point D lies on the positive x-axis, and they form this triangle ABD, and they tell us at angle BAD, angle bad, it has a measure of pi over four radians. What I wanna do in this video is use our knowledge of trigonometry and use our knowledge of triangles in order to figure out several things. So the first thing we wanna figure out is what's the measure of angle, what's the radian measure, what's the radian measure, measure of angle ABD, of angle ABD. Actually, let's just do that first, and then I'll talk about the other things that we need to think about. So I assume you've paused the video and tried to do this on your own. So let's think about what ABD would be. We know two of the angles of this triangle, so if you know two of the angles of this triangle, you should be able to figure out the third. Now, what might be a little bit unfamiliar, we're used to saying that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, but now we're thinking in terms of radians. So we could say that the sum of the angles of a triangle add up to, instead of saying 180 degrees, is the same thing as pi radians. So this angle plus that angle plus that angle are going to add up to pi. So let's just say that this right over here, let's just say measure of angle ABD in radians plus pi over four, plus pi over four, plus, this is a right angle, what would that be in radians? Well, a right angle in radians, a 90 degree angle in radians, is pi over two radians. So plus pi over two, when you take the sum of them, the interior angles of this triangle, they're going to add up to pi radians, which is of course the same thing as 180 degrees. And now we can solve for the measure of angle ABD. Measure of angle ABD is equal to pi minus pi over two, minus pi over four, I just subtracted these two from both sides. So this is going to be equal to, you could put a common denominator of four, then this is four pi over four, this is minus two pi over four, and this of course is minus pi over four. So four minus two minus one is going to get us to one. So this is going to give us two pi over four. So the measure of angle ABD is actually the same as the measure of angle BAD, it is pi over four. So that angle right over there is pi over four. Now what does that help us with? So if we know that this is pi over four, and that is pi over four radians, and once again we know this is a unit circle. So we know that the length of segment AB, that this, which is a radius of the circle, or is the radius of the circle, is length one. What else do we know about this triangle? Can we figure out the lengths of segment AD and the length of segment DB? Well sure, because we have two base angles that have the same measure, that means that the corresponding sides are also going to have the same measure. That means that this side is going to be congruent to that side. I can reorient it in a way that it might make it a little bit easier to realize. If we were to flip it over, if we were to, not completely flip it over, but if we were to make it look like this, so the triangle we could make it look like, I mean we could look a little bit, a little bit more like this. Actually I want to make it look like a right angle though. So my triangle, let me make it look like, there you go. So if this is D, if this is D, this is B, this is A, this is our right angle. Now this is pi over four radians and this is also pi over four radians. When your two base angles are the same, you know you're dealing with an isosceles triangle. It's an isosceles, but because they're not all the same, you know it's not equilateral. If all of the angles were the same, this would be equilateral. But this is an isosceles non-equilateral triangle. So if your base angles are the same, then you also know that the corresponding sides are going to be the same. These two sides are the same. This is an isosceles triangle. And so how does that help us figure out the lengths of the sides? Well if you say that this side has length x, that means that this side has length x. If this side has length x, then this side has length x. And now we can use the Pythagorean theorem. We could say that x squared, this x squared, plus this x squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared, is equal to one squared. Or we could write that two x squared is equal to one, or that x squared is equal to one over two, or just taking the principal root of both sides, we get x is equal to one over the square root of two. And a lot of folks don't like having a radical in the denominator. They don't like having a rational number in the denominator. So we could rationalize the denominator by multiplying by the square root of two over the square root of two, which would be, let's see, the numerator will have the square root of two. And in the denominator, we're just going to have square root of two times square root of two is just two. So we've already been able to figure out several interesting things. We were able to figure out a measure of angle a, b, d and radians. We were able to figure out the lengths of segment a, d and the length of segment b, d. Now what I want to do is figure out what are the sine, cosine, and tangent of pi over 4 radians, given all of the work that we have done. So let's first think about what is the sine. We do this in a color, do it in orange. Given all the work we've done, what is the sine of pi over 4 radians? And I encourage you once again, pause the video, think about the unit circle definition of trig functions, and think about what this is. Well, the unit circle definition of trig functions, and this angle, this pi over 4 radians, is forming an angle with a positive x-axis. And where its terminal ray intersects the unit circle, the x and y coordinates of this point are what specify the cosine and sine. So the coordinates of this point are going to be the cosine of pi over 4 radians is the x-coordinate. And the sine of pi over 4 radians is the y-coordinate. Sine of pi over 4. So what's the y-coordinate going to be? If we want the sine of pi over 4, well, it's going to be this length right over here, which is the same thing as this length, which is the length of x, which is square root of 2 over 2. Now what is the cosine of pi over 4? And once again, I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Well, it's this x-coordinate. What's the x-coordinate? The x-coordinate is this distance right over here, which is once again going to be x, which is square root of 2 over 2. Now what is the tangent of pi over 4 going to be? Well, the tangent of pi over 4 is just sine of pi over 4 over cosine of pi over 4. Now both of these are this exact same thing. They're both square root of 2 over 2. So you're going to have square root of 2 over 2 divided by square root of 2 over 2. Well, that's just going to give you 1. And that also makes sense, because remember, the tangent of this angle is the slope of this line. And we see the slope. For every x we move in the horizontal direction, we move x up. So our change in y over change in x is essentially x over x, which is equal to 1.
