A bookstore receives 219 new books and then gets six more as a last minute delivery. The manager organizes all of the books evenly into three or onto three shelves. How many books are in each shelf? Pause this video and see if you can do this before we do this together. All right, so what we wanna do is figure out the total number of books and then divide them evenly or divide them by three. And so the total number of books is going to be 219, I'm gonna try to keep the colors the same, 219 books and then they get six more. So this is the total number of books. So we're going to want to calculate that first. And then we wanna divide that into three, evenly into three shelves. So we could just divide that by three. Divide by three. So what's 219 plus six? So what we could do is, well, we might be able to do that in our head. What's 19 plus six? Well, 19 plus one is 20 and then you have five left. So it's going to be 25. So 219 plus six is 225. So this is 225. Just to make that clear, let me do this here. 219 plus six, nine plus six is 15. My brain is doing the wrong thing. Regroup that one. And then we just have tens here. So we have one 10 plus another 10 is two tens. And then we have the two hundreds. But you might've just said, okay, 19 plus six is going to be 25. So 219 plus six is 225. And then we wanna divide that by three. So we could do a little bit of long division now. So if we say, how many times does three go into 225? Well, we could see three doesn't go into two, but it does go into 22 seven times. Seven times three is 21. We can subtract. 22 minus 21 is one. Bring down this five, we get a 15. Three goes into 15 exactly five times. Five times three is 15. And then we have no remainder. So 25 divided by three is 75. So we have exactly 75 books on each shelf and we're done.
