Hi, Sal Khan here from Khan Academy. And I'm just here to remind everyone that Khan Academy is a not-for-profit organization with the mission of providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. And we can only do that work through philanthropic donations from folks like yourself. And if you need any extra motivation, I will remind you that there's actually a good body of scientific research that one of the top ways to become a happier person, which we all wanna do, is to give to others. And when you give to Khan Academy, the social return on investment is really one of the highest impact philanthropy things that you can do. So when you give those dollars, not only will it help tens of millions of folks around the world, but will also make you a happier person as we go to the back half to 2020 and into 2021. To make it even better, every dollar you give will be matched, dollar for dollar, by a matching gift that we have received from a very generous philanthropist. So as we make our way to the end of 2020, which has been a tough year, and more folks are dependent on Khan Academy and being able to keep learning than ever before, I hope you seriously consider thinking about how powerful a donation to Khan Academy can be and how happy that's going to make you.
