Hi, this is Sal Khan of the Khan Academy and I just wanted to thank everyone out there for another great year. We're now reaching over 10 million students per month and many of you all have noticed amazing partnerships and the content that we've been able to work together to put out there. But one thing I do like to remind people at this time of year is that we are a 501c3 not for profit organization and the only reason why we can exist, why we can continue to put out this content is with the help of supporters like yourself. So I'll just throw that out there. If you're in a position, whether it's $5, $10 or a lot more than that, every penny is very much appreciated by us at Khan Academy so that we can continue to try to deliver a free world class education to the world.
