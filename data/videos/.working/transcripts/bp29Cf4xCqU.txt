We are told that Jade is making pancakes using flour, eggs, and milk. This table gives the cost per kilogram of each ingredient and the amount in kilograms that Jade uses. All right, the total amount Jade spends on ingredients is $6. Write an equation that relates A, B, C, and D. Pause this video and see if you can have a go at this. All right, now let's go through this together. So I like to do these in real time so that you can see my thought process. So I'm here with you right now. So let's see, the total Jade spends, and this is going to be on flour, eggs, and milk, is going to be $6. So one way to think about it is the, and I'll do this in different colors, the flour dollars plus the eggs, eggs dollars, or the amount that Jade's gonna spend on eggs, plus the amount that Jade spends on milk, I'll call that the milk dollars, is going to be equal to the total amount, is going to be equal to $6. And so what's the total amount that Jade is going to spend on flour? Well, we can just look right over here. $0.9 per kilogram times eight kilograms. So Jade is going to spend $0.9 a dollars. I'm just going to multiply these two things to figure out how much Jade spends on flour. And so this is going to be equal to, and I'll lose the dollar symbol just so we can focus on the numbers and the variables, 0.9 a, 0.9 a, and this is of course, is going to be in dollars, which is important. I'm gonna add dollars plus dollars plus dollars to get dollars. Now what about eggs? Well, the same notion, 0.2 kilograms times B dollars per kilogram. If I take the product of these two, I'm gonna get 0.2 B dollars, or I could just think of it as 0.2 B if I don't write the dollar symbol. And then last but not least, on milk, let me look at the product of these two things, of this and of this. So D kilograms at $C per kilogram, that's just going to be C D dollars. So plus C D, and all of that is going to be equal to $6. And we're done. We wrote an equation that relates A, B, C, and D.
