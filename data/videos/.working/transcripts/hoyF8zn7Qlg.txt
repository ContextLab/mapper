I'm here with famous author Jeffrey Moore. What are we going to do now? Well, continuing our exercise in the writing curriculum, we're going to focus in on the step of invention, which is when a writer figures out what is it I have to say and how am I going to get it said. And so what do we see this big block of text for? Well, so one of the things you do in a college a lot is you read other people's writings and then you're expected to develop your own point of view about them. So not just read and memorize and regurgitate, but read, criticize and then present your own point of view. So I'm going to show you how we actually would do that in a typical writing assignment in any, frankly, any college class. I've picked a text about teaching because it's something that you and I both care about and it'd be like a class we might be taking in education. So I think what we'd like to do here is have you read it out loud and then I'm going to start to ask you as you're going along to note your reactions and we'll note them down. And that's the first step in the invention process that we call read and react. Okay. So did I start? Yeah, please. All right. So this is I guess the title is excerpts from high school teacher Gerald Conti's resignation. Where did you find this? Yeah. So this was on the internet a couple of weeks ago. This is where we're in April of 2013 here. And basically it's a wonderful high school teacher who fundamentally had just had enough. And in resigning, he sort of laid out what his feelings were and they resonated got a lot of it got a lot of circulation on the internet. Okay. So let's read this. My profession is being demeaned by a pervasive atmosphere of distrust, dictating that teachers cannot be permitted to develop and administer their own quizzes and tests now titled as generic assessments or grade their own students examinations. The development of plans, choice of lessons and the materials to be employed are increasingly expected to be common to all teachers in a given subject. This approach not only strangles creativity, it smothers the development of critical thinking in our students and assumes a one size fits all mentality more appropriate to the assembly line than to the classroom. We have become increasingly evaluation and not knowledge driven process has become our most important product to twist a phrase from corporate America, which seems doubly appropriate to this case. Okay, let's stop there. So as you were reading that, so what are some of the top of mind reactions you had? I empathize with where he's coming from. I mean, I could imagine being in his position and I don't know exactly what he's reacting to. He's reacting very strongly to something. It sounds like someone's telling him what to do, essentially micromanaging him. Yeah. Okay. So we just, if I'd make some notes somewhere around here, I'd say something about micromanagement. I'd say something about the strength maybe of the reaction. So what's going on there? As you were looking at that, what in your own experience either corroborates that or might cause you to question that? You know, I've actually made video content with some folks that were very particular about what I should cover and what I don't cover. And I think for me, a lot of the joy of making videos is my own kind of personal contribution to it. And I personally do react very strongly when someone kind of tells me what... So I would circle strangles creativity because you're clearly empathizing with it. I think it's right there. Where it's not only strangles creativity, it smothers the development of critical thinking in our students. Now, interesting question. Do you think that by strangling your creativity, I'm doing a disservice to your students? Possibly. It essentially depends what this one size fits all curriculum that's being pushed on to these teachers is doing. But I could imagine that... I mean, he's essentially complaining about two things. One, the state or the district or whoever micromanaging what he's doing. But he's also complaining about the actual micromanagement itself, that it's actually probably bad quality. It's something that he would fundamentally... He's not thinking it's a great curriculum that's being forced on him. Okay. So there's two interesting points there. One then is the system and the governance. Right. Right. And then this other one is the actual execution of that governance by people of low... potentially or behavior of low quality. What about this idea about becoming increasingly evaluation and not knowledge driven? That one, I agree. I think there too, he's reacting more against bad assessments, much less than the general idea of assessments. In fact, I think if we were to have a conversation with him, my guess is that he wouldn't be anti-assessments of any kind. It's just he's anti-bad assessments that are trying to just capture a very superficial understanding. One size fits. I'll teach to the test, I hear a lot. Right. And teach to a superficial test. But just to develop, to talk about your point of view a little bit, you actually make quite an important point of including testing in the overall formation of your curriculum. So why do you do that? So there is an evaluation part in there. How is it different from the evaluation he's rebelling against? I mean, even he also clearly would like to write his own tests and examinations. I mean, he complains that he's not being allowed to. Oh, good point. So I don't think he's anti-assessment. I mean, you have to somehow figure out whether the students are kind of internalizing what's going on in the classroom. I think I'd probably agree with him that it's really what the assessment is about. I mean, I have seen a lot of these kind of standardized assessments that get put out, especially at the state level, that really are just measuring things at a very superficial level versus deep understanding. Okay. I think that's great. And we might capture that, something about superficial. Now, what we would be doing, if Sal was alone, he'd be writing notes on the page around it. I'm kind of distracting him a bit with conversation, but he'd be sort of capturing his ideas, where he agrees, maybe where he has a slight departure. Let's try the next paragraph. STEM rules the day. STEM rules the day and data-driven education. We should probably tell people what STEM is. STEM science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Rules the day and data-driven education seeks only conformity, standardization, testing, and a zombie-like adherence to the shallow and generic common core, along with a lockstep of oversimplified so-called essential learnings. Creativity, academic freedom, teacher autonomy, experimentation, and innovation are being stifled in a misguided effort to fix what is not broken in our system of public education, and particularly not at our school. Not at our school. I'm going to double-underline that. Okay. So how did you react to this paragraph? Here I'm feeling a little bit more mixed. I mean, I agree with him. STEM, to a large degree, does rule the day. There's a huge focus on mathematics and science, and a lot, because that's where at least the perception is a lot of kind of the future jobs are and where we're falling short to a large degree. And arguably, most of your first 1,000 videos were in STEM. Yes. That's what I'm known for. But I don't think that's the most important thing, obviously. We're doing other things right now. This video is a non-STEM video. Data-driven education seeks only conformity. Now, I know where he's coming from, and I understand his point of view. I don't think he's saying, I mean, if I'm trying to understand him, I don't think he's saying data-driven is bad. I think he's, all of this when he's complaining about testing and curriculum and data-driven, he's complaining about the variation of that that's being imposed on him. That a superficial data is kind of overpowering other things, which I would also agree with. Although here, it's kind of data-driven is being thrown into one big bag. Yes. The opposite of data-driven is no data-driven, which is also not necessarily a good thing. I would argue there's some name calling going on in this paragraph, which name calling is always a bit zombie-like. Right. Oh, yeah. This is definitely some type of a... Here's the shallow and generic common core. And this is actually interesting. This is another area where even at Khan Academy, we're looking at the various standards, including the common core. Well, we could go. I could talk for hours about these things. Sure. And we could. But the point about it is you're developing a point of view where while you empathize with his emotional reaction and you can see where it came from, your point of view, this is not a paragraph I think you would have written. No, that's not a reference. What would you have said about STEM instead? It's incredibly important that regardless of whether you go into a STEM field or not, it gives you analytical thinking, logical skills. There actually is a creative component to STEM. I mean, the E in STEM, engineering. When you write a paper, you're kind of engineering. I mean, engineering is fundamentally a creative pursuit, like writing or painting or anything else. And so, I think STEM shouldn't be just thrown. I think sometimes those in STEM sometimes belittle the humanities as saying, oh, it's just fufu touchy feely stuff. That's not true. It teaches you critical thinking. It makes you creative, et cetera, et cetera. And those sometimes in the humanities belittled STEM as like, oh, it's robotic. It's one size fits all. It's the right answer versus the wrong answer. There's no creativity. And that's completely false. In fact, I'd argue that to be great, to be great in either, it's actually you're exercising the same muscles. Great critical thinking, great core skills, but a lot of creativity. That's what differentiates you in STEM or in the humanities. I think that's okay. So that was very cool. By the way, this might be a place for us to kind of pull this into a close. We may not need to go after the third paragraph. So what I was doing with Sal was essentially we started with somebody else's letter. And the first thing we tried to do was we tried to capture the author's argument. You saw Sal empathizing with him, kind of even going the extra mile to give him the benefit of the doubt. You know, this is what he's saying, but that at some point he found his point of departure from that. And it ended up him saying a pretty interesting thing about the interaction between the humanities and the STEM curricula, a little bit of right brain, left brain, and how the two interact with each other going forward. That was his point of view. That was not anywhere in this letter. And the idea behind invention when read and react is you start with someone else's text. You give yourself over to the text. You let the other person's argument hold its sway so that you can understand it. But then at some point you diverge from that argument, you depart from it, and you create your own point of view. And in academic writing, that's how academics goes forward. You inherit the tradition with what's been written before you. You read it, you react to it, and then you contribute to it going forward. And that's what the read and react invention process is for.
