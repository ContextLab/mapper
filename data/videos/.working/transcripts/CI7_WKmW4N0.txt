Welcome to statistics at the Khan Academy. And the purpose of this video is to give you an overview of what's included in the statistics section here in the Khan Academy, and really so that you can navigate it according to what your needs are. So we start off with a bunch of exercises that are really around reading, interpreting, and constructing different types of charts and graphs. So anything from reading tables, we also have one on creating bar charts, which is pretty fun, where we're given some data and you have to construct the appropriate bar charts, reading line charts. But if you already feel fairly comfortable with all of this and you don't need much practice in it, I do recommend going immediately to the statistics intro, the mean, median, and mode, to kind of go into the meat of what would typically be covered in an introductory statistics course. And as you feel, and as you kind of get the concepts that are covered in the videos, we have more and more exercises that start to go through those concepts. So this is the exercise on mean, median, and mode, exploring mean, median, and mode, on and on. We talk a little bit about box and whisker plots. We start going into variance, sample variance. And we go all the way pretty deep into kind of a introductory inferential statistics. And you see here, especially on some of the earlier topics, we have a good bit of exercises that are sprinkled in between the videos. So anyway, hopefully that serves your needs. If you want to get a little practice interpreting data, you can start on some of these initial exercises. If you already feel that you know that reasonably well, I recommend you go straight to statistics intro, the mean, median, and mode.
