Choose the right number of each place value to make 8,129. And we could say this is 123,000. So we could say it is 1 10th, 2 hundredths, and 3 thousandths. So let's just go place by place. So first we have eight. This eight right here is in the thousands place. It represents 8,000. So we're going to have 8,000. So let's select 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 thousands. Then we have 100. So we literally just have only 100 right over there. Then we have 2 tens. This 20 is 2 tens. We're going to need 2 tens. Then this 9. Well, that's just 9 ones. So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And now we're going into the tenths place. This is only 1 tenth. So 1 tenth right like that. This is 2 hundredths. So we're going to put 2 hundredths there. And then finally, 3 thousandths. 1, 2, 3 thousandths. And we check our answer. And we got it right.
