What we're gonna do in this video is think about what multiplying fractions really mean. And let's start with two times 1 3rd. What do you think this is going to be equal to? Well, there's a couple of ways that we could represent this. We could take a hole here. So that is a hole. And let's split it in 2 3rds. So three equal sections. My drawing isn't perfect, but let's say assume that it is perfect. Well, 1 3rd of that hole, that would be one of the three equal sections. So if I say two times that, that would be two of these. So I could draw another hole there and split it into three equal sections and then just shade in a third or one of those three equal sections. So I have one and two of these thirds. So you could literally say I have two thirds. So you could say I have two thirds now. Another way that might be useful to think about it is, imagine if we just start with a hole over here, ignore this on the left-hand side for a second. So if we just had a hole over here and I split it into thirds. So we're going to start with 1 3rd. That's 1 3rd right there, but we're saying two times 1 3rd. So we're gonna have two of these. So that's one of them. That would be one times 1 3rd. And then two times 1 3rd would be one more of those. So in total, how much do we have? Well, I filled in two of the three equal squares here, the two equal sections. So that is 2 3rds. Let's do another example and mix it up a little bit more. Let's say I were to ask you what blank times, well blank times 1 5th is equal to 3 5ths. What would be blank in your mind? Well, the way that my brain likes to imagine this is let's split a hole in 2 5ths. So one, two, three, four, five. So these are, this is 5 5ths here, although none of them have been filled in. And if I wanted to represent 3 5ths, I could fill in three of them. So 3 5ths would be one, two, and three. So how many times did I have to multiply 1 5th by? That's a fifth. So that's one times 1 5th, two times 1 5th, and three times 1 5th. Well, I had to multiply it by three. So three times 1 5th is literally 3 5ths, or 3 1 5ths, depending on how you wanna think about it. Let's do one last example. Let's say someone were to walk up to you on the street and say, hey you, what's four? Well, they'd say, hey you, four times blank is equal to 4 3rds. What is blank going to be? Well, I'll give you a little bit of a hint. It might involve thirds, because at the end we get four of these thirds. So one way to think about it is, I could take some holes and divide them into thirds. Actually, I'll do two holes right over here and I'll divide them into thirds. Now four thirds would be filling in four of these thirds. So one, two, three, and four. So you can see another way of thinking about this. That's one hole and another third, or we can think of it as four thirds. But what just happened here? I just had four times what? Well, I had four times this square right here, because that's one, two, three, and four. I multiplied four times a third. So four times a third is four thirds.
