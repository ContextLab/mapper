Hello teachers, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the not-for-profit Khan Academy with the goal of helping you Accelerate outcomes in your classroom and I have an exciting announcement What we are launching is a new mastery framework on Khan Academy We have some of the most significant features ever around personalization and mastery learning where your students can get as much practice as they need as much feedback as they need and the most Important part of a mastery learning system is the teacher is the human being in the classroom So it's explicitly designed to increase human interactions to give you the teacher insights on which students might need help Which students might need a little bit of motivation? We've designed dashboards so that teachers can identify gaps and misconceptions in their students in real time We've significantly added to the amount of content not just in math where we've always had tens of thousands of exercises from kindergarten through calculus and statistics but also in high school and college level Sciences and the humanities and most importantly it's flexible to meet your needs. This can be done in the classroom It could be used as part of in-class practice It could be part of review or it can be done as part of homework And we are seeing the classrooms that use Khan Academy for the classroom at least 30 minutes per week are seeing incredible gains in their student outcomes I look at my reports a lot I use data a lot to drive my instruction and to drive what I need to reteach They tell me exactly where that student is it tells me how many attempts have they have done it specifically So there's real data telling me hey this student is getting it wrong They're not doing 30 problems and then realizing Oh, I don't know what I'm doing and I just made some really bad habits for myself So thank you teachers all of us at Khan Academy are incredibly inspired by the work that you do day in and day out Anything we can do to make your lives easier or to help accelerate the learning for your students. We are excited to do with you
