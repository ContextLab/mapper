Hi, I'm Michelle, a professional learning specialist here at Khan Academy and a former classroom teacher just like you. Meet Khanmigo, your AI-driven companion who's revolutionizing teaching for a more engaging and efficient experience. Khanmigo has many exciting features that support teachers, and this video will showcase ways that you can use Khanmigo to create core-specific science content to enhance the learning experience for all of your students. Throughout this video, we'll explore ways Khanmigo can assist you with creating unique and engaging lesson plans and student-centered activities that get students excited about science while saving you time. Ready to see the teaching assistant you've always wanted? Let's take a look. This is Khanmigo's dashboard. It's filled with a plethora of unique and helpful features designed to enhance your teaching experience and save you time. Let's start with the Lesson Hook feature. Igniting a passion for science in students can be challenging, but it's profoundly impactful and a definite game changer when successful. With Khanmigo's assistance, I can craft captivating lesson openers that ignite student curiosity in science. My next unit is going to be about erosion and weathering, so I'm going to go ahead and type that here. I am a 6th grade teacher, and then I'm going to just ask Khanmigo to write some lesson hooks for me. And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo comes up with three fantastic lesson hooks that I can use with my students. If for some reason I don't like one of them, no worries at all. All I have to do is highlight it and ask Khanmigo for assistance. With Khanmigo, I can chat about it, I can ask Khanmigo to make changes to it, or I just don't like it, so I can ask Khanmigo to try something different and Khanmigo will oblige. These ideas are great. My students are going to be super excited about starting our new unit on erosion and weathering. Thanks, Khanmigo. Now that I've piqued my students' interest in this topic, it's time to plan my lesson. Khanmigo's lesson plan feature will assist me with creating a detailed lesson plan tailored to my curriculum and my students' needs. When I select the lesson plan button, Khanmigo prompts me to describe the topic I'm planning to teach. Once Khanmigo has that information, a list of available topics from one of the amazing Khan Academy courses populates for me to select from. If my topic isn't available on Khan Academy, no worries. Khanmigo lets me select my own content. Hmm, here's a video that I'm interested in having my students watch. I'm going to select it. As soon as I make my choice, Khanmigo springs into action to create a structured and detailed lesson plan tailored to my curriculum and student needs. Once the lesson plan is created, I'm able to view the objectives, the materials needed, activities, assessments, and so, so, so much more, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience for my students. Also, the lesson plans are fully customizable. You can easily modify any part of the lesson plan to better suit your needs and preferences. You can simply click on the part of a lesson you want to change and ask Khanmigo for help, or you can just edit it directly. Whether it's the warm-up, the objectives, the activity, the assessments, you have full control over the content. Once you are completely satisfied with your lesson, you have the ability to print your lesson directly, or you can export it to Microsoft Word, a PDF, or save it to your Google Drive. This saved me so much time. Thank you so much, Khanmigo. As an educator, I aim to bridge class from learning with real-life scenarios to enhance my students' engagement with the topic. Khanmigo's real-world context generator will do just that for me in a matter of seconds, boosting my students' interest and investment in the topic. All I have to do is let Khanmigo know my grade level and the topic we're currently working on, the water cycle. And Khanmigo instantly is going to give me some ideas. These ideas are great! I know that sometime in their lives, my students have either boiled water themselves or have seen someone boil water. They all know what plants are, and they've all experienced a rainy day. These ideas are fantastic. Thanks, Khanmigo! Another cool feature is the Leveler, which lets me customize the complexity of text to align with my students' reading levels, allowing me to personalize instruction and effectively address each student's needs. Once I open the Leveler, I just have to let Khanmigo know the title of the text. Ionic compound structure. This is for my 11th grade chemistry class. And then I just copy and paste the original text into the box and let Khanmigo know the level that I'd like this text rewritten for. This is for one of my students who's currently reading on a 7th grade level. And as soon as I hit the button, Khanmigo will revise the text for me at a 7th grade reading level. As you can see, integrating Khanmigo into your classroom routine empowers you to tailor Khanmigo's ideas and suggestions to your science curriculum while factoring in student needs, learning objectives, and creative resources. Khanmigo's insights will not only enrich the learning experience for all of your students, but it will also free up your time, enabling you to concentrate on what truly matters—your students.
