The graph of y is equal to the absolute value of x is reflected across the x-axis and then compressed vertically by a factor of 8 thirds. What is the equation of the new graph? Alright, so let's think about this step by step. So if I start, and I'm just gonna draw some quick hand-drawn sketches here. So that's my x-axis, that is my y-axis. And if we're talking about the graph of y is equal to the absolute value of x, that looks like this in the first quadrant, it looks like y equals x, and in the second quadrant, it looks like y equals negative x, because the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite. So let me make it look a little bit more symmetric than that. So it looks something, something like that. That's what the graph of y is equal to the absolute value of x looks like. Now they're asking us to do what amounts to two different transformations. The first one is they want to reflect it, they want to reflect across the x-axis. So they want us to flip it across the x-axis like this, so instead it looks like this. So that graph, that equation that describes this graph, well this is going to be the opposite. Whatever y you were getting on this orange graph, you're gonna get the negative of that. So you're gonna get y is equal to the negative of the absolute value of x. And if this doesn't make intuitive sense to you, try it out. In the orange graph, when x is equal to, let's say two, well the absolute value of two is two. The absolute value of negative two is two. But now we want to take the absolute value, but then take the negative of it. This thing stays non-positive the entire time. So the absolute value of two is two, but we want the opposite of that. We want negative two. Absolute value of negative two is two, but we want the opposite of that. But they didn't ask us to just reflect across the x-axis. They then want us to compress vertically by a factor of eight-thirds. So let's think about this a little bit. Compress vertically by a factor of eight-thirds. So if they said stretch vertically by a factor of eight-thirds, then I would just multiply this by eight-thirds. And sometimes it's helpful to think of this as in terms of a mixed number. Eight-thirds is the same thing as two and two-thirds. So if you were to stretch by two and two-thirds, you would get taller. You would look something, you would, it would get something like this. But if you are compressing, then it's gonna look something like this. If you're compressing vertically, you can think about it as being stretched horizontally. So if you're compressing by a factor, you should multiply by the reciprocal of that factor. Think about it. If you were compressing by three, you would multiply by one-third. So if you were compressing vertically by eight-thirds, well, that means whatever y you would have gotten, you multiply that times the reciprocal of eight-thirds. Or another way you could think about it, you could divide that by eight-thirds. So if we wanna get, if we wanna get this thing right over here, this is going to be y is equal to the negative absolute value of x. And since we're compressing by eight-thirds, we would divide that by eight-thirds. Or another way to think about it, dividing by eight-thirds is the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. So negative three-eighths times the absolute value of x. And when we look at our choices, we see that it is that choice right over there. And I really wanna stress this point because I think it can get a little bit confusing. The reason why I multiplied that by the reciprocal, it was saying compressing vertically. If we said stretching vertically, we would just multiply by eight-thirds. But since we're compressing, we would divide by eight-thirds or multiply by its reciprocal.
