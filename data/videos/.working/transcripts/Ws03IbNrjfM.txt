So they're asking us to find the least common multiple of these two different polynomials. So the first one is three z to the third minus six z squared minus nine z. And the second one is seven z to the fourth plus 21 z to the third plus 14 z squared. Now if you're saying, well what is the least, you're familiar with least common multiple of two numbers, one way to think about them is if I were to find, say, the least common multiple between, I don't know, four and six, you literally could look at all the multiples and see which ones are, which one is least. So you go four, eight, 12, 16, so on and so forth. You could do the same thing for six. You could go six, 12, 18, 24, so on and so forth. And you immediately see that they do have, they'll actually have multiple common multiples, but the least of the common multiples that you immediately see is going to be 12. Now another way to think about it is, is to actually factor these numbers out. We could view four, you could view four as being two times two if you look at its prime factorization and six is two times three. So you could say that the least common multiple, the LCM of four and six is going to be, or it's going to be equal to, well it's going to have to have the factors of both of them. So it's going to have to have two fours, two times two, and it's going to have to have a two and a three. Well we already have a two, in fact we have two of them, so in order to be divisible by three, in order to be divisible by six, we have to have three as one of the factors. And so when you look at it that way, you say hey look, we have to contain all of the factors of each of them. We have to have at least two twos, and we have to have at least one three, because the two twos take care of this one two right over there, and you see that this is also going to be equal to 12. Now when we think about it for polynomials, we're going to think about it a little bit more. It's essentially the same idea, but we're going to think about it a little bit more with the second lens, where we're going to think about the factors and say well the least common multiple needs to contain the factors of both, but it shouldn't contain more than that. You can always find a multiple of two polynomials by just multiplying them, but we don't want to find just any multiple, we want to find the least common multiple. So let's factor each of them. So this first one, three z to the third minus six z squared minus nine z. Let's see immediately, let's see all of these terms are divisible by three z, so let's factor out a three z. So it's three z times z squared, if you factor out a three z out of that. See it's going to be minus two z, if you factor out a three z out of that, and then minus three. And notice if you were to distribute this three z back, you would get exactly what we have up here. And so let's see, can we factor this further? Can we think of two numbers that if you multiply them, we get negative three, and if we add them, we get negative two, and one's going to be positive, one's going to be negative, since their product is negative. So let's see, it sounds like negative three and positive one. So we could rewrite this as three z times z plus one times z minus three. I think I've factored this first polynomial as about as much as I can. One times negative three is negative three. One z minus three z is negative two z, so that looks good. So now let's factor this other character over here, this fourth degree polynomial. So every one of those terms look like they're divisible by seven z squared, so I could write this as seven z squared times z squared, when you factor out a seven z squared here, you're just left with z squared. And then plus, 21 divided by seven is three, z to the third divided by z squared is z. And then plus 14 divided by seven is two, z squared divided by z squared is one, so it's just gonna be a two there. And so this is gonna be the same thing as seven z squared, and this can be factored into, let's see, two times one is two, two plus one is three. So z plus one times z plus two. Now let's think about the least common multiple. We've factored each of these just the way that we, when we did the prime factorization for regular numbers, now we have factored this down to as simple expressions as we will find useful. And so the least common multiple of these two things has to contain each of these factors. So the least common multiple's gotta contain a three z. It's gotta contain, and let me expand it out a little bit. It's gotta contain a three, it's gotta contain a z. It's gotta contain a z plus one, z plus one. It's, I don't have to write the little dot there since I'm, it's gotta contain a z plus one. It's gotta contain a z minus three. Let's see, it's gotta contain a seven. We do not have a seven here yet, so we have to include, we have to include a seven. So I'll put the seven out front with the numbers. It's gotta include a seven. It's gotta include a z squared. Well we only have a z right now, so let's throw in another z. So I could throw in another, I could write, I could put a z out front or I could just make this a squared. It still contains that z, but now we contain another z or multiplying by another z to have z squared. See we already have a z plus one in here. We need a z plus two as well, z plus two as well. And there you have it. This is the least common multiple. If I were to write it all out in a neutral color, it's going to be 21 z squared times z plus one times z minus three times z plus two. I say two and I write six, z plus two. And we are all done. And I really want you to appreciate, this is the exact same thing we're doing when we're doing, or a very similar thing than what we're doing when we're finding least common multiples of regular numbers. We're looking at their factors and in the case of numbers, prime factors, and then we say okay, the least common multiple has to contain, each of, has to be a superset, has to contain all of these, but we don't wanna contain, you know I could multiply this times 100. It's still gonna be a common multiple but it's no longer the least common multiple. Likewise, 12 is the least common multiple of four and six. If I just wanted a common multiple, I could multiply that times 100. 1200 would also be a multiple of four and six, but it wouldn't be the least common multiple. So we don't wanna, we don't wanna do that. Hopefully you found that interesting.
