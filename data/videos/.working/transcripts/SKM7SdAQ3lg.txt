Khan Academy Financial Literacy Theater presents Insurance and You Let's say you open a bakery Oh, what a cute bakery You open it, it's successful Boy do people love your sticky toffee cookies And then it's struck by lightning and burns down Oops Now you're out of luck And you don't have the money to rebuild the business Because you invested everything in start-up costs But let's run that back again This time with business insurance That's what I'm talking about That's what I'm talking about Insurance is in so many words an oven mitt It allows you to handle dangerously hot things Without burning your hands, financially speaking When you take out an insurance policy You pay an amount of money called a premium each year In exchange you get a certain amount of protection Against bad outcomes That protection is called coverage So now you have insurance Your bakery gets struck by lightning and burns down But this time the insurance company says Wow, that was unlikely Here's money to help you rebuild and reopen But you're asking where did the insurance company get that money Well, all things being equal It's not particularly common to lose your business to a lightning strike As an insurance policy holder You're in an insurance pool full of other insurance policy holders Who are also paying those same premiums to the company Effectively everyone is paying into a bucket of money That gets paid out when disaster strikes Each insurance policy is different And at the insurance company An underwriter determines how risky you are to insure Essentially, how likely is it that something will happen to you Well, that depends Is your bakery teetering on the edge of an active volcano? That's an expensive premium In fact, it's probably an uninsurable risk But for the sake of this video, let's pretend it's just a stiff premium Or is your bakery in the middle of a soybean field? Less expensive to insure Although it'd probably be a better business decision to put it in a town Business insurance is just one of the many varieties of insurance Available for sale in these United States There's also health insurance, dental insurance, car insurance, life insurance, home insurance So many ways to make sure you don't get burned Health insurance, homeowners insurance, and car insurance policies Have a feature called a deductible Which is the amount of money you must pay out of your own pocket Before the insurance coverage kicks in This is on top of your monthly premium So let's say I have a health insurance policy with a $500 deductible And someone hits me in the nose with a baseball bat Ahh! Now, let's say I get to the hospital And I need to get my nose splinted so I can heal back to normal Okay, wow So, let's say it costs $1000 to fix my beautiful face With a $500 deductible, I'm on the hook for the first $500 of that thousand I have to put up that money before the company will pay the rest of the bill That's my deductible But there's also the copay Which is the money I have to put up each time for prescriptions or regular visits Maybe it's $20, right? Every time you go get a prescription or visit the doctor You have to cough up $20 Then there's car insurance Not unlike health insurance, except it's for a car You pay a premium, you have a deductible, but it comes in two flavors Liability and collision or comprehensive insurance Liability insurance is required in all but two US states This kind of insurance covers the cost if you caused an accident And hurt someone or damage someone's property Like if you back into your neighbor's garage door Or the car inside their garage Or your neighbor Basically, if it's your fault, it helps pay for the mess But here's the catch It only covers their stuff, not yours So if you smash your own bumper into a wall Or total your own car in a crash Liability insurance just shrugs and says That sounds like a you problem While your own car covered too, you'll need extra insurance for that And since liability insurance won't help you if your car gets crunched There are optional add-ons you can get Like collision and or comprehensive coverage These kick in for stuff like someone else crashing into you Your car getting stolen, random acts of nature Or, for example, a moose It covers incidents that you can walk away from But what if you, um, can't walk away from it? That's right, I'm talking about life insurance The scariest kind It's for the most difficult situation When you die If you have life insurance, the person or people you've named as your beneficiaries Usually family members, get a payout of money Why does that matter? Because when you're gone Your paycheck is gone Your health insurance is gone But your loved ones still need to pay rent Buy groceries Go to the doctor Life insurance can't replace you You're irreplaceable But it can help replace the income that you would have brought in if you were still alive The cost depends on things like your age, your health, and how much coverage you want Some policies cover you for a specific amount of time, like 25 years And if you're still kicking when it expires, that's it No payout Maybe the insurance company sends you a thank you card for not costing them any money Other kinds of life insurance are permanent And guarantee a payout no matter when you go Here's a question we get a lot Can you take out a policy on someone you don't like and hope that they die Or arrange things so that they pass away sooner than expected? No! No! And furthermore, don't! But also, no, you just can't do that You have to have an insurable interest in order to buy a life insurance policy You have to be family, or you have to be in business with them Or something that makes you depend on that person being alive And whoever's life you're trying to insure has to sign off on it Anyway, don't have someone murdered for the insurance money It's great stuff for thriller movies, but it's no way to make a living That's right, hot take Here at Khan Academy, we think murder is bad, don't do it So, insurance is famous for not being the most interesting topic in the world But in all the scenarios we talked about, being uninsured in this society would leave you out in the cold With no bakery, no car, and a nose that's still broken Stay safe out there And watch out for moose
