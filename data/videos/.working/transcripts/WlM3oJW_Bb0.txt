Sal Khan here from Khan Academy. Now, some of y'all are, hopefully many of y'all are familiar with Khan Academy. We're a not-for-profit with the mission of providing a free world-class education for anyone anywhere. But one area that people are probably less familiar with, but it might be one of the coolest parts of what we do, is Khan Academy Kids. Khan Academy Kids is an app that covers all subject areas from preschool through second grade. We have efficacy studies that show in as little as 10 weeks, students are showing the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. And we know how important it is, especially as we're going into second or third grade, for students to get fluency in skills like reading, skills like numeracy. A big part that we're focused on is making sure that it can be used to support you in a school district setting. As a principal, as a district leader, you can get reports on what is happening. Feel confident that your students are making progress towards their standards. And when we work with districts, we are trying to make it as affordable and as accessible as possible. The cost, which we've tried to keep as low as possible, is $5 per student per year. I hope you take a serious look. Anyone who plays with Khan Academy Kids will see that it is a very joyful app, very interactive, somewhat magical, and it works.
