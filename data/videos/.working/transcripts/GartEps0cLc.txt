So we have a situation here where someone is attempting to multiply 586 times 43. And what we wanna do together is figure out if they did this correctly or whether they made a mistake and if they made a mistake, what step did they make a mistake on? And actually, why don't you pause this video and have a go at this on your own before we work through this together. All right, now let's work through this together. So let's start at the beginning here. We have three times six is 18. So you put the eight here, regroup the one. That all looks good right now. Then you have three times eight is 24. Plus that one that we just regrouped is 25. Put the five here, regroup the two, all looking good so far. Three times five is 15. Plus two is 17. Wrote the 17 here. So step one, all looks good to me. Now let's look at, we're now now going to, now let's move on to the four, which is really a 40. So we're gonna put a zero right over here. And then we're gonna say four times six is 24. Put the four here, regroup the two. Four times eight is 32. Plus two is 34. Put the four, regroup the three. Four times five is 20. Plus the three is 23. So it looks like a mistake was made in step two. And of course step three is gonna break down because they forgot to put the three right over there. So definitely a mistake and the mistake is in step two.
