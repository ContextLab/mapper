Well, I just wanted to introduce everyone to Angela Arence, just as a little bit of background on how all of this happened. Y'all know I was just in England two weeks ago, and as part of that, you came to the talk at the London School of Economics, and then the next day we met at Heathrow Airport. I had my $6 Old Navy shirt feeling very insecure the entire time. Both Esther and I were there, and you inspired us. When you said you were going to be in this area, we were like, well, we would love you to do the same thing with the team. Just talk about what you're doing, et cetera, et cetera. If you could talk a little bit about just how you... The world of fashion is this world that... It's not obvious to most people how to someone get into it, and especially get to the level that you've gotten. How did you start, and what, at least at the early stages, allowed you to get here? I mean, honestly, it's not a dissimilar story to yours, right? My thing is, I think the greatest thing that anybody can do when they're young is discover their passion and what they love. I know it sounds really, really terrible, but I love stuff, and I love to shop, and I love fashion magazines, and I love to sew and create. It was the only industry I had to get into, but I went to university and signed up for all these design classes and realized I really wasn't that creative, but I had a really strong opinion on what everybody else was doing. I had a professor say that we call you a merchant, and I'm like, okay. So then I signed up for a lot of merchandising and marketing courses, so my university degree is in merchandising and marketing. In the world of what we do, I always say, I'm the monkey in the middle. We have Christopher Bailey, who's the chief creative officer, and he is so creative and so brilliant, and his whole creative team does all those videos. But then, and so that's on my right, and on my left, we have the chief financial officer, we have our chief operating officer, we have a number of our teams that have just arrived as well. And so you have this balance. So I always say, I'm a 50-50. I am half left brain and I am half right brain creative, and that was actually one of the reasons that I wanted to chat with Sal, because I said, someday, as you guys start to take over the world, you're gonna have to also start to introduce some right brain curriculum, and the Burberry Foundation would be honored to help you start creating some of those things when you're ready down the road. Oh yeah, no, and we're already starting a little bit, and we can talk more about that. But no, absolutely, and I mean, I think, and I mean, you say you're not creative, I mean, that I think you're really underselling your... Yeah, yeah, design creative. But you obviously had a very strong aesthetic. You had a sense for what... Yeah, yeah, yeah, again, I'm absolutely a merchant. And I will tell you, the reason Christopher and I created the foundation is because we are both creative thinkers. And we feel very strongly that the curriculum, specifically in America, has become so left brain, so much of the arts and things have been cut out, but it is, I think, for where the world's going, we need creative thinkers. We need, and so many times, they're getting lost out of the system. So we created the Burberry Foundation, we give 1% of our profits into the Burberry Foundation, and what we do is we try and pick up the youth that is starting to fall out of the system because they think they're dumb. Because they don't. So hopefully, we can help turn them on to you guys to help them. But if they're still just not left brain, but they're incredibly creative thinking. So we bring as many of them in as we can. We make, we show them a whole other world that companies like us need, and that's kind of been our calling. Yeah, no, it's incredible. You yourself, you said, okay, I'll be a merchant, a professor tells you this, and you just go to New York, and then you're not even 30, and you're the president of Donna Karen. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. How does that happen? And is that normal? Are there a lot of 20-somethings running major fashion houses in the world? Probably not, and probably not. And I will tell you, I'm really guilty because I'm not great talking about myself. I'm just not. Because I'm only as good always as the great teams that are around me, and no different than you guys. And so yes, I think what happens though is when you discover who you are, and you discover your passion, and then it's not work, it's your life. And so you just get into that zone. And so I was so fortunate that met the right people, things fell into place, absolutely worked my butt off because I was single alone in New York, and why not? That's all I did was... But I found my zone. I found... I found... Was there a moment where... I just find... If a member of my family says, hey, I'm gonna go to New York, and I'm gonna go work in fast, like, okay, I'll see if I can help support you at some point. That's the left brain inside of me. How did you break in, and then obviously left such a big mark with people that by the time you weren't even 30, you were president of a major fashion organization? But it's funny, I don't think of it any different than a great athlete, or a musician, or a... I think that what happens is this is all that I've ever done. And so I've always just stayed in my lane, and then you become... Whether you're a footballer, or whether you're... I didn't jump around. This is all that I've done. And I have always been so passionate about it, and I think when you direct your energy and you become so passionate, and you unite people, and you lead people all around believing in something, and then things just fall into place. And I know that, and when I say things, the revenue, the profit. So I never went in saying, I'm gonna do this. I went in saying, what if we did this? And I've always been a dreamer. My father used to always say, take off your rose colored glasses, and I would always say, no. And now I don't have to. I can keep dreaming. But the important thing I've learned is though, I have to get enough people. I have to surround myself with enough people that can help execute that dream now. And that's all that I've ever done, and I don't want to oversimplify it, but I found my zone. I absolutely love what I do. It is not work at all. I have never once woken up in the morning and said, oh, God, I gotta go to work. It's not work. This is my life. And everywhere that I've been, because it's not work, and the mantra at Burberry, or anywhere that I've been, because the stronger companies get, then the more they can do, and the bigger influence they have. And so at Burberry, we've always said that we have the power to touch and transform lives through the power of our performance. And the bigger and the stronger we get, the more we can do. And that's just always been, I'm from the heart of the Midwest, real strong family faith upbringing, and I have been raised to give. That's how I was raised. And so why wouldn't you apply that back in business? And so it's just... Yeah. I mean, I think you are underselling yourself a little bit, but I'll give you a pass on that. Thank you. The interesting thing about these, and why we video them, is I think just the Khan Academy user base. There's a lot of young people out there who, gee, how do I do that? I mean, if you had advice for someone who's 16 years old or 20 years old, and they find this world intriguing, what should they develop in themselves? And how should they think about the world? And what should they do? Well, and I always say, too, the fashion industry is deceiving, because everybody just thinks it's only this creative part. In a company like Burberry, there are 18 different departments that comprise the company. So we need... We hire a lot of people from Silicon Valley. We need great... We have 130 people just in the IT department in the company. People don't realize that. So we need extreme right, and we need extreme left. I think sometimes the fashion industry gets a short... It's the short stick sometimes when they think, oh, it's just fashion. It's just... So in order to create... And here's my thing. I always say that what we're doing is we're creating a great brand and a great company, and we happen to be in the business of fashion. We didn't set out to create a really great fashion. We set out to create a great brand. And I say that because there's a part of me that says that is your mission as well. And to what... I mean, following on that, but I do want to think about... Well, I mean, what in your mind is... What does a brand mean? I've heard multiple definitions of a brand, and how would you view Burberry's brand, and how would you view our brand? They're very similar. Good. Exploring a line of overcoats. To me, a great brand, and here's my thing. Think of yourself and when you interact with products, right? What coffee do you drink every morning? Or you might walk into Starbucks, or you might walk into... But what do you... You might have Apple products. You might... How do you feel about... And so you want to be a part of that brand, right? Because you're proud to be a part of that brand, because that brand makes you feel a certain way. And you trust that brand, and it's authentic, and it doesn't ever let you down. It exceeds your expectations. So you want to engage with it, right? And so those are all of the attributes of a great brand. Honesty, integrity, authenticity, quality, but always doing what you... To have a great engagement or... What's the word? Great brand presence, there has to be a very trusting relationship with your constituency. And in that way, we are absolutely, because your users, they have to trust what you're telling them. And if you're wrong... Yes. It happens every now and then. But it's... So to me, it's a part of what a great brand is. And in Burberry's case, and that's how we measure it. And how do you think about these things? You joined Burberry in 2006. I guess in the previous five or ten years, Burberry had kind of been rejuvenated. So if you could talk a little bit about that rejuvenation before you got there, and then when you got took over the job, and what do you tell yourself? How are you going to steer the ship? You know what I think happens, and again, we're 158 years old, and you guys are, right? But what you're building right now... No, but... So we had gone through a lot. And so we got the whole management team together. You're starting out that way, but we got the team together and said, what is our core? What is our core product proposition, and what's our core purpose? And so we realized that 158... It was 150 years then, but 158 years ago now, we were born from a coat. We had our own weaving facility in the north of England. We had our own factory that produced all of those coats. But it's interesting, we were driving innovation everywhere else but in our core product. And when everyone talked about global warming, and they gave me all the reasons why we couldn't do that. And it was kind of like, no, no, no, no, every great brand, every great brand. What would Starbucks be without coffee? Every great brand has to have a core. And I think people get bored with that. But as you grow bigger and bigger, what is your core product proposition? And don't ever lose it and keep innovating that core because people get bored really easy. But then also, what is your core purpose? Because I don't believe people just want to work, I think people all want deeper meaning in their lives. And it was hard for us, people don't just want to make stuff. People want to make stuff that has meaning and has a purpose. And so we created our core values, which are to protect, explore, and inspire. And we didn't come up with those. We took those out of a book that Thomas Burberry wrote 158 years ago when he was 21 years old and he founded the company. And we always say his spirit lives on. And it should because it was his company, it was his vision. And he created that waterproof gabardine fabric to protect the military in the trenches. That's why he created the trench coat, et cetera. So we said that is our core. That's what he founded the company on. How do we make the trench coat the most cool, relevant, hip thing in the world? That's what we were born from. Nobody else can say that but us. And so to revitalize and transform the company, we simply went back to the basics. We went back and revitalized our core. And we took that category, which was about 22% of the business, seven and a half, eight years ago. Today, it's half of the business. And when you watch a runway show, nearly every item that goes down has some type of a trench coat or some type of... So the innovation that we've driven in that core, and that has single-handedly Harvard Business Review did a great article on just that topic, revitalizing the core. And I mean, how do you decide on that? Is that just a gut instinct? I mean, or is there some data that you look at? Or we look at all the brands that have a core versus don't have a core? I mean, how do... Or is it just a... And on that, and then as you move and continue to innovate and get new products, I'm sure every day someone comes through, hey, we should have a line of whatever it might be. How do you decide how much of it is analytically driven and how much of it is gut or whatever else driven? It's a great question. It's a great question. So I'm gonna answer it three ways. So one is we always say that we are a creative thinking company and everything we do is driven by intuition. And then we confuse ourselves with facts. But we always, always lead with intuition. And because we always say that we do value feeling over knowing. Because if we only focused on knowing, we'd never move forward because you can't prove something that hasn't been done before. So we are, and that is a part of being a creative thinking culture. And I forgot my other two because I told you there were three. So you confuse yourself with facts. I mean, what does that mean? Does that mean that you feel or collectively, not just you, the whole organization feels like something's the right direction. But what if someone says, hey, but look, everyone who's gone into this space before has failed. There's 800 players already in that market. They get zero margin on what they're doing. It's being, you know, it's a commodity. Do you ignore that? Do you sometimes ignore that? Do you say, no, we still feel good about it and you move ahead? So, seven years ago, came up with all the hard, we call them hard strategies. And those are all the ones that are very fact-based, right? So when we talked about retail led growth, brought in a consultant company, told us, I said, tell me every key market in the world that has, where our peers have at least two stores and we have none, right? And then tell me their productivity per square foot. So we had a strategy, put all the hard metrics behind it. But the gut, you know, our instincts were, and we were 75% wholesale when I started. Today, we are 75% retail, our own stores, direct to consumer. So our instincts said we had to go direct to consumer, we had to control the brand, the environment, everything. And so then again, brought in the firm, but we did that on every strategy and they would reaffirm, etc. So then I put them in front of the board. Very first, been the company six months, strategies are done, everything's outlined, we know exactly where we're going. And at the very end, they told the board, and we said at that point in time, we would double the revenue and the profits in five years. And they, the guy, I won't mention the company on video, but the guy stands up at the end of the meeting and he tells, and the board says, well, how do you feel about this going through it? And he says, there's about a 5% probability that they will do this. And who's this guy? Well, he works for a huge consulting firm and I'm not gonna mention the firm. Okay, all right. But we had them come in and for six months, we had them work with us on validating these strategies. Right. And so this strategy was based, there was a number strategy where you're looking at the retail density and different geographies and how productive those stores are. And so that is what you use to decide where you're going to go? Yeah, again, there's always both. There's always the, well, and that was the other part of the thing I just forgot. So one was intuition, but the other is balance. So we talk a lot about the right and the left. A lot. So when we had five hard strategies and we had five soft strategies. So the foundation was a soft strategy, the culture was the soft, all of the comp and bend, free lunch, the benefits for all of this stuff were all the soft strategies. And we said that these will enable those. But just focusing on these, we may not get the job done. So the consulting firm didn't work with us on the soft things. They only worked with us on the hard. So when they told the board, there's only a 5% probability, you know, the board kind of like we're nuts, but we actually achieved the plan a year early. And they thought it was a 5% probability because they've advised you on a lot of the fact part of the analytical stuff. They thought we were being far too aggressive. But the aggressive, when you said you're going to double your revenues, you said? And profit in five years. That was the part that they were giving you a 5% probability. They said, no, I'm sure you'll grow, et cetera, et cetera. But to really, to really, and the soft things are just stuff that felt right. Was this? The soft things were that we knew, we knew, I knew that we would be as good as our people. And that we had to, we had to build a team. We had to unite and connect this culture. And they had to believe in the dream. Right? And this is leadership. And they had to lead everybody. So we were 3,200 people then. And some of the people had been with us 30 years, 40 years. But how do you get everybody united around a new vision, a new dream? And the thing is, is they have to believe, every single person has to believe you can do this. That's the positive energy that comes around something when you are breaking new ground or trying to do something transformative like you are. And if they don't believe, and I told them up front after that six months, I said, if you do not believe that we're going to do this, then maybe you should go now. Right? Because we knew we wanted to do something really big and transformative. So we used our instincts, we confused ourselves with the facts, and then we built a very balanced strategy, hard and soft, very balanced teams. So we need creatives, but we need operational excellence. And the strategies were built that way. And so I always say, in every single store we have, we need left brain and we need right, in every country, in every region, because I don't think you'll build a great brand that resonates and touches people without both. You need the engagement, but you need the reach. And they're very different. And the projection of doubling, there was no precedent for this. I mean, that's probably why I thought that was the thing. Well, the precedent was they had done it before. I see. The possibility of a company doing it twice was what really took the odds down. Right. And I mean, through that process, were there moments where, I mean, you yourself were like, gee, I don't know if this is going to happen. You were just... Never. Never. That's why I am too. Never doubt. Never. I'm always doubting. You are not. Not really. No, you're not. No, I think he's a bigger dreamer than I am. Maybe. We can compete. No, but you have to. Because you are on, you are disrupting a sector that is so overdue to be disrupted. It is so overdue. And the next generation is in your hands, and they need you to do this. The country needs you to do what you're doing. You got to do it, and you got to keep going. And you got to get your reach out there. You are engaging. I mean, the fact that 30,000 teachers are using your content in schools, I don't know. It's unbelievable. Get it to 100. Get it to 200. You just don't stop. Can you Skype in to our company updates? It would be very... I would. I want to... Let's do this. Let's... It's not... Yeah. But that's how I feel. Yeah. I mean, that is how I feel. You and if you... And it's not going to be easy. But don't stop. Yeah. I mean, what... Well, that by itself is really powerful advice and feedback. I mean, what would you tell us? I mean, as we go... I mean, we're... You're 158 years old. We're 158 weeks old. I mean, how do we... Any advice for... I mean, beyond that, just kind of ultra-focus, believe, power through? Definitely focus. Yeah. And we still do the same thing today. We always say that every year, we only do three new things. That's it. Because, you know, they take... You know, we call them big brand moments. I mean, whether it was launching Burberry.com, I mean, it took us a year to unite thousands of people around the world. And we said that we had to do this and we had one chance to change 150 years of perception. So we knew that... We knew that that... And this year, they'll be pretty close to 100 million people to go on to Burberry.com. You guys are up to a lot. But for a luxury brand, that's a lot. That's pretty good. That's a lot. Yeah. And not all buying, but engaging and spreading what the brand's about, et cetera. But three things a year. And we still hold on to that, no matter how big we are. That's not individual products. That is new initiatives like Burberry.com. Exactly. Three big brand things that we unite 10,000 people around the world to do. And what's kind of next in the queue? What are the three things y'all are doing now? It's probably no surprise that we are aggressively continuing to work on our digital platform. Specifically when it comes to mobile. The whole world is becoming mobile. It's crazy all the metrics of the consumers that are engaging. That's probably a challenge to you guys too, because that is where you'll get your kid. That is where on a mobile device, not just a phone, but any mobile device. The whole world, it's just so heavy investment, a lot of focus going there. So digital, mobile, et cetera. And we always have operational or internal initiatives as well. So we do as we get big. Areas get sloppy. So we still have to drive a lot of efficiencies out of the business. So we call it commercial procurement. We build tons of stores a year. So we've hired some additional expertise to make sure we're doing that in the most efficient way. So right now, if you ask any of our executives around the world, they know those are the three things that we're focused on this year. And if we do those right, we will put up the results that we've budgeted, et cetera. Wow. And you're all growing fast. I mean, for a large company, you all grew 24, 25% last year. That's fairly dramatic. We just put up this year's results. We just did our trading update a couple weeks ago, and our retail business was up 13% on a really, really big base. That's not what global retail is doing today. No, no. Our largest competitor put up a 3% retail business, and they're the biggest in the sector. So no, we're absolutely continuing to outperform, but I will tell you, it's because it's the people, because there are 10,000 people around the world that are so passionate about this company and so passionate about our performance and creating, again, a great brand, a really great company. But they also know that every time we open a flagship store, because again, it's kind of shallow luxury retail, right? And that always bothered Christopher and I, because it's not where we came from, right? We love what we're doing, and that's why we've been focused on a great company. But every time we open a flagship store, we partner with a local institution. So in Chicago, we partnered with Hive, and we gifted them a million dollars, and we created a program to help the youth in the Chicago area with our programs, Burberry Beyond, et cetera. So we've done it in New York, we've done it in Beijing, we're getting ready to do it in Shanghai. So any time we open up this huge luxury store, which could come across a little elitist, if you will, we always make sure that the company also, you know, like in New York, we said we're lighting up Manhattan with the store. Well, we're also going to light up people's lives when we gave the million dollars to the Robin Hood Foundation and put our program in place for the Chartered Schools, et cetera. So, you know, and that's a big part of the balance, and that's a part of being a great company. When you look in the organization, you must be looking at people, oh, look at him, look at her. Mmm, that's, she's got some potential. He's got some potential. Hey, that could be the next CEO. What are you looking at? What are the traits that you're seeing in those people that are really striking you as someone who might be able to one day step into your shoes? Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. That's a great question. And we look at it, honestly, at all levels of the company. And I would even say probably less my shoes, right, because, you know, that would mostly be a lot of my direct reports, et cetera. So I would tell you at every level of the company, and we hire for it as well. So sounds terrible, but we culturally compatible. We always say we don't want tissue rejection because it's tough to bring people into your culture. Tissue rejection, like, oh, and these skin grafting, or, yes, it's the wrong blood type. So people go through such rigor before we bring them into the company, and we always say, are they culturally compatible? Do we trust them? Do we like them, obviously? Do we trust them? Do we believe them? Do they believe in our mission and what we're doing? Because we can't afford to make a mistake. So I would tell you with anybody going to the next level, there is transparency, trust, our core values, all those soft things we talked about. When they reach a certain level, it's a given they're smart. It's a given they have high IQ. But we need high EQ. And I always say that everybody in the company needs a little right and left brain, right? Two extremes because then they don't feel. And we always say that we can teach people anything, but we can't teach them to care. We can't teach them to feel. And when you're in a human business and you're communicating like we're communicating, they have to be authentic. We have a leadership council, which is the next generation talent. And we spend hours just helping them understand who they are. Who are they? Because then only if they really know who they are can they build very balanced teams around them. And it's a real self-reflective phase that they go through, but they will become better leaders having peace and confidence with who they are and to thyself be true. And so that is a part of our talent plan. And I always say no different than me. I tell investors, you would be so surprised at every decision I don't make every day. But you can't. I have to trust the people we brought in. And I have to give them very simple, clear messages. The three things we're going to do this year and all the metrics behind it and uniting everyone. But it is trust, intuition, great communication, authenticity. People have to feel them or they will never rise as a leader in the company. And is it something that you think you can, I mean, you talk about personality fit and cultural fit. Do you trust them? But is there some way that you can screen for that, for that balance of the whole brain? I read the whole book now. It's fascinating. Very good book. Did you really read it? I did. I read it on the plane. It's a long flight. I gave him a copy of Daniel Pink's book. It's called The Whole Mind. Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the World. And one thing that I pointed out to you, because one thing that I did react to that book, it's funny because in that book they said, oh, we don't need programmers anymore. We need inventors. I said, well, what's a programmer? It's an inventor. It is fundamentally a right-brained activity. And so I actually am a strong, so when people say, oh, Khan Academy STEM, I was like, STEM is, it should be a right-brained activity. In my mind, the learning to factor a polynomial or to do the basics of algorithms, that's like a painter learning how to paint. But the real expression is when you actually create something. So I actually think we're more similar than more people. I think so too. But I think that's what you've unlocked. I think that's your unique brand positioning. Right. The creative. You're taking what most people would take as a traditional left brain, and you're adding, you're adding fun to it. You're adding energy to it. And you're making it, you're combining, you're making it more of a right-left brain exercise, not just an analytical exercise. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. And how are we doing on time? OK. Three more minutes. So I will ask you again, because it was so inspiring, and the dopamine just started. We were talking about dopamine earlier today, and I got us all very excited. I won't ask. Yeah. We were talking about, well, and other things. But the, I mean, just parting words, advice for the team here, and people, the greater Khan Academy community. Thoughts on just what we should be doing, and how we should approach life. Yeah. You know, you are, it's funny because I had the honor, right before the Olympics, Mr. Bill Gates was in London and had a wonderful luncheon. And we'd met a couple of different times, and I had the honor of sitting next to him at the luncheon table. And he was talking about all of his different philanthropic efforts, et cetera, and to the who's who of the UK, if you will. And he hadn't mentioned the Khan Academy. And I was so excited why, you know. So at the very end, he simply said, is there anything else? And I said, well, what are your plans for the Khan Academy? And he kind of looked at me like, how did I know about this? And nobody in the room knew about it. And these are huge, big executives running Glaxo and every big company in the UK. And so he then went on to share with them what you were doing and why that he felt strongly and his foundation was investing, et cetera. And then the luncheon broke, and then he looked at me and he goes, well, what would you do? And I said, you created the greatest brand in the world, Microsoft. I mean, you, you know, and you just, you were so laser and you had such a vision. And I said, it is absolutely no different with the Khan Academy. I believe you had the ability to create one of the greatest brands and one of the greatest companies in the world. His I said, I told him, I said, when you did it, there was a need and you filled that need. There is a tremendous need and you are filling that need. And it's in a different way, but you're using and you're leveraging the technology that exists today as he did. And, and, and he then sent a follow up note afterwards saying, you know, could we continue the conversation? I found it, you know, I found it fascinating, et cetera. And I shared this with you because to have at this young age that you are, to have someone of his vision and his caliber believe in you, you know, you know, you know, you're on the right track. And I just think that, you know, I am absolutely nothing in comparison to the people that are watching you, the people that are following you, the lives that you're, you're impacting, you're impacting teachers' lives, you're impacting the next generation. You are actually impacting people who didn't finish their education, who are going on and learning now. And so, you know, you will create a phenomenal brand. You will create an amazing company and you are in the midst of disrupting a sector that is so desperately in need of, of being fixed. And you're doing it in such a modern way, leveraging everything that exists today. And my counsel to you is just don't stop and don't slow down and, and, you know, stay focused, keep the right pace, but, but do truly understand that what you're doing has far greater meaning than anything you've ever done in your lives before. And not just does America need you to do this, the world needs you to do this. Education is the biggest issue that, that, that the, you know, inhibiting future economies all over the world. So I just, I just, I am so honored to be here to chat with you and, and just, I am so thankful for what you're doing. I really am. Well, I feel like going back to work now. No, well, thank you so much. I mean, this was, I mean, for me personally, when we met in Heathrow with my $6 shirt on, that by itself was a really powerful, I mean, Esther was there too. And we were like, she's amazing. And Esther is the number one search result on Olympic attitude on Google. So she has authority here, but we were transfixed and blown away by meeting you then. And this, I think, I think I could speak for everyone where this was incredibly inspiring and motivating for, for all of us. So thank you so much. Now you are more than welcome. Keep up the great work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
