        "A": "Current measurement instruments are not precise enough to simultaneously determine both position and momentum, but future advances in detector technology will overcome this purely instrumental limitation \u2014 the uncertainty principle reflects a practical engineering barrier rather than a fundamental physical law, and quantum computing technology will eventually enable simultaneous high-precision measurements of conjugate variables",

This is not a measurement limitation but an intrinsic property of quantum states",
        "C": "The act of measurement always disturbs the particle by transferring a random and uncontrollable amount of energy and momentum from the apparatus",

This photonic speed advantage gives quantum computers an exponential speedup over classical computers for every computational problem, regardless of algorithmic considerations",

        "A": "Frequent measurements physically cool the quantum system by extracting kinetic energy during each measurement interaction, reducing the system's total energy below the threshold required for the decay or transition to occur \u2014 this measurement-induced cooling mechanism is analogous to laser cooling of atoms, where repeated photon scattering events remove kinetic energy, and the Zeno effect is simply a special case of this general cooling phenomenon applied to unstable quantum states",
        "B": "The physical measuring apparatus creates a potential energy barrier that blocks the decay products from escaping the quantum system \u2014 each time a measurement is performed, the apparatus exerts a short-range force on the system that confines the decay products to the vicinity of the parent state, and with sufficiently frequent measurements, this confinement force maintains the system in its initial undecayed state indefinitely",
        "C": "Each measurement projects the system back onto its initial undecayed state \u2014 at very short times, the survival probability decreases quadratically ($P \\approx 1 - (t/\\tau_Z)^2$) rather than exponentially, so frequent projections onto the initial state keep resetting this quadratic onset, effectively freezing the evolution",

        "B": "Topological qubits use physically larger particles (such as entire molecules or nanoparticles) as their information carriers instead of the single atoms, electrons, or photons used in conventional quantum computing \u2014 these larger particles have more internal degrees of freedom that can absorb perturbations without affecting the encoded quantum information, providing an error-correcting buffer analogous to the thermal mass of a large object that resists temperature changes",
