In my classroom I always ask them, who are you? They know to respond, I am the leader of the world. And it's true, they're the future. The importance of teachers is done quantifiable for the success of students because we do not just teach but we really care about our students. We're also their mentors, we're also their friends. Every teacher uses different tools to be an effective teacher. One of those tools that I choose to use because I believe the curriculum, the rigor in it is Khan Academy. So it gives me immediate feedback of, okay, this person understands or this person doesn't. Every student, every child, every life has the possibility to create something. Everyone deserves access to free, quality education. Then we can really see the power of education blossoming.
