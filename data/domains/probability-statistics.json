The posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E equals the likelihood of E given H, times the prior probability of H, divided by the marginal probability of E.

Researchers frequently assume that if p < 0.05, the treatment or intervention has a meaningful practical effect size, when in fact with large enough sample sizes even trivially small effects that have no real-world importance produce extremely small p-values. The p-value only measures whether an effect is nonzero, not whether the magnitude of that effect has any practical consequence for decision-making",

Once the interval is calculated from the data, the parameter is either inside it or not, but we can assign a 95% posterior probability to it being inside because the interval was constructed using a procedure that accounts for sampling variability.

This frequentist interpretation contrasts with Bayesian credible intervals, where P(\u03b8 \u2208 CI | data) = 0.95 is a valid statement because \u03b8 is treated as a random variable with a posterior distribution",
        "C": "A 95% confidence interval captures 95% of the individual data points in the sample, serving as a range within which most future observations from the same population would fall. This makes the CI essentially identical to a prediction interval, where a wider interval indicates greater dispersion of individual values around the central estimate.

        "A": "There is no meaningful difference between Bayesian and frequentist statistics \u2014 both frameworks always produce identical point estimates, confidence/credible intervals, and hypothesis test conclusions when applied to the same data. The apparent differences are purely philosophical and have no practical consequences for data analysis. Any Bayesian analysis can be exactly replicated by a frequentist procedure through appropriate choice of test statistic and rejection region, and conversely any frequentist procedure corresponds to a Bayesian analysis with some implicit prior distribution. The distinction persists in textbooks only for historical reasons, as the mathematical equivalence between the two approaches was definitively proven by Lindley's theorem in the 1950s",
        "B": "Bayesian statistics was the dominant framework throughout the 19th century but has been conclusively shown to be logically incoherent by frequentist critiques, particularly the problem of prior sensitivity. Because different prior distributions lead to different posterior conclusions, Bayesian inference introduces unavoidable subjectivity that makes scientific results non-reproducible. The frequentist framework resolves this by basing all inference on the sampling distribution of test statistics, which depends only on the data and the assumed model. Modern computational advances such as MCMC have made Bayesian calculations feasible, but this computational convenience does not address the fundamental logical flaw of requiring prior specification that influences the final conclusions in ways that cannot be objectively validated",
        "C": "Frequentist statistics works optimally with small samples because its exact tests, such as Fisher's exact test and the exact binomial test, make no asymptotic approximations. Bayesian statistics works only with large samples because the posterior distribution converges to the true parameter value only as the sample size approaches infinity, via the Bernstein-von Mises theorem. With small samples, the Bayesian posterior is dominated by the prior and provides unreliable inferences. This complementarity means that researchers should use frequentist methods when data are scarce and switch to Bayesian methods only when hundreds or thousands of observations are available, which is the opposite of common practice in fields like clinical trials and psychometrics",
        "D": "The core difference is the interpretation of probability: frequentists define probability as long-run frequency (parameters are fixed but unknown, data are random), while Bayesians define probability as degree of belief (parameters have probability distributions reflecting uncertainty). In practice, this matters: Bayesian methods naturally incorporate prior information, provide posterior distributions (not just point estimates), and answer the question 'what do I believe about the parameter given the data?' while frequentist methods answer 'how would this procedure perform if repeated many times?' With informative priors and small samples, results can differ substantially; with vague priors and large samples, they typically agree"

This minimization is solved by finding the eigenvectors of the inverse covariance matrix \u03a3\u207b\u00b9, with the smallest eigenvalues corresponding to the most important components since they represent the directions of least dispersion.

      "options": {
        "A": "FDR and FWER are identical concepts that use different notation but control exactly the same error rate. Both the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure divide the significance level \u03b1 by the number of tests m, producing the same adjusted threshold for declaring significance. The only difference is computational: the Bonferroni method uses a simple division \u03b1/m while the BH procedure sorts p-values and compares each to a linearly increasing threshold, but these two approaches always agree on which null hypotheses to reject. Claims that FDR is less conservative than FWER are based on simulations that used incorrect implementations of the Bonferroni correction, and properly implemented Bonferroni controls are equally powerful as BH for any configuration of true and false null hypotheses",
        "B": "Multiple testing corrections are unnecessary in modern statistics because the original significance threshold of \u03b1 = 0.05 already accounts for the possibility of conducting multiple tests. The 5% error rate is a per-experiment rate, not a per-test rate, meaning that as long as all tests are conducted within a single study, the overall false positive rate remains at 5% regardless of how many tests are performed. This is a consequence of the closure principle in hypothesis testing, which guarantees that the familywise error rate of a collection of tests never exceeds the nominal level of each individual test when the tests are performed on the same dataset. Corrections like Bonferroni and BH are therefore overly conservative and substantially reduce statistical power without providing any additional error control",
        "C": "FWER (Bonferroni) controls P(\u22651 false positive among all tests), becoming extremely conservative as the number of tests grows (dividing \u03b1 by m). FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg, 1995) instead controls E[false positives / total positives] \u2014 the expected proportion of false discoveries among rejected hypotheses. This is less conservative because it allows some false positives as long as they are a controlled fraction of discoveries. For genomics (testing 20,000+ genes), Bonferroni gives virtually no discoveries, while BH at FDR = 0.05 identifies hundreds of plausible candidates. FDR control was a breakthrough because it matched the scientific goal: controlling the quality of a list of discoveries, not eliminating all errors",
        "D": "FWER control is always preferable to FDR control in every application because controlling the probability of at least one false positive is the only scientifically meaningful error criterion. FDR control allows a specified proportion of rejections to be false positives, which means that published results using FDR corrections contain a known fraction of incorrect findings that have been deliberately accepted as false. This undermines scientific credibility because readers cannot determine which specific results are true and which are the accepted false positives. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure gained popularity only because it produces more significant results, not because it provides better error control, making it a form of statistical p-hacking disguised as a principled correction"

Randomized controlled trials are better than observational studies for establishing association but still cannot establish causation, as the assignment mechanism eliminates confounding but does not create a causal link. The apparent success of causal inference in medicine and social science reflects consistent patterns of strong association rather than true identification of causal mechanisms, which remain forever beyond the reach of statistical methodology",

The individual causal effect Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) is therefore unobservable. We can only estimate average causal effects (ATE = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]) under assumptions: randomization (ensures independence of treatment and potential outcomes), SUTVA (no interference between units), and positivity (nonzero probability of each treatment for all covariate levels). When randomization fails, methods like propensity score matching, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity attempt to recover causal effects from observational data under additional assumptions",
        "C": "The fundamental problem of causal inference is that observational studies always have insufficient sample sizes to detect true causal effects, because confounding variables introduce additional sources of variation that inflate the standard errors of treatment effect estimates.
