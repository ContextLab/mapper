We're asked, what's the first wrong statement in the proof below that triangle BCE, so that's this middle triangle right over here, is congruent to triangle BCA, that's this top triangle right over there. And they tell us that BC is parallel to DF and that the diagram is not drawn to scale, fair enough. So we're gonna see if they're, we're essentially gonna check their proof to see if it's either correct or if there's a wrong statement in it. So let's look at the givens. They tell us that angle BAC is congruent to angle BED. So BAC, congruent to BED. AC is congruent to DE. AC is congruent to DE. ACB congruent to BDE. So this is BDE, this is ACB. BC is congruent to CF. So BC is congruent to CF, just double click there to get the two slashes. Angle ABC is congruent to angle CFE. ABC CFE, so that's this one, triple click there to get three of those to show that that's not a congruent or we don't know whether they're congruent to these other angles. So that's those two and then angle BAC, which we've already marked, is congruent to CEF. So this angle is congruent to this one, so this one will be just one slash. So now let's go through their proof and see if it makes actual sense. So this first statement they make is BDE is congruent to BCA because of angle side angle. Angle side angle, let's see if that's a, it looks like that's right, because you have your double arc angle, then your single side, and then your single arc angle. Double arc angle, single slash side, and then single arc angle. So you have angle side angle. It is legitimate, this is a legitimate statement here. So I'm cool with that, that's not gonna be incorrect. Then they say angle ACB is congruent to DBE, is congruent to DBE because vertical angles are equal. ACB and DBE, well this makes absolutely no sense. Those aren't vertical angles. You could, you could, yep, those just aren't vertical angles. Vertical angles, actually there's the way that this is drawn here. There aren't any vertical angles, but ACB and DBE are definitely not vertical angles. So we're actually done. We have found the incorrect statement. This is not true. ACB is not congruent to DBE because of vertical angles. So the wrong statement of this proof was a statement that tries to do that because of vertical angles. So let's check our answer, and it is correct.
