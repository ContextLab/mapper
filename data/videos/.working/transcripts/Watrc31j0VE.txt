- [David] The power, Wordsmiths, the power. The words we're gonna take apart with our bare hands today
are dynamic and durable. So, I'll define the words, I'll break them into their word parts, and name some related words, and then I'll use them in sentences. Let's start with dynamic. It's an adjective, it
means active and energetic. Which we could say about a person, but it also means constantly changing, which is less frequently
applied to people. Durable is also an adjective, and it means strong or long-lasting. A durable thing is tough and sturdy. I love both of these words so much. Let's talk about their origins. Dynamic comes from the
Greek word dynamikos, meaning powerful, the
root dyn means power. The 17th and 18th century mathematician, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,
was the first person to use dynamic in physics
to describe powerful forces. Leibniz is cool. Maybe you've heard of Sir Isaac Newton, the apple to the head gravity
guy from England, yeah. Leibniz was like his math arch enemy. They discovered calculus, which is a type of math at the same time. It's a whole big thing. Other words that contain
the root dyn include dynamite, the powerfully
explosive substance, dynamo, which is literally a machine that makes electricity, but also a word for a
very energetic person, and dynasty, which is a powerful
family, like a royal house. We might speak of the Han
dynasty in Chinese history, or the Bourbon dynasty in French history. Durable, this word comes
from the Latin root dur, meaning hard, strong, lasting. Related words include, endure, to put up with something unpleasant, to outlast an experience. Like the horrific
experimental jazz concert I endured in Argentina in 2013. Three hours of weird little honks. A story for another
time, da, da, da, da, da. Duration, how long something
lasts, a time period. Five minutes is a short duration. Five centuries is a very long duration. And duress, hard circumstances
that involve force. If I had to make my bed under duress, that means someone made me
do it and I didn't wanna. However, I am acting of my own free will when I tell you that I
want to use these words in some sentences. To Ramona, no music was
more dynamic than Hyperjazz. Its shifting rhythms, the
way band members swapped instruments with one another. It thrilled her. It was powerful and constantly changing. It was exciting. Fiona's durable hiking pants were tested to their limits on Daggerback Mountain. How strong? How long lasting were her very expensive ripstop nylon trousers? Only the mountain could know for sure. I hope your love of words remains dynamic and durable, Wordsmiths. I hope it lasts long into the future, changing to meet your needs. I think it just might. Until next time. You can learn anything, David out.
