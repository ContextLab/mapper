So let's calculate what 2 fifths divided by 7 thirds is. And I encourage you to pause this video and try to calculate this on your own. Well, we just have to remind ourselves that this is going to be the exact same thing as 2 over 5 times the reciprocal of 7 thirds, which is 3 over 7. And then multiplying two fractions is pretty straightforward. This is just going to be equal to the product of the numerators. So 2 times 3 over the product of the denominators, over 5 times 7. Trying to keep the colors consistent. 5 times 7, which of course is going to be equal to 2 times 3 is equal to 6. And 5 times 7, I'll do this in a new color. Let's see, I haven't used this shade of blue yet. 5 times 7, of course, is equal to 35. So this is equal to 6 35ths.
