So what I want to do in this video is give ourselves an overview of cellular respiration. And it can be a pretty involved process. And even the way I'm going to do it, as messy as it looks, it's going to be cleaner than actually what goes on inside of your cells and other organism cells. Because I'm going to show clearly from going from glucose and then see how we can produce ATP through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. But in reality, all sorts of molecules can jump in at different parts of the chain and then jump out at different parts of the chain to go along other pathways. But I'll show kind of the traditional narrative. So we're going to start off with, for this narrative, we're going to start off with glucose. We have a six carbon chain right over here. And we have the process of glycolysis, which is occurring in the cytosol of our cells. So if this is the cell right over here, you can imagine, well, the glycolysis could be occurring right over there. And that process of glycolysis is essentially splitting up this six carbon glucose molecule into two, three carbon molecules. And these three carbon molecules, we go into detail in another video, we call these pyruvate. And in the process of doing so, and this is, I guess you could say, the point of glycolysis, we're able to, on a net basis, produce two ATPs. We actually produce four, but we have to use two. So on a net basis, we produce two ATPs. And I'm going to keep a little table here to keep track. So we produce two ATPs. And we are also, we're also in the process of that, we reduce two NAD molecules to NADH. Remember, reduction is gaining of electrons. And you see over here, this is positively charged, this is neutrally charged, it essentially gains a hydride. So this is reduction. Reduction. And if we go all the way through the pathway, all the way to oxidative phosphorylation, the electron transport chain, these NADHs, the reduced form of NAD, they can be then oxidized to provide, and in doing so, more energy is provided to provide, to produce even more ATPs. But we'll get to that. So you're also going to get two NADHs. Two NADHs get produced. Now at that point, you could kind of think of it as a little bit of a decision point. If there's no oxygen around, or if you're the type of organism that doesn't want to continue for some reason with cellular respiration or doesn't know how, this pyruvate can be used for fermentation. And we have videos on fermentation, lactic acid fermentation, alcohol fermentation. And fermentation is all about using the pyruvates to oxidize your NADH back into NAD, so it could be reused again for glycolysis. So even though the NADH has energy that could be eventually converted to ATP, and even though the pyruvates have energy that could eventually be converted into ATP, when you do fermentation, you kind of give up on that and you just view them as waste projects and you use the pyruvate to convert the NADH back into NAD and then glycolysis can occur again. But let's assume we're not going to go down the fermentation pathway, and we're going to continue with traditional aerobic cellular respiration using oxygen. Well the next thing that's going to happen is that the carboxyl group, and everything I'm going to show now, it's going to happen for each of these pyruvates. So you can imagine these things all happening twice. So I'm going to multiply a bunch of things times two. But what happens in the next step is this carboxyl group, this carboxyl group is stripped off of the pyruvate and it essentially is going to be released as carbon dioxide, so this is our carbon dioxide being released here, and then the rest of our pyruvate, which is essentially an acetyl group, that latches on to coenzyme A. And you'll hear a lot about coenzyme A, sometimes they'll write just coA like this, sometimes they'll do coA and then the sulfur will connect bonded to the hydrogen. And the reason why they'll draw the sulfur part is because the sulfur is what bonds with the acetyl group right over here. So you have the carbon dioxide being released and then the acetyl group bonding with that sulfur and by doing that you form acetyl coA. And acetyl coA, just so you only see three letters here, but this is actually a fairly involved molecule. This is actually a picture of acetyl coA, I know it's really small, but hopefully you appreciate it's a more involved molecule that the acetyl group that we're talking about is just this part right over here. And it's a coenzyme, it's really acting to transfer that acetyl group and we'll see that in a second. But it's also fun to look at these molecules because once again we see these patterns over and over again in biology or biochemistry. Acetyl coA, you have an adenine right over here. It's hard to see, but you have a ribose and you also have two phosphate groups. So this end of the acetyl coA is essentially, an ADP, but it's used as a coenzyme. Everything that I'm talking about, this is all going to be facilitated by enzymes and the enzymes will have co-factors, coenzymes, if we're talking about organic cofactors, that are gonna help facilitate things along. And as we see, the acetyl group joins on to the coenzyme A, forming acetyl coA, but that's just a temporary attachment. That the acetyl coA is essentially gonna transfer the acetyl group over to, and now we're going to enter into the citric acid cycle. It's gonna transfer these two carbons over to oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid. So it's gonna transfer these two carbons to this one, two, three, four carbon molecule to form a one, two, three, four, five, six carbon molecule. But before we go into the depths of the citric acid cycle, I wanna make sure that I don't lose track of my accounting because even that step right over here where we decarboxylated the pyruvate, we went from pyruvate to acetyl coA, that also reduced some NAD to NADH. Now this is gonna happen once for each pyruvate, but we're gonna, all the accounting we're gonna say is for one glucose molecule. So for one glucose molecule, it's gonna happen for each of the pyruvates. So this is going to be times, this is going to be times two. So we're gonna produce two NADHs in this step going from pyruvate to acetyl coA. Now the bulk of, I guess you could say the catabolism of the carbons or the things that are eventually going to produce our ATPs are going to happen in what we call the citric acid or the Krebs cycle. It's called the citric acid cycle because when we transferred the acetyl group from the coenzyme A to the oxaloacetic acid, we formed citric acid. And citric acid, this is the thing that you have in lemons or orange juice. It is this molecule right over here. And the citric acid cycle, and it's also called the Krebs cycle, when you first learn it seems very, very complex and some could argue that it is quite complex, but I'm just gonna give you an overview of what's going on. The citric acid, once again, six carbon, it keeps getting broken down through multiple steps and I'm really not showing all of the detail here, all the way back to oxaloacetic acid where then it can accept the two carbons again. And just to be clear, once the two carbons are released by the coenzyme A, then that coenzyme A can be used again to decarboxylate some pyruvate. So there's a bunch of cycles going on. But the important takeaway is as we go through the citric acid cycle, as we go from one intermediary to the next, we keep reducing NAD to NADH. In fact, we do this three times for each cycle of the citric acid cycle. But remember, we're gonna do this for each acetyl-CoA, for each pyruvate. So all of this stuff is going to happen twice. So we're gonna go through it twice for each original glucose molecule. So here we have one, two, three NADHs being produced, but since we're gonna go through it twice and we're gonna be accounting for the original glucose molecule, we could say that we have six NADHs, or you could say six NADs get reduced to NADH. Now you also, in the process, as you're breaking down, going from the six carbon molecule to a four carbon molecule, you're releasing carbon, that's carbon dioxide. And you also have traditionally GDP being converted into GTP, or sometimes ADP converted to ATP, but functionally it's equivalent to ATP either way. So we could also say that we're gonna directly, remember, we're gonna do all of this stuff twice. So we could say that two, I'll just say two ATPs to make it simple, we could say GTP, but I'll say two ATPs, because once again, this happens once in each cycle, but we're gonna do two cycles for each glucose. And then we have this other coenzyme right over here, FAD, that gets reduced to FADH2, but that stays covalently attached to the enzymes that are facilitating it, so eventually, that's being used to reduce coenzyme Q to QH2. So I'm just gonna write the QH2 here, but once again, you're gonna get two of these. So two Q2H2s. Now let's think about what the net product over here is going to be, and to think about it, we should just, we'll just, and I'll do a little bit of a shorthand, we'll go into more detail in future videos, is these coenzymes, the NADH, the QH2, these are going to be oxidized during oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain to create a proton gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. And we're gonna go into much more detail in the future, but that proton gradient is going to be used to produce more ATP. And one way to think about it is each NADH, each NADH is going to produce, and I've seen accounts, it depends on the efficiency of where the NADH is actually going to be produced, but it's going to produce anywhere between two and three ATPs. The each of the reduced coenzyme Qs, so the QH2, that's going to each produce about one and a half ATPs, and people are still getting a good handle on exactly how this is happening, it depends on the efficiency of the cell and what the cell is actually trying to do. So using these ranges, actually I'll say one and a half to two ATPs, and these are our approximate numbers, so let's think about what our total accounting is. So if we just count up the ATP or the GTPs, we're gonna get two there, two there, so we're gonna have four direct, or very close to direct ATPs net being created. And then how many NADHs? We have two, four, and then we add six, we have 10 NADHs, 10 NADHs, and then we have two of the coenzyme Qs, two QH2s, so that's gonna be four ATPs, this is going to be between 20 and 30 ATPs, sorry, 20 and 30 ATPs, 20 to 30 ATPs, and then this is going to be three to four ATPs. So if you add them all together, if you add the low ends of the range, you get, let's see, 20 plus three plus four, that's 27 ATPs, 27 ATPs, and the high end of the range, let's see, you have four plus 30 plus four, you have 38, 38 ATPs, and 38 ATPs is currently considered to be kind of a theoretical maximum, but when we actually observe things in cells, it looks like it comes around at around 29 to 30 ATPs, and this, once again, depends what the cell's trying to do, the type of cells and the type of efficiency, but all of this is happening through cellular respiration, and just to get a better sense of where all of this is occurring, where all of this is occurring, we said glycolysis is occurring in the cytosol, the citric acid cycle, this is occurring in the matrix of the mitochondria, so this space right over here, that is the citric acid cycle and that little magenta space that I've drawn, so that's the matrix, the video on mitochondria, we go into much more detail on that, and then the actual conversion of these coenzymes of the electron transport chain, that's occurring across the membrane of the crista, and the crista are these folds, these kind of inner membrane folds of our mitochondria, so it's occurring across that, across the membranes of these, actually the plural is cristae, cristae is the singular, of the cristae, and we'll go into more detail into that in other videos.
