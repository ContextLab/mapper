We are asked, what is the volume of this box? And they tell us that each cube is a cubic foot. So just as a reminder, a volume is a measure of how much space does something take up. And it's usually measured in cubic units. And here, we're talking about cubic feet. And when they say that each cube is a cubic foot, they're saying that each of these little boxes, each of these cubes here, is exactly a one foot by one foot by one foot cube. We're in three dimensions right now. And we're talking about three dimensions. 3D, you literally need three dimensions. You need how tall you are, how wide you are, and how deep you are. And for a cubic foot, each of those dimensions is one. So each of these are one cubic foot. The entire shape has one, two, three, four, five, six cubic feet in it. So the volume of this entire box is six cubic feet. And you see right here, the unit has feet. And it has a superscript here of three. This is feet to the third power. You could use this as feet times feet times feet, or cubic feet. So this is six cubic feet. Let's do a few more of these. What is the volume of this shape? So this one is quite interesting right over here. Let's see if we can count these. So you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight unit boxes. So I guess these are cubic inches for this example. So we have eight cubic inches. This is a lot of fun, especially when we get to rotate it. So here, each cube is a cubic foot again. So we have one, two, three cubic feet. Three cubic feet. Let's do one more of these. I like the ones that have these kind of crazy shapes that we have to rotate to be able to see all the boxes. So each of these is a cubic meter, which means that in each dimension, each of these boxes is a one by one by one meter. But how many boxes are there? Let's see. We have one. We have one. Let me see. Get a view where I can look at it better. We have one, two, three, four, five, six boxes. So the total volume here is six cubic meters.
