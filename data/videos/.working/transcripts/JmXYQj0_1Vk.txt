Before we go into how China is pegging its currency, let's think about how trade imbalances can get resolved if currencies are allowed to float. For simplicity, let's assume that the current exchange rate is 6 Chinese yuan per 1 US dollar. And also for simplicity, let's assume that China is only exporting one product to the United States, and that is microwaves, and the United States is only exporting one product to China, and that is software. And at the prevailing exchange rate, there is a demand in the United States for 1 million microwaves, 1 million microwaves at $50 each. This is what the Chinese manufacturer can afford to sell his microwaves for in dollars at this exchange rate. Now the US software manufacturer can sell 2 million units of his software at 60 yuan each, at 60 Chinese yuan. So first let's just think about how much revenue each one is getting, and we'll do it in dollars. We could have done it in yuan. The Chinese microwave manufacturer is going to sell a million units at $50 each, or 50 million in revenue. And he is, of course, going to want to convert that into Chinese yuan, because he has to pay his costs in yuan. So he needs to convert that into 50, and he assumes a prevailing exchange rate, so 6 yuan per dollar. So 50 times 6 is 300 Chinese yuan in revenue. The US manufacturer, he's getting 2 million times 60 yuan in revenue, so that is 120 million yuan in revenue. And he wants to convert that to dollars, because that's where his costs are. So he wants to convert that. There's 6 yuan per dollar at the current exchange rate. So 120 divided by 6 would be 20 million US dollars. Now clearly there's a trade imbalance if you look at it from either a dollar point of view or a wen point of view. From a dollar point of view, the Chinese manufacturer is selling $50 million worth of stuff, while the Chinese are only importing $20 million worth of stuff. But let's think about what would happen to the exchange rate. Remember, these are the only people trading. These are the only people who are going to trade goods or currency. What's the supply and the demand for dollars? The supply for dollars is the Chinese manufacturer who wants to convert his $50 million into yuan. So this right here is the supply. What is the demand for dollars? Well, the only guy that wants dollars in this situation right over here is the US manufacturer. He has demand for $20 million. Now this is, I guess, economics 101. If the supply of something is much greater than the demand for something, what's going to happen? The price of the dollar in terms of wen is going to go down. The dollar price will go down. And what that means is, instead of having six wen per dollar, we might have five wen per dollar or four wen per dollar. What's that going to do to the trade imbalance? Now all of a sudden, the Chinese manufacturer has to raise the price on the microwaves, because he's getting less wen per dollar. He needs to cover his costs. But if he raises the price, he's going to reduce the demand. He's going to sell fewer microwaves. The American software producer, he can actually lower the price in wen on his dollar, because he's getting more dollars per wen to cover his costs. So he could lower the price here and get the same number of dollars. But if he lowers the price, he's actually going to up the demand. So you can see in a floating exchange rate, whenever you have a trade imbalance, the country that's shipping more, that has net exports, net positive exports, their currency will get stronger, while the other currency will get weaker. And that'll keep happening until the trade imbalance resolves itself.
