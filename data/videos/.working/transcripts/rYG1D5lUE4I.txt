In your mathematical careers, you might encounter people who say it is wrong to say that i is equal to the principal square root of negative 1. And if you ask them, why is this wrong, they'll show up with this kind of line of logic that actually seems pretty reasonable. They will tell you that, okay, well, let's just start with negative 1. We know from definition that negative 1 is equal to i times i. Everything seems pretty straightforward right now. And then they'll say, well, look, if you take this, if you assume this part right here, then we can replace each of these i's with the square root of negative 1. And they'd be right. So then this would be the same thing as the square root of negative 1 times the square root of negative 1. And then they would tell you that, hey, look, just from straight up properties of the principal square root function, they'll tell you that the square root of a times b is the same thing as the principal square root of a times the principal square root of b. And so, if you have the principal square root of a times the principal square root of b, that's the same thing as the square root of a times b. So based on this property of the radical, of the principal root, of the principal root, they'll say that this over here is the same thing as the square root of negative one times negative one. If I have the principal root of the product of two things, that's the same thing as the product of each of their principal roots. I'm doing this in the other order here. Here I had the principal root of the products, over here I have this on the right. And then from that, we all know that negative one times negative one is one, so this should be equal to the principal square root of one. And then the principal square root of one, remember this radical means principal square root, positive square root, that is just going to be positive one. And they'll say this is wrong, clearly negative one and positive one are not the same thing. And they'll argue, therefore you can't make this substitution that we did in this step. And what you should then point out is that this was not the incorrect step. That it is true, negative one is not equal to one, but the faulty line of reasoning here was in using this property when both A and B are negative. If both A and B are negative, this will never be true. So A and B both cannot be true. Both cannot be negative. In fact, normally when this property is given, sometimes it's given a little bit in the footnotes or you might not even notice it, because it's not relevant when you're learning it the first time, but they'll usually give a little bit of a constraint there. They'll usually say for A and B greater than or equal to zero. So that's where they list this property. This is true for A and B greater than or equal to zero. And in particular, it's false if both A and B are both, if they are both negative. Now, I've said that, I've just spent the last three minutes saying that people who tell you that this is wrong are wrong. But with that said, I will say that you have to be a little bit careful about it. You have to be a little bit careful about it. When we take traditional principal square roots, so when you take the principal square root of four, we know that this is positive two. That four actually has two square roots. There's negative two is also a square root of, also is a square root of four. If you have negative two times negative two, it's also equal to four. This radical symbol here means principal square root. Or when we're just dealing with real numbers, non-imaginary, non-complex numbers, you can really view it as the positive square root. This has two square roots, positive and negative two. If you have this radical symbol right here, principal square roots, it means the positive square root of two. When you start thinking about taking square roots of negative numbers, or even in the future we'll do imaginary numbers and complex numbers and all the rest, you have to expand the definition of what this radical means. When you are taking the square root really of any negative number, you're really saying that this is no longer the traditional principal square root function. You're now talking that this is the principal complex square root function. Or this is now defined for complex inputs or the domain, and can also generate imaginary or complex outputs, or I guess you could call that the range. If you assume that, then really straight from this you get that the square root of negative x is going to be equal to i times the square root of x. This is only, and I'm gonna make this clear because I just told you that this will be false if both a and b are negative. This is only true, so we can apply this, we can apply this, we can apply when x is greater than or equal to zero. So if x is greater than or equal to zero, then negative x is clearly a negative number, or I guess it could also be zero. It's a negative number, and then we can apply this right over here. If x was less than zero, then we would be doing all of this nonsense up here, and then we would start to get nonsensical answers. And if you look at it this way, and you say, look, I can be the square root of negative one if it's a principal branch of the complex square root function, then you could rewrite this right over here as the square root of negative one times the square root of x. And so really, the real fault in this logic, why when people say, hey, one negative one can't be equal to one, the real fault is using this property when both a and b where both of these are negative numbers. That will come up with something that is unambiguously false. If you expand your definition of the complex, or expand your definition of the principal root to include negative numbers in the domain, and to include imaginary numbers, then you can do this. You can say the square root of negative x is the square root of negative one times, or you should say the principal square root of negative x, I should be particular with my words, is the same thing as the principal square root of negative one times the principal square root of x when x is greater than or equal to zero. And I don't want to confuse you. If x is greater than or equal to zero, this is clearly, this negative x, that is clearly a negative, or I guess you should say, a non-positive number.
