I thank everyone for coming. I think we should turn the speaker series into people who really don't need an introduction speaker series, but I will give a brief introduction regardless. This is Tom Friedman, a famous writer, three Pulitzer Prizes, New York Times columnist. Many of you all might not have realized that we know each other and that every morning we coordinate our outfits. What are you wearing today? Yeah, no, we're very careful about that. Should we do pink today? Yes, yes. But it's a real honor to have you here. Where I like to start is, I mean a lot of people know you as like the public person, and I do this really for a lot of, frankly, a lot of people who just might be watching Khan Academy, young students or whatever, and I'm always curious how Tom Friedman becomes the Tom Friedman. I mean, what brought you on this path? So it's interesting, I grew up in, I was born in Minnesota, I grew up in St. Louis Park, a small suburb of Minneapolis. I've always thought to be a successful columnist and whether I am or not, someone else can judge, but it's really important to be from somewhere. So it's really important to be grounded in a worldview that you take around the world and you measure against other things you see. And so the thing you have to understand, my column is I'm always looking for Minnesota. So what does that mean? It means I grew up in Minnesota at a particular time when politics really sort of worked. So I graduated from high school in 1971, and that was the year that our governor, Sandy, forgot his last name now, Anderson, was on the cover of Time Magazine holding up a walleye under the, a walleye fish. A walleye fish, yeah, it's a Minnesota fish. Under the headline, Minnesota, the state that works. So I grew up in a totally liberal district, and my whole life, my congressmen were two liberal Republicans, not Democrats. My senators growing up were Walter Mondale, Eugene McCarthy, and Hubert Humphrey. The companies I grew up with were Dayton, Hudson, Target, Honeywell, 3M, who thought it was part of their responsibility to do corporate social responsibility to build the symphony to fund education programs. So it gave me, I now only realize in retrospect, a very powerful sense of that politics is something that can work, that communities can come together. And so when I later went to the Middle East or Beirut or whatever, I carried that with me, and a lot of what I saw was I saw communities falling apart. Somebody else may have said something else. So my life changed in 10th grade. I had a great teacher. And her name was Hattie Steinberg, and she taught journalism in room 313 at St. Louis Park High School. And her class is still the only journalism course I've ever taken. Not because I'm that good, but because she was that good. It's the only one I ever needed. And she really inspired me to want to be a journalist and a writer. And in that same year, my parents took me to Israel on a trip to visit my sister who's going to school there. I had never been out of the state of Minnesota. I was 15, except for a few brief forays into Wisconsin, and I had never been on an airplane. And so that was my first trip. I came to the Middle East, came to Israel, and I was just kind of blown away. So I actually lived on a kibbutz all three summers of high school. I got totally fascinated with the Middle East, dropped everything, and was just totally absorbed with journalism and the Middle East. And I then went to college. I started taking Arabic as a freshman. I eventually did a semester at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a semester at the American University in Cairo. And I graduated in 1975 from Brandeis, ultimately, in Middle East Studies. And I had a Marshall scholarship to study Arabic and Middle East history, ultimately, in England. I did my first year at the School of Oriental and African Studies, and I went to Oxford and sort of had a classic British-Arabist education at St. Antony's. But while I was in London, I met my then-girlfriend-now-wife, Anne Buxwell, who was a Stanford graduate, who had graduated a year early. And she told her dad, you owe me a year of college. So she decided to go to the LSE for a year. And we met through mutual friends in London. And my real journalism career started because this was 1975. And we were walking down the street in London. And the Evening Standard news stand, they always have that blaring headline, you know, Brad to Jen, we're finished, you know, by the evening paper. And we were walking down the street in London, and I saw the headline on the Evening Standard. And it said, Carter to Jews, Colin, if elected, I promised to fire Dr. K. And I stopped and looked at that. And I said to my then-girlfriend-now-wife, isn't that interesting? This guy is running for president, Jimmy Carter. He's trying to win Jewish folks by promising to fire Henry Kissinger, the first ever Jewish secretary of state. So how could that be? And that's sort of how my mind works. And I have no idea what possessed me. But I went back to my dorm and I wrote a column about it. And my then-girlfriend-now-wife really liked it. And she is from Des Moines, Iowa. She took it home on spring or winter break, I don't remember now, and gave it to a family friend named Gilbert Cranberg, who is the editorial page editor of the Des Moines Register, that wonderful Midwest paper at that time. And he liked it. And he printed it on their op-ed page, half the op-ed page, under an outh cartoon. And they paid... Outh cartoon? Outh cartoonist. Oh, yeah. I thought outh. Under an outh cartoon. It was a wrong time frame. Yeah. And they paid me $50. Wow. And I thought that was the coolest thing in the whole world. I was walking down the street. I had an opinion. I went and wrote it. I gave it to someone, and they paid me $50. People pay for this. And I just thought I was hooked ever after. So during my time at Oxford, I wrote op-ed columns about the Middle East for the Minneapolis Star and Trivie in my hometown paper, where I also knew the editorial page editor, and for my wife's then-girlfriend-wife's hometown paper. So I graduated from Oxford in 1978, and I had a wonderful time there. I studied with Albert Horani, a great Arab historian, and a wonderful man. So I went to apply for a job. And I decided I was applying. A friend of mine, I applied at AP once in London. So I applied for a job at the Associated Press and United Press International in London. And the AP said, you've never covered a fire. You've never covered a city hall meeting. But I had a dozen op-ed columns from the Middle East. And UPI, kind of being AVIS and AP being Hertz, said, look, the kids never covered a fire. But if you could do this, we could probably teach them that. And there's just been a revolution in Iran. And I think they use the same kind of letters as they do in the Arab world. And a bunch of squiggles. And if you knew the Arabic stuff, maybe we could teach them to do that. And so they hired me for $200 a week on Fleet Street. And I worked there for almost a year when the number two man in the Beirut Bureau of UPI got shot in the ear by a man robbing a jewelry store on Humber Street. And he called the headquarters and said, I want to get out of here. I do not want to pass go. I do not want to collect $200. Get me out of here. Where was this? This was in Beirut. In Beirut. Civil War started. He got shot in the ear. In the ear by a man robbing a jewelry store. And so the UPI came to me and said, do you want to go to Beirut? And you are like 20. I'm 25. 25 years old. And I've never been to Beirut. I've been to Egypt. Never been to Beirut. So I turned to my then wife. There's a Civil War going on. Civil War. Civil War. Just started in 75. So this was now as well into its third year. This was 79. Fourth year actually. We just said this is our moment. And got to go. And she signed up. And so we went off to Beirut. And my first night there at the Commodore Hotel, I heard a gunshot fired. That was the first time I ever heard a gunshot in my life. You didn't hear a lot of those in Salem's Park. So we were in Beirut for two years. Civil War had a very profound experience. A searing experience on me. Because what is, and I don't mean this in a voyeuristic way, but when you're in one of those situations, you see how molecules behave at very high temperatures. So what you see is what people are capable of for both good and ill. For good and evil. In a way you'll never see in any normal environment. So the whole color spectrum goes out to here. And you learn an enormous amount about people and about yourself. So I did that for two years. And then the New York Times hired me. Went back to New York for about 11 months as their correspondent. Sorry, as a business correspondent covering oil. And then they sent me back to Beirut in April 1982. I realize that date doesn't mean anything to anyone in this room. They weren't born then. But Israel invaded Lebanon six weeks later. And the Lebanon story became the biggest story in the world. And so I covered the Israeli invasion, the Marines coming, the Marines going, the US embassy bombing, Sabran Chitela, the massacres. All the journalists, I covered the Hama massacre in Syria, which was the precursor to what's going on now. And maybe the most important experience of that, because we're just at the 20th anniversary, sorry, 30th anniversary of the US embassy bombing. And it's quite important. And it's doubly important for what I'll share with you. So on, I think it was April 18th, you can check the date, 1983. I was sitting in my apartment in Beirut, in West Beirut. And I had a little transistor radio on my desk. That was something that was used back then in the Dark Ages, to actually listen to the BBC. That's how I got my news. And there was a blast so powerful that it actually knocked the radio off my desk, like an earthquake almost. And so I did what journalists do back then. I just ran down to the street to do two things. One is, the Israelis set off a lot of sonic booms by supersonic jets over Beirut. So a sonic boom sounds a lot like a car bomb or anything. You don't know the, and so the first thing you listen for are sirens. If it's a sonic boom, you won't hear sirens. If you're sirens, it's bad. And I quickly saw a mushroom cloud curling up in the distance, and a big one. And so I just ran toward it. And that's what we do. You know what I mean? So, and I got closer and closer and said, and it couldn't be. It could, no, it could. And I sort of rounded the turn at the American University in Beirut, and there was the US Embassy, which I used to live across the street from. Cut in half like a doll's house. Bodies hanging out, you know, papers, desks, a smoldering smoking ruin. And staggering around was a young political officer named Ryan Crocker, who she spoke to today because Ryan later became ambassador to Beirut, to Syria, to Afghanistan, and Iraq. And I don't remember if it was him or someone else, but I said, what happened? And they said a man drove a truck. You remember, US Embassy in those days had no perimeter. Wow. You just walked up to the front door. A man drove a truck through the driveway, up the front stairs, into the lobby, and blew it up. And I'll never forget what I said. You mean he blew himself up? Yeah. You mean he committed suicide? Right, that was unheard of. That was, I mean, I literally, I could not get my mind around it. And that was the beginning. That was the first one. And that's really where the phenomena started. So anyways, I did two more years in Beirut for the New York Times. It was remarkable, remarkable in the sense of just see the human drama that played out. I have about eight million questions in my brain. But I mean, especially when you hear about war correspondence, people who are in these war zones, I mean, did you, I mean, and your wife's there with you? Did you fear for your life? I mean, you could go back to wherever, New York, Minneapolis, hang out at the Target, whatever. That's right, Wall of America, wasn't built then. Right. So there were times that, I came to Beirut in April 1982. The war started in June. And unfortunately, in the first week of the war, massive number of refugees came up from the south, mostly Palestinian. My driver in Beirut was a Palestinian. And he worked for the time since the 50s. Actually, he was a driver for Kim Philby. I mean, Mohammed had seen like it all. And he began to fear for my safety because refugees were taking over apartments, any vacant apartment. And this was summer. So a lot of Beirutis had gone to, you know, a lot of people just left out. Break in, empty apartment, move in. Yeah. And so he chose, he decided to move his wife and two daughters into my apartment and move me into the hotel. He thought it would be much safer for me. And tragically, two groups of refugees got in a fight over my building and the one that lost blew it up. Wow. And so the building was completely destroyed. And unfortunately, my driver's wife and two daughters were killed in my apartment. My God. And that was in the first week of the war. And so, you know, that was obviously, I could have been there. My wife hadn't come over yet. You know, I really, you know, people always ask you that. And I honestly don't think about it. I remember once being out to interview Arifat when his raiders bombed the neighborhood. And I just remember that when a big concussion bomb hits, how it sucked all the oxygen out of the air. I was once walking around Beirut airport with the Marines when a ricochet came over our heads. And when a ricochet, cuz a ricochet slows down a bullet, you can actually hear it turning when it gets closer to you. So I remember those kind of things. But most of the time I tried to be prudent. People said, you have a bulletproof vest. And my motto is, if you need a bulletproof vest, you're somewhere you shouldn't be. Because there's no sense in getting yourself killed. So I tried to be as prudent as I could. I still did some crazy ass things. But I used to walk home at night after work at 11, which I still can't believe. And I wrote about this. I wrote a book ultimately about Beirut to Jerusalem. And there was a time where I was walking home at night with my wife. I bought that as a teenager. Really? That's great. Yeah, no. After a movie and we were walking down the streets of Beirut, and a man jumped out a window with a pistol in his hand. And literally landed right in front of us. And I used to say Beirut was so dangerous at night you could walk home, cuz even the criminals were afraid to be out. But he looked at us, and we looked at him. Yeah. And he just went away. And I mean, it's all like, oh my god. It was always like Batman jumped out. But basically, we tried to be prudent. We obviously saw some many tragic scenes. That kid from St. Louis Park never had to help dig his driver's wife and two daughters out of the rubble of an apartment. So it was a searing experience for me. And you hold a lot of stuff in, cuz I was there for the New York Times. It was my first assignment for the Times. The city was under siege. They couldn't get more reporters in, so they were stuck with me. But at the end of the summer, my deal with the Times was that, I'm gonna stay here. I was in the south when Israel invaded. And I'm gonna stay here till the PLO leaves. That was the negotiation, the PLO's gonna leave, whatnot. And cuz I wanted, in your career at the New York Times, if you write one six column headline story for the New York Times, that's a big deal. Right. I probably ate eight that summer. These were, and I wanted to have Israel invades and war ends. You know what I mean? I was just, I was gonna stick it out. So the day finally came that the PLO left, and I always give this as a lesson to young journalists. It was a Saturday. I went down to the port to watch them go in trucks, get on these boats to Greece and Tunisia and whatnot. And I actually was with Peter Jennings, the late Peter Jennings from ABC. And I remember cuz we were standing there. The Palestinians were all shooting in the air, and we were covered in shell cases. Just one of my searing memories. But it was an amazing scene, and it'd been there all summer, and it's just the culmination of the whole thing. And I went back to the Reuters Bureau, where I worked. Just one of those noisy old time newsrooms, which I love. By the way, those days you worked on something. It was called a typewriter, okay? And so I worked on an Adler. I was so proud I had a German typewriter. Actually got blown up, but I got another one. And I'm in the Reuters Bureau, working on my typewriter. The way you wrote stories back then, the way you wrote your news story, you had to write it three paragraphs at a time, hand it to a telex operator. They punched it into telex tape, and then it was telex to the New York Times. Came out as telex tape, and they fed it into a computer, and then that was edited, that's how it all worked. Try writing a story, three paragraphs at a time. So you have to write the whole thing through, cuz you gotta know where you're going, then write it through again, and then you kinda write it through and hand it in. So it's Saturday, it's about three o'clock, I'm doing this, I'm writing. This is my lesson, it's a culmination of the whole summer. And all the communications from Beirut to the west of the world went down. Somebody basically either unplugged the PTT, cuz they all went through one PTT line, post-telecrona telegraph, and no cell phones then, no nothing. So the entire communications between Beirut and the rest of the world were cut down. I still today have the telex tape in a shoebox of my last story from Lebanon. I stayed by the telex all night to see if it would come on, it never did. And that Sunday morning under a six column headline said, Palestinians evacuate Beirut, associated press. And what I always tell young journalists about that is that it's really my view of life, which is that it's all about the journey, not about the destination. I love the movie Moneyball, because you just gotta enjoy the show. And sometimes you don't have the headline, you don't have the thing, but I don't mean enjoy a war, but you know what I'm saying? You just gotta- It's a real experience, you're living it. You just gotta be satisfied by the experience, cuz sometimes the PTT goes down. And you never had an experience like that gentleman who got his ear shot, where you're just like, I've got enough, I'm getting out of here. No, you know, I never, you know, you do get, I'm not some super guy, you do get hardened to it though, you try to be prudent. I mean, Beirut to Jerusalem, I talked about a scene where I was with a colleague who they did get into Beirut at one point, and he was very jittery and nervous about the whole thing. And at one point I was working on my story on Deadline, and we're at the Reuters Bureau, and there was a man shooting at another person in the park across the street, and he came over to me and said, did you see that guy there? He had the gun in his gut, and he was shooting at him like this. And I just looked up, I said, Bill, was he shooting at you? Okay, all right. Mind your own business. Because if he wasn't shooting at you, I am on Deadline, okay? And I don't mean, obviously it was not like, but you're just really focused about what you do, you know? And I tried, I was not, people did much crazier things than me, I just did not, you know, I tried to take care of myself and obviously you're in a dangerous situation, just by being in Beirut, you're in a dangerous situation. But, you know, I'll tell you, Sal, the people I went through that with, I go back to Lebanon pretty much once a year still. Because they are among my closest and dearest friends, because we were all on the Titanic together. You know, and the friends I have who I went through Beirut with are like no friends I have. There's another story from Beirut to Jerusalem that I love to tell, because we had our local reporter there in New York Times, a guy named Hassan Hijazi, a brilliant Palestinian reporter and a real teacher of mine. And he tells a story in the book, because Israelis were bombing Beirut all the time then, and one point they were in their living room, you know, just waiting for the bombing to end, and with a candle going on, and a mouse appeared. And it was like he and his wife were up on the couch, you know what I mean? Like fear, you can be afraid of funny things, you know what I mean? Like the bombing is coming, they can be obliterated any moment, but that mouse scared the daylights out of him, you know? And so you get just really funny things like, you don't have experiences like that anywhere else, where you learn so much about human nature. And so I was there for over the course of five years, I was there for four full years, so I went back for the New York Times, and the Times said, hey, do you want to go to Jerusalem? So the New York Times had never had a Jewish reporter in Israel. It was a rule of the paper. And they tried to change that rule with my predecessor, David Schipler, but they discovered after they appointed him that he just looked Jewish, but he wasn't actually Jewish, okay? And so they didn't make that mistake with me, and they said, you've already done Beirut, not do Jerusalem. And no one ever done that before, so I thought that'd be kind of interesting. So I did that for five years. And that was a very different experience. The boundaries, you know, were much narrower, you know, the color spectrums you didn't have. And I did that, and then I took a year off. I wrote from Beirut to Jerusalem. Then I, when I got back to Washington, they said, whoever becomes the next president, you will be the chief diplomatic correspondent. So it turned out to be George Bush, the elder. He named Jim Baker Secretary of State. And so after my year off writing this book, I became the chief diplomatic correspondent and traveled with- You should have been like Secretary of State yourself. No, hardly. Actually, not only should I, it's not Paul's modesty in the least. I didn't know anything about anything other than the Middle East. So I got a great education traveling with Baker. First nine months was really boring. And I'm thinking, I gave up covering a drama to covering a policy. And I gave up covering a street to covering a hall. Like, what did you do? And then this wall in Berlin came down. Yeah, I heard about that. And suddenly, I found myself traveling 750,000 miles with Baker with a front row seat to the end of the Cold War. You were like in the plane. He takes 10 reporters with him. And it was just an amazing front row seat to the end of the Cold War. So I felt like I was really lucky twice. Because in this business, if you're in the right place at the right time, one time, like you're lucky and I thought this was really lucky. So I did that for four years, great education. Then I just very quickly, I was chief White House correspondent for the first year of Bill Clinton. And that was Mr. Toad's wild ride. I have to tell you. Mr. Toad's wild ride. That was such a crazy ass experience, I gotta tell you. What was the craziest thing that you saw? I don't know, just the Clinton White House was just, they were fun and he was fun. And it was, thank God, it was the end of the Cold War, so it wasn't a serious time. No, yeah. So, nobody got hurt. And this is just the stuff that you saw. That's right. I mean, you're like a friend. It was like, but I did that for a year. And covering the White House, it's an experience every journalist should have, because it's a very interesting experience. But none dare call it journalism. It's a cross between babysitting and stenography, because you're there, but you gotta go everywhere with the president. Who are you babysitting? You're babysitting the president, because you go wherever he goes, like a ball and chain. But you take turns flying in Air Force One, because it's a pool. So I'm glad I did it for a year, but I got the point after a year and said, I don't really wanna do this. Because one of the things about covering the White House and the State Department is back in those days, again, the prehistoric days. The Washington Post and New York Times exchange front pages at 1030 every evening. So we saw what they had, and they saw what we had. Really? And it was a little- Mafia bosses getting together. Mafia's restrained of trade, people don't realize. And if you're sitting at home, when you're covering the White House or the State Department, there's just one thing you don't want, a phone call at 1035, okay? Cuz when the phone rings at 1035, you are only bad things are gonna happen. The Washington Post is doing the same story. No, the editor says the Washington Post has a front page story that Jim Baker is about to announce this, and you have to start to match it at 1035 at night. You haven't lived till you've called a senior administration official at home at 1035 at night, okay, to match a Washington Post story. And so not only are you up till midnight matching their story, but you know when you come into the office the next morning, everyone knows they've got the lead story that you missed, okay? So anyways, that's just part of the prehistoric age, basically. No Twitter then. So they would coordinate not to be embarrassed. Exactly. That's why they showed a chance. We would give each other a chance to match each other's story. But with the codicil that it said, as reported in the Washington Post first, so you had to kind of eat that crow before you matched it. So then they transferred me to be the chief economics correspondent, the Treasury Department. And this is now early 90s, Netscape's just been invented. This thing called the Internet. Remember when Bill Clinton was president, elected president, no one had e-mail, okay? No one had heard of e-mail. And this thing called globalization was a warning. And so I was at the Treasury Department, just as we were kind of shifting from general power to general electorate, in terms of our kind of concerns. You have a knack for words. Yeah, I don't know where it comes from. They tell me that. You should put that towards you. Right. And so I did that for three years, and then they made me the foreign affairs columnist. And I've been doing that ever since, and then I came here yesterday. You came here yesterday. And I think this is destiny, because you talk about these life moments, one, discovering the op-ed, how you could communicate, and then all of these other experiences. There's this form factor called the YouTube video, which I think some organizations could get you making some videos about. Absolutely. I know I should do that. And I thought of doing a MOOC. It's funny. So my youngest daughter went to Williams College, and Williams is on a 414 system. And this is relevant now for Khan Academy, I think, which is that. So the one is a winter term, which is kind of fun. So you take wine making, trip to Morocco. But as a freshman, you have to stay on campus. So in a shameless effort to be near my daughter, I agreed. I had a friend there who was teaching a course on teaching, actually. I agreed to teach a course on how to write a column. And it was really fun for one reason. I realized that I've learned about globalization and written about it. I've learned about the Middle East. I've written about it. But I know how to write a column. And it was really fun to write about something you know really deeply, and to teach it. So the way the course was constructed, I created a little book for the class. Because I did a team taught it with a friend of mine who was an educator. So you had to teach a lesson on Tuesday. And then you had to write a column off that lesson on Thursday. And I would come to class. And they would email their columns ahead of time. And then I would deconstruct them in front of them. The 18th graph is really the lead. The lead is really the kicker. And I showed them. I kind of take it apart for them. So what I did, though, was I created a seven chapter book, I guess, on how to write a column. I just did this mimeograph. Because my view is that there's actually just six kind of columns. And if you write a column that gets any one of these six reactions, you have a column. And then I give examples of all six. And the last chapter was Tom Friedman is a big fat idiot, right wing, pinko, left wing, bottom dwelling slug. I took a days or weeks blogs about me. And I put them all in one chapter about what a flaming jerk I am. And just to explain to people that being a columnist is not a friend growth industry. That you want my life, are you ready for chapter seven? Because you're ready to be ready for chapter seven. Because I live with that Greek chorus every day. So the six kind of columns are. So if you write a column that proves one of these six reactions, you got a column. The first is someone reads it and says, I didn't know that. That's a column. You tell people something they didn't know from reporting. You report something. Wow, I didn't know that. Second is, I never looked at it that way. You give people a new perspective. I never looked at it that way. Third, your favorite, you live for this. Happens half a dozen times a year if you're lucky. You said exactly what I felt. But I didn't know how to say, God bless you. God bless you. Thank you so much. The fourth is, I want to kill you dead, you and all your offspring. Because your column is defined as much by people who are against it. And you had people actually write that to you? Oh, yeah. That's nothing. I mean, that's nothing nice stuff. I'd like to dance on your grave. Really? People have written that? Oh, you get everything. But you really need to. If you don't take chances, if you don't, you know, so you've got to take people on and be taken on. The fifth, very hard, do not try this trick at home, kids. You made me laugh. You made me cry. Very hard to do. When you do it well, oh, wow, it really works. When you do it badly, bad humor or bad sort of sentimentality is cringe inducing. So don't try that one unless you're really going to pull it off. And less is what I simply call, you challenged me. And that is when a columnist challenges his own readers, which I believe in doing. I do a lot of that. And so to me, if you write, and I give examples of all six. So if you write one of those kind of six columns, you've got a column. And you target one, or do you just go around and think about what you want to write? You write it, and then you say, oh, that's category three with a little bit of four. No, I'm not thinking about it now. I mean, because I know. So intuitively, I know what it is. So right now, I've got actually three columns wrestling in my head. Before I came here, I tracked on Ambassador Ryan Crocker and a plane in LaGuardia after I talked to you. Because I had a thought about Syria that was triggered by something he wrote in the Washington Post this morning. I'm thinking about some of the things you said, because it melds well with a McKinsey study that somebody sent me yesterday. And I did a column with a bunch of health care innovators last week at HHS. I did research for it. So I got that in my head. Sometime tomorrow, I'll make a commitment for Sunday. But right now, all three are wrestling. And I'm carrying all three around in my head. To be a columnist, you have to, I see columns everywhere. Like I do, it's an hour here. And I could easily get a column or two out of this. And if I didn't, you'd kind of die, because I do this twice a week. It's like, what am I going to write for Wednesday? And it was Sundays. I have no idea what I'm going to write for Sunday. I really don't have any idea. All I know is I've got a four-hour plane ride on Friday. And I will write whatever I'm going to write for Sunday on that four-hour plane ride. I will make a commitment then. So I never worry about the ideas. It's more which one to choose of the ideas I have. So we will try to convince you to get your course on Khan Academy. Yeah, I would love to. I've really thought about doing a MOOC or something for you guys, because it would be fun. Your great grandchildren will learn to write a column. It would be a great honor. Throughout all of this, once again, a million different things. Just going from the first question of how you got started, what's interesting about it is you just started doing your career. And nowhere in that did someone look at your resume and say. No, all I did, they saw that I went to Oxford. I studied Arabic and all. So that was a door opener. But what really got me in was I had a dozen columns to show. So whatever young journalists come to me and say, I want to do what you do, they say, what do I need to do with what you do? And I say, well, the first thing you need is you'll be able to type fast. I can type really fast. Take good notes. You need to know English, obviously, good grammar. That's right. Good grammar. Punctually, the comma goes there. Good to know some economics, politics, history, all those things. Science, environment. But there's actually just one thing to be a good journalist, I believe. You have to like people. You have to really enjoy sitting with them and listening to the crazy things they say and do and the incredible music of their lives. And if you cannot hear the music, you'll never be able to play the music. And I really do like people. I love interviewing them. I interview them wherever I go. And so I'm struck at how many journalists hate people. And I've known several of them. But I really do like people. And I enjoy hearing the music of their lives. I have an unnamed friend who was in residency for surgical residency. And he, really brilliant guy. And he got some negative feedback from one of the senior residents. And the feedback was, it really just doesn't look like you care about the patients. And he was really taking that to heart. And then I asked him, well, do you care? He's like, no. Yeah. That's right. It's like, well, that's right. That's right. It shows. It shows. It shows. I was in San Francisco yesterday. And I went to Starbucks because I needed some free wireless because my wireless was out. So I just was going in there. And a guy came up and said, we have to buy you coffee. Big fans, yada, yada. And so, according to me, he said, well, what do you do? Oh, you're in big data analysis? Fascinating. Give me your card. By 4.30, I met with them again. I bought them a drink and interviewed them. So there's one good thing about notoriety. People throw shit at you. They want to dance on your grave. That's right. They want to dance on your grave. But a lot of other people want to come up and tell you about their lives and what they do. And they are just, I cannot tell you how many columns, stories, and ideas I've gotten from people who just come up to me on the street, in an airport, in a Starbucks, and tell you things about their lives. So I'm really open to that. I'm still tickled when someone comes up to me and says something. I think that's pretty serious. If someone stops you and says, I want to tell you how I feel about what you're doing, you know what I mean? So you invite that. I really welcome that. You see Tom Friedman in an airport. Yeah, people do it. And by the way, a lot of times people come up and say, I agree with about 90% of what you write. And I say, hey, that's like perfect number for me, because it means you're always going to check. Death for a columnist is if people say, I know what he or she is going to write. Why should I read it? I don't know what I'm going to write half the time, because my column is very non-ideological and very reporting-centric, because I'm still a reporter. I believe the best columnists are always reporters. And I think it's actually true in every profession, because I always tell you, I've had colleagues that say, I want to do what you do. I only do analysis now, to which I say, your analysis must not be very good, because all my analysis grows out of my reporting. It's only when you're working with the clay that you see the patterns. You feel the texture. And that's where the column comes from. And you find it difficult to kind of maintain ground. You know, say you put on an op-ed and you get a bunch of people on a message board just saying, oh, you're this, that, you're this, that. Does that affect you? Maybe I am wrong. Maybe I do need to move more than I'm right. So it's a really complicated thing. I'm not on Twitter. I'm not on Facebook, because I just be overwhelmed. So the signal-to-noise ratio now is the noise is so high that you can't know human being. People say, I've got a thick skin. It doesn't bother me. I've never met that person. So any time people are in large numbers saying bad things about you, you, by the way, many people say the opposite. I don't want to exaggerate it. But here's what I find kind of about the comments section of the Times, because we have comments under our columns. So today there are maybe 400 comments. And you always have to be careful, because the Times online, which is where people comment, has a little bit of a left bias, who reads the New York Times, then who reads it online. It's going to be a younger, more left-to-center audience. So you've got to be aware of that for starters. But very often I confess I go to the closet. I put on my wetsuit. I fix the helmet to my head. And I dive into the comments, because you find a lot. They're predictable. You're this, you're that. They're nasty. They're personal. Whatever. But I'll tell you, invariably when I do it, I come across one, two, or three that are brilliant. And I literally cut and paste them in my notebook and say, I've got to remember this. And that's the beauty of crowdsourcing. So it just comes with the territory. By the way, you're out there dishing it out. You've got to be able to take it. So I'm a big believer in that. So I'm not in the internet wars. You'll never see me fighting. Because my attitude is, I got my say, you got your say. And I'm not going to prove you're right. 10 years ago I wrote The World is Flat. So since then, people have written books. The world is not flat. There's a library. The world is curved. The world is spiky, lumpy, chunky. And people, I said, what did you say about that book? And my attitude is to everybody. And this isn't arrogant. Look, I'm either going to be right or wrong. But we're not going to know for 10 years. So come to me in 10 years. And I'd say 10 years later, I got one big thing wrong. It is so much flatter than I thought. And this place is surfing on that. What happened? So actually, you were just saying, right before we were chatting about this, your most recent op-ed piece. Tell us about it. Because I think that does start to connect with what we're trying to do here. Yeah, I think what really can I start at just one 10,000 foot layer higher, because I really like to think of what I do as being a plumber, that I'm always interested in where the plumbing is. So I spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley. And I always have. Because I'm very interested in where the technology is going, what it's enabling, what it's empowering, and what it's not. And so that's really what produced the world is flat. So I mean, may I just tell that story just for a second, because it's relevant. So after 9-11, I spent three years in the Arab Muslim world trying to understand the roots of 9-11. And I wrote from Beirut to Jerusalem. Then 10 years later, I wrote one of the first big books about globalization called The Lexus and the Olive Tree. That came out late 90s. And then I put that subject down after 9-11 and really focused on trying to understand the roots of 9-11. I also started doing documentaries then for the Discovery Channel. So Discovery Channel and New York Times created a partnership. I did a documentary after 9-11 called The Roots of 9-11, which I was very proud of. And I did one then on The Wall, Israel was built in the West Bank. And in February 2004, we were sitting around with our Discovery team. What should we do our next documentary on? And Kerry was running against Bush for president. And at the time, my idea was let's do a documentary about why everybody hates America. Thought that was a hot subject. Bush was president, running for reelection. Why does everybody hate us? And so how should we do that? I had this crazy idea we should go to outsourcing centers all over the world and interview young people who spend their days imitating Americans on what they think of America. I thought it'd make a fascinating double mirror. You know, Shao by day, John by night, Juan by day, Joe by night. And so we literally were budgeting that documentary. Where do we go? Guatemala, Mexico City, Philippines, Bangalore. And in the middle of that budget debate, John Kerry came out with his blast against Benedict Arnold CEOs who engage in outsourcing. Because we just had the Y2K thing. Outsourcing was just becoming a big issue. So I came to the Times. I said, time out. Why don't we do a documentary just called The Other Side of Outsourcing? And explain this phenomena to people. And I know Nand and Nila Khandi at Infosys. And I could go to Bangalore. They're like, that is go ahead. That was the days when people had money. And so we went to Bangalore. And we spent two weeks there. And I had just come up really three years covering 9-11. And I'd written this book on globalization in the late 1990s. And I spent two weeks in Bangalore. And I realized I just kept walking around, so I'm saying, I don't understand the platform that's allowing this. I met people ready to trace my lost luggage on Delta Airlines from Bangalore, read my x-rays from Bangalore, do my taxes from Bangalore. Now, this all seems now normal. But back then, it was mind-blowing. So the last interview was with Nand and Nila Khandi, the CEO of Infosys, Microsoft of India. And he'd been out of the country those two weeks. And he'd just come back. I went to his office at Electronic City in Infosys to see. And we sat on the couch outside his office. I had my laptop on my lap. At one point, he said, Tom, I got to tell you, the global economic playing field is being leveled. And you Americans are not ready. Oh, I wrote that down on my little laptop. The global economic playing field being leveled. You have to be careful when you talk to me. You Americans are not ready. And it just really blew my mind. It connected a lot of things. So I got done with the interview. I got back in my Jeep to go back to my hotel. And it's about an hour drive from Electronic City back to Bangalore. And I'm thinking now the whole time, what Nanda said, the global economic playing field is being leveled. Wow, he's really saying the global economic playing field being flattened. Wow, I think he just told me the world is flat. And so I wrote that in my notebook. The world is flat. I got back to my hotel room. I literally ran up to my room. And I called my wife in Bethesda and said, honey, I'm going to write a book called The World Is Flat. She now says she thought that was a brilliant idea. That is not exactly how I recall the conversation. I'm looking at my wife. We have. Oh, no. But I got so excited about it. It was Nandan's 50th birthday party. I'll never forget this. And I was going back to his house for dinner. He had a Simon and Garfunkel imitation duo. He was so excited about the idea. He had all his Bangalore tech pals. Was he Simon or Garfunkel? He was singing. No, no, no. He had an imitation duo. I'll let that pass. But Nandan was so excited about it, he wanted me to. I literally had sketched out on the back of an envelope kind of the just rough crude outline of a book. And he wanted me to present it at his birthday party to his Bangalore. He was so excited about it. But I got home. I called The Times. I said, I have to go and leave immediately. My software is out of date. I'm a basic engineer, and it's a Java world. And if you don't give me a leave immediately, I'm going to write something really stupid in The New York Times, because my software is a great way to get a leave. So my software was out of date. And so they basically did. They said, go as soon as you can. So I went out and went out and leave in July. And that July, I went to the Allen Conference in Sun Valley. They've invited me a bunch. I just never could work it out to go. And so then I had it really on the back of an envelope, but it was more fleshed out. And they asked me to make a presentation. Bill Gates was in the audience. And he heard it. And he came up afterwards. He had taken all these notes, Bill. And he said, that was really interesting. And I said, you're talking to me? I told you something about this that you didn't know. And he said, oh, no, I knew all of that. I just never put it together. Oh, he was like a class four, or whatever. It was just like he said. Yeah, he said, I never connected all those things. He said, you're 90% there, and I'm going to help you with the last 10%. Well, that's interesting, because at that point, the book came out. Oh, yeah, absolutely. And he's obviously put a huge goal here as well. But that's what the outsourcing craze. People were scared. Everything's going to go to India and China. And it seems like we're kind of that post-fear phase right now. And it's true, a lot of stuff is still going to that part of the world. But if you look at the US, software engineer salaries continue to go through the roof. You look at it. Is everyone's salary going through the roof? Your salaries are going through the roof. They are. They legitimately are. You have more and more innovation is actually being focused in 20 miles around here. We have a great American, Tesla now. I mean, how do we compare these two things? This notion between the US is losing its edge, everything's being outsourced. And it looks like more innovation is being focused in the US now. So let's go to what happened between 2004 and today. Because I think that's the story, that between 2004 and today, something big happened. Call it Flat World 2.0. I call it the great inflection. But there was a merger of globalization and the IT revolution. They kind of merged in a way that more IT drove more globalization, more globalization drove the expansion to more IT. And they merged. And so something really big happened, saw in my view. We went from a connected world to a hyper-connected world. And I believe it's changing everything. And Khan Academy is now on that platform. So the story I tell my soundbite is that when I wrote The World is Flat, so when I wrote my last book, which is about America, which in 2011, the first thing I did was go back and get the first edition of The World is Flat off my bookshelf, just to remind myself what I'd written. And I took it off the shelf. I opened it up to the index, looked under A, B, C, D, E, F, F, A. Facebook wasn't in it. So when I was running around the world, saying the world is flat, we're all connected. Facebook didn't exist. Twitter was still a sound. The cloud was still in the sky. 4G was a parking place. LinkedIn was a prison. Applications were what you sent to college. Big Data was a rap star. And Skype was a typo. I mean, all of that happened after I wrote The World is Flat. So what does that tell you? It tells you we've gone from a connected world to a hyper-connected world. So what are the features of that? Well, the features of that is that more people now can compete, connect, collaborate, and invent with more other people in more different ways, from more different places for less money than ever before. And it reached a difference of degree. That's a difference of kind that allows for Khan Academy. That for basically zero marginal costs, you can now offer the greatest educational lessons to anyone in the world with a web-enabled cell phone or an internet-enabled computer. But what's your sense of why, I mean, like the talent, the offshoring fear, was that all the software engineering jobs are going to go to India. What's your sense of why we actually saw the opposite? Actually, now we're seeing finally an inflection point where software engineers are trying to become competitive with bankers and consultants and other types of people in terms of income. And what do you think is allowing for that despite the globalization phenomenon? Well, the other way I always like to explain it is that there isn't something called a lump of labor. We've got it, and no India's gonna get it, bring the lump back. That's not how it works, okay? So the best way I could at least explain it when I talk about the world is flat is, guess what? Not everything that needs to be invented has been invented. And the example I always give is, your daughter goes off to college. My daughter goes off to college. And your kid goes off to college. Come back after first semester and you say, so honey, what do you think I'm majoring in? What do you think you're gonna do? She says, dad, I wanna be a search engine optimizer when I grow up. Say, I sent you to college, you couldn't be an ophthalmologist or an accountant. What the hell is a search engine optimizer? Of course, so here's an industry that came from zero to multi-billion dollars. How do we optimize my website? So if Sol's in the tennis shoe business and Tom's in the tennis shoe business, when I put tennis shoes into Google, Tom's tennis shoes comes up before Sol's tennis shoes. It is now a multi-billion dollar industry that's a mashup, by the way, between Math and Madison Avenue. So it brings together advertising people with mathematicians. Whole new field for people with software or math degrees never existed before. And so Khan Academy, the software around distributed online courses didn't exist 10 years ago. And so all these things keep getting invented, but there's one constant it seems to me, Sol, and that's every good job is either going out, up, or down faster than ever. That is, every good job either requires more education to do, or it can be done by more people, computers, or software, or it's being outsourced to the past faster. So every job is going in all three directions. Maybe not more education in the formal sense. No, exactly, more competency. Competency, creativity, whatever you might want to do. Exactly. One thing we know about Search Engine Optimizer, you needed to know more than you did to be a computer repair person. But what I think is exciting about this moment, and again, this is all being, I would argue, enabled by the hyper-connected platform, is that once it becomes a competency game, I can acquire those competencies in any way. And that's what people don't appreciate about globalization. I always say globalization giveth and globalization taketh. Globalization just made the qualification for this job higher, and it just brought you Khan Academy, where my daughter, who was applying for graduate school, can go to to get prep for her GREs for free. Well, she did. She did. You told me. Exactly. Hope she got her money's worth. She did. Because money. She got in. She got in. She's there right now. She visited here two weeks ago. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's doing both at the same time. And if you miss that, if you think it's all bad or all good, you don't get it. And so the debate around globalization tends to be that, oh my god, it's terrible. It's going to kill us. It's going to overwhelm us. Or it's wonderful. No, it's disruptive. It's creative destruction on steroids. But the opportunities, it's unleashing for all different kinds of people. And so my overall summary of it is that we're going from a, we're moving into a 401k world where everyone will have to pass the bar exam and no one will be able to escape the most email lists. So versus the pension world. Exactly. So basically, you were going from a world of defined benefits to defined contributions. For 30 years, I worked for the New York Times. I had a defined benefit. Every year, it didn't matter. It was obviously tied to my performance in general. But basically, I got a defined benefit from the New York Times. Now I get a defined contribution. They'll give me X amount of money. And I have to take responsibility for investing it wisely. So I think that's happening to the whole labor market. We're going from a world of defined benefits where you're going to be protected by walls and floors. You go to college or fine. You're going to get a job. Exactly. That four-year degree is a proxy for a key in the door of a job. That's right. No, now we're in a world of defined contributions. The great thing for all the people on Khan Academy is there's no ceiling anymore. It ain't going to matter in five years. Whether you went to Stanford or you got those competencies on Khan Academy, the ceiling's gone. But what's really scary? So are the floors and walls. And so we're going from a defined benefit world to a defined contribution world. That's what the hyper-connectivity does. Second. Real global meritocracy. Oh, absolutely. Anyone will be able to compete. Anyone will be able to compete. Second, it's a world where, and what's will enable that is we're moving to a world where everyone will have to pass the bar. That is, in the old days, we said, your three years at Stanford Law School, or maybe 100 years, we said, going to law school was a proxy for knowing the law. At some point, the legal profession said, no, no. You're going to go to law school. But then you have to take the bar that says you actually know what you know. That is coming, I think, to every industry. You want to get a job across the street at Google? I don't think you just show up this. I have a BA in engineering. No, they test if you actually know what you know. Because Tony Wagner always says, the world doesn't really care what you know. Because the Google machine knows everything. The world only pays off on what you can do with what you know. And we are now going to test that. So my motto is, everyone's going to have to pass the bar. Third, we all are going to have our own most emailed machine. So New York Times, go to newyorktimes.com. Any day, you have the most emailed columns. Changes every 15 minutes. Any journalist who says they don't look at it is lying. You always want to see where your story, your column, whatever did it go up in most emails. It's human nature. I think what's coming is a most emailed list is coming to a job near you. Because with big data. So we had a story in the New York Times that Jamba Juice has technology. It's installed. It's in place where they can measure which employees sell the most juice on Fifth Avenue and 63rd Street at 80 degrees. Between 8 and 10 in the morning. And because they also divide their workday in 15 minute increments, the employees who do that get the most overtime. They've got their most emailed list now. If you go to schoolloop.com in your world, you can track your kid's school assignment. What he, she or she, whether she turned it in on time. By the way, whether he or she is tardy. And the kids now have their most emailed list. So these are all most emailed lists that will connect to your performance and display it in real time. And look, it's all scary. It's scary to me. And as well, I mean, some people would fear that, OK, this is going to become very automatic, very, OK, these things matter. How productive were you with Jamba Juice? But what about the soft skills, the arts even, and the arts impact on society as a whole, participation in democracy, some of these things that don't translate into dollars at Jamba Juice? So I think those are, again, more important than ever. Because what this world really enables, if you are a self-motivated person and you're living in a world of Khan Academy, if you are a self-motivated kid in Khan Afghanistan, and there's Khan Academy and I've got an internet connection, you can suddenly go to the moon. Do you think of the walls and ceilings that person lived within? And so that is just really exciting if you are self-motivated. If you are not self-motivated, the walls and floors that protected you are gone. And so I think the most important kind of leadership for a company and leadership and for teachers and for parents and for coaches is education that inspires. Those soft skills, love of learning, motivation, they are going to matter hugely in a world more than ever. Because when everything is out there now, for you for free, if you access it. And that's sort of one side of the soft skills. But also, it's great to know math and physics and calculus and programming. And you can't be creative without them. But poetry, music, jazz, sports, collaboration, all those things that inspire people to take the math and turn it into something of beauty, something that will make people's lives more productive, more healthy, more entertained, more caring, that all comes from the other stuff. So I think the pendulum swung pretty far to this way in terms of rigorous skill, hard skills. I think we need to make sure we come back to the middle here. And that we're blending. When we say blended model, we don't just mean teacher as a tutor more and a coach and all the online stuff taking care of the rest. But blending also, all these are the things. And if I read between the lines we talk about these new industries, the difference between the engineering jobs that are going to India and the ones that are salaries are increasing here is that it's fundamentally right-brained. It's fundamentally creative. Absolutely. India got into this game by remediating Y2K computers. Now what's cool to me about what's going on in India a decade later is we're seeing. So when I wrote about The World is Flat in 2004, that was really based on India and solving our problems, Y2K. Now it's so exciting with this platform. They're using these incredibly cheap tools of connectivity and collaboration and the cloud to solve their problems. So if you look at what innovators in Mexico or India are doing, it's an explosion of innovation. We've got a billion more brains that potentially can be applied against the biggest problems of humanity. And if that doesn't float your boat, then there's something wrong with you. Now at the same time, I understand the challenge. We should get them to figure out how we can solve the outsourcing problem. Well, they might do that. Don't put it past them. And I understand for a lot of people, it's scary. If you're a 50-year-old guy or gal in a declining industry, and somebody comes and said, no problem. You can thrive. Just go to Khan Academy and take their lessons. I have huge sympathy for that. That's just so out of there. They've been protected by a wall and a floor. They didn't do this. You can use all my tax dollars you want to help those people and make a transition. And what we shouldn't do is block the change. If horses could vote, there never would have been cars. It's always important to remember that. And so if you try to stand in the way of the change. That would be a fun party game. If horses could vote, what would there be? What would else? What would there be and what would there be? I love the way your mind works. Because then you won't have the resources to take care of people. But I have a huge sympathy for people caught in that transition. And no one should ever mistake. I get very excited talking about things I discover. Just connections I make. But do not mistake my excitement for just, I love the puzzle. You know what I mean? Wow, that explains this. And this explains that. And people should know that this is happening. But don't confuse it for unsympathy or even that I'm not even net worried about all of this. That I see the upside and the downside, but it leaves me net worried in many ways. Wow. I'm going to ask you one last question. Where are you going next? You hinted on it a little bit. And I found that fascinating because you're doing two documentaries almost at the same time. Well, it's one day. It's the same documentary. It's called Climate Change in the Arab Spring. It's for the Showtime channel. It's part of a six part climate series they're going to run next year. We're going to Yemen on Sunday to look at Yemen, the first country in the world that will probably run out of water. You can go around Sana. You see water trucks all over the place. Unfortunately, the country has a big addiction to COPT, this plant. To what? COPT? QAT. It's a drug. I mean, it's a plant that is a mild narcotic, but it consumes a lot of water. And somebody told me they were on a high level presidential visit, or the president of their country, the secretary of state of their country. And they went with the president of Yemen somewhere and the pilot of the helicopter was chewing coke. Yes. Kind of leave me a little worried. Get on American Airlines. Yeah. Pilot a pile of cot on the floor. And then we're going to Syria because people don't realize Syria had a 10 year drought, worst drought in their history, round recorded history. As the lead up to this, a million farmers and grazers had to leave the countryside, move to the cities, put huge pressure on the infrastructure. And it didn't cause the revolution there, but it was one of the stresses that really helped contribute to it. And we're going to Egypt because in 2010, in December 2010, there was a huge spike in global wheat prices because there was a drought in Australia, there was a drought in Russia, and there was a drought in China. Flooding in Australia, drought in China, drought in Russia. And as a result, global wheat prices spiked in December 2010, the exact same time of the revolution. Airspring. Airspring. Exactly. Tunisia and Egypt then. Food prices hit a record high the month of the Tunisian revolution. And remember the guy who started the revolution in Tunisia was a fruit seller. He was a vegetable seller. So these didn't cause the Arab Spring, but they were huge stresses on the systole. Accelerated catalysts. And it shows you why you should take climate change very seriously. Well, on that note, fairly epic note, quite positive. But this has been a huge honor, I think, for all of us at the team. Great fun for me. Thank you so much for coming. Real treat. So thank you very much. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
