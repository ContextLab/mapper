What exactly happens when wood burns into a pile of ash? How do scientists make bacteria glow? How does one cell become trillions of specialized cells? And what causes the most destructive spinning storms on earth? Welcome to Khan Academy Science. Whether you're a teacher or a learner, we help bring these and many more big ideas of biology, physics, chemistry, and earth and space science to life. All for free. Here's what's in store. We have NGSS and TEEX-aligned courses for middle and high school science, along with several AP courses. Our science courses use videos and articles to bring concepts to life with everyday examples and real-world phenomena. Each one targets specific learning objectives, making even the most complex topics clear and accessible. You'll also find interactive practice exercises that give learners immediate feedback. They cover both conceptual problems that test understanding and applied practice that builds mastery. At Khan Academy, we know science is best learned by doing. That's why we've built interactive, hands-on experiences for your classroom. Our middle and high school investigative activities are low-prep, use simple materials, and are rooted in real-world contexts. They incorporate key science practices and themes, inviting students to build models, plan investigations, analyze data, and explain their findings, just like professional scientists and engineers. Each activity includes both a student guide and a teacher guide for smooth implementation. We've also integrated simulations directly into our courses. These let students explore complex ideas, adjust variables, and see results in real time, deepening their understanding of core science concepts. Now, as a teacher, you get powerful tools to guide your class. Create a free account, choose a course, and assign exactly what your students need. The teacher dashboards show who's stuck, who's ready to move, and lets you track progress by student, by skill, or by standard, so you can tailor the learning journey to your class. Every month, more than 10 million learners and teachers use Khan Academy. Whether your goal is to differentiate instruction or prepare for an AP exam, Khan Academy offers rigorous, engaging, and completely free resources to help students master their core science skills. So, join us in helping every learner think, question, and explore the universe with Khan Academy Science.
