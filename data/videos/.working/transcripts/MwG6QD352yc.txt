So let's introduce ourselves to the polynomial remainder theorem. And as we'll see it a little, if you feel a little magical at first, but in future videos we will prove it and we'll see, well, like many things in mathematics, when you actually think it through, maybe it's not so much magic. So what is the polynomial remainder theorem? Well it tells us that if we start with some polynomial, f of x, so this right over here is a polynomial, polynomial, and we divide it, we divide, divide by x minus a, then the remainder, then the remainder from that essentially polynomial long division is going to be f of a. It is going to be, it is going to be f of a. f of a, I know this might seem a little bit abstract right now, I'm talking about f of x's and x minus a's. Let's make it a little bit more concrete. So let's say that f of x, f of x is equal to, I'm just going to make up a, let's say a second degree polynomial. This would be true for any polynomial though. So three x squared minus four x plus seven. And let's say that a is, I don't know, a is one, so we're going to divide by, we're going to divide that, we're going to divide by x minus, x minus one. So a in this case is equal to one. So let's just do the polynomial long division and I encourage you to pause the video and if you're unfamiliar with polynomial long division, I encourage you to watch that before watching this video because I will assume you know how to do the polynomial long division. So divide three x squared minus four x plus seven, divide it by x minus one, see what you get as your remainder and see if that remainder really is f of one. So I'm assuming you've had a go at it, so let's work through it together. So let's divide x minus one, x minus one into three x squared, into three x squared minus four x plus seven. All right, a little bit of polynomial long division is never a bad way to start your morning. It's morning for me, I don't know what it is for you. All right, so I always look at the x term here, the highest degree term, and then I'll start with the highest degree term here. So how many times does x go into three x squared? Well it goes three x times, three x times x is three x squared, so I'll write three x over here. I'm writing it in the, I guess you could say the first degree place. Three x times x is three x squared. Three x times negative one is negative three x. And now we want to subtract, we want to subtract this thing. And this is just the way that you do traditional long division. And so what do we get? Well three x squared minus three x squared, that's just going to be zero. So these just add up to zero. And this negative four x, this is going to be plus three x. A negative of a negative, negative four x plus three x is going to be negative x. Let me do this in a new color. So it's going to be negative, negative x. And then we can bring down the seven. Complete analogy to how you first learn long division in maybe, I don't know, third or fourth grade. So all I did is I multiplied three x times this, you get three x squared minus three x, and then I subtracted that from three x squared minus four x to get this right over here. Or you could say I subtracted it from this whole, from the whole polynomial, and then I got negative x plus seven. So now how many times does x minus one go into negative x plus seven? Well x goes into negative x, negative one times. Negative one times. Negative one times x is negative x. Negative one times negative one is positive one. But then we're going to want to subtract this thing. We're going to want to subtract this thing. And this is going to give us our remainder. So negative x minus negative x, that's the same thing as negative x plus x. So these are just going to add up to zero. And then you have seven, this isn't going to be seven plus one. Remember we have this negative out. So if you distribute the negative, this is going to be a negative one. Seven minus one is six. So your remainder here is six. One way to think about it, you could say, you could say that, you could say, well actually I'll save that for a future video. This right over here is the remainder. And you know when you got to the remainder, and this is just all a review of polynomial long division, is when you get something that has a lower degree. This is a, I guess you could call this a zero degree polynomial. This has a lower degree than what you are actually dividing into, or then the x minus one, than your divisor. So this is a lower degree, so this is a remainder. You can't take this into this any more times. Now by the polynomial remainder theorem, if it's true, and I just picked a random example here, this is by no means a proof, but just a way to make it tangible of what the polynomial remainder theorem is telling us. If the polynomial remainder theorem is true, it's telling us that f of a, in this case one, f of one should be equal to six. It should be equal to this remainder. Now let's verify that. This is going to be equal to three times one squared, which is going to be three, minus four times one, so that's just going to be minus four, plus seven. Three minus four is negative one, plus seven is indeed, is indeed, we deserve a minor drum roll, is indeed equal to six. So this is just kind of, at least for this particular case, it's like okay, it seems like the polynomial remainder theorem worked, but the utility of it is if someone said hey, what's the remainder if I were to divide three x squared minus four x plus seven by x minus one, if all they care about is the remainder, they don't care about the actual quotient, all they care about is the remainder, you can say hey, look, I can just take that, in this case a is one, I can throw that in, I can evaluate f of one, and I'm going to get six. I don't have to do all of this business. All I would have to do is this to figure out the remainder of three x squared, or you take three x squared minus four x plus seven and divide by x minus one.
