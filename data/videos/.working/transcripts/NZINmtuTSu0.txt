So, excited to have Drew Houston here, you know, very well-known figure amongst kind of our team out here. And for those who are maybe watching this video later, founder of Dropbox, how many billions of people do you have using it? I know it's more like hundreds of millions only. 300 million. 300, only 300 million people using it, file sharing, we'll talk more about that. The way I view these things, it's definitely for our team to kind of meet and talk to really interesting people in Silicon Valley and beyond, but also for kind of just the general Khan Academy user base out there to kind of get exposure to really interesting people in Silicon Valley and beyond. And with that lens, you know, I always think of kind of myself when I was 12 or 13 years old and when I used to watch like Johnny Carson, and I always used to wonder like, who are these people? How do they do that? Like, what did I have to like major in in order to become that person? And so I kind of want to have a little bit of that lens. So I'll start there. You know, when you were a kid, what did you see yourself doing or becoming and how did you try to set that up? So my path started when I was really little. So my parents had a PC junior. So very first computer and I was really little. And my dad, so first I would just play computer games on it. A couple of years later, my dad got showed me how there's a thing on the computer called basic. And so I was lucky they showed me how to write some of my first lines of code. And I was like, really, really little. Like how little? I was five. That's good. Yeah, very nice to get in line. And so as you can imagine, it turns out when you're in your when you're little like that, you have a lot of free time on your hands. And so I was always like playing on the computer and I really loved playing games. And so that was actually why I wanted to learn programming is to learn how to make games, how these things worked. And like when I sort of my exploration of how the computer worked, I would figure out like there's like this, you know, there's like files and like, okay, then when I save a game, like I can go into that file and like give myself like 32,767 lives, you know, like it's like, it would be all these little things like that. And if only I could access this file from home and kindergarten. Moving this floppy drive around. Yeah. So I thought I was gonna make computer games. That was that was what I that that would that was what I was interested in beginning. I was then as far as a job, I started up babysitting. Really? So I was very good at like, like watching as like 12, maybe 11. And like I would the parents would leave, I put the kids to bed. And I'd like I was very good at watching like HBO and like this is like a requirement. I got only like babysit for like families that had like good TV and like Pringles and things like that. And they didn't view that as a red flag. Your focal point was her cable. Exactly. Yeah. And then like trying to like and then sometimes I'd be like watching something probably like shouldn't be watching. There'd be like, you know, shooting or like bad words. And I was very good at like listening from in the lock when they're the key went in the lock. Oh, yes. Anyway, this has nothing to do with starting a company. But sometimes. But then I got a little bit of an upgrade on the job front. I was beta testing a game and an online game. I was maybe 14 and they were taking forever to build the game. And so I started getting restless and curious and started poking around under the hood of this game. And I found all these security holes. So I found all these vulnerabilities. Anyway, at first you discover these things. You're like, oh my God, oh my God. I started impersonating like the developers and things like that and sort of making a little like a little bit of trouble. But then I'm like, guys, send them an email. I'm like, guys, you really you should fix this. You should fix this. And you shouldn't have done this this way. You should have done this way. And I'm like, you know, really getting into it. And they're like, well, do you want to work here? And so I ended up working remotely as an engineer or like, do you want to fix those bugs? And I'm like, OK. And then, you know, this is the first kind of startup adventure. First experience of many where my stock options were worth nothing. And this is 14 years old. 14 years old. And so it's part time remote. And but it was like a cool thing to talk about in like biology class. And you know, I had to get my dad to sign all the employment paperwork and things like that. So but that was the path. So I was literally working on a game. But then fortunately, there are as you learn, there's a lot of other things in life beyond like Unreal Tournament, which are really interesting. Beyond what? Unreal Tournament or Starcraft? Unreal Tournament. Yes. And so that was a little later on. Like PC PC era is like more like the Sierra games, like this quest for something like that. You guys were born. For me, it was for me, it was Pong. OK. All right. I'm a little over. We're losing them. We have a little overlap. And then and then and then you go to MIT. We had you know, many of us have been there as well. And you know, I watched your commencement speech. I watched your commencement speech, which was great. You know, it helped that the guy before you really set a new low in terms of commencement speech quality. But your speech was really, I thought, a really powerful speech. And I think it kind of hit this issue of like, you know, you didn't plan on being, you know, Drew Housen Dropbox founder, but you did think you were going to be an entrepreneur. I mean, it seems like while you were in college, you were constantly thinking about starting a business of some kind. Yeah. And your speech was great, too. I mean, I wasn't fishing for that. No, no, it was. It feels good, though. You know, you're sort of like there's no instruction manual for these things. You start like googling excessively for like every commencement speech ever given before. Anyway, so but no, I did plan to be, I always was excited about doing something that was my own thing, whether I was making a computer game or eventually as I learned more about business and starting a company. I was always, it just turned out that I had joined startups as an engineer or like an intern when I was little and then just didn't never really laugh. And did you keep doing that while you were in college? I mean, you already had that kind of experience when you're starting stuff, like when you were freshman year or sophomore year, were you doing stuff? So the game company unfortunately folded pretty quickly. But that then gives me that experience and led me to get a job at a local company. That was another startup. Actually, but it was kind of an MIT founders. So there's kind of a relation there. But yeah, in the summers, I would take classes and then every summer I would go work at first couple of years, it was the company that I worked at in high school. So they were like maybe half hour outside of Boston. Yeah. And the one thing that I think is mysterious for everyone, and even sometimes when people ask me, I don't have a clear answer because it's still a little bit mysterious, is how do you stumble on this thing that just kind of takes off like wildfire that just... And you have an interest story. I mean, you actually started kind of a little bit closer to kind of what we do here at your first startup, which I think you started your junior year, was around SAT, it was called Accolade. Right. So you never know where these things are going to go because I mean, I think anybody who grows up programming or whether it's programming or something else, like it's always tinkering with things. There's always just one project after another. And then the first time I want to start a company, I took my junior year off from MIT. So I took a year leave, which ended up being like a really great experience. And I promised my parents I would come back and I did. But so the SAT at the time was changed. There was like all this change happening, right? They're merging in the writing section. It's going from 1600 points from 1600 to 2400. Now I know there's all kinds of other stuff happening. But this was back in the day where, you know, as a study for the SAT, you would have to show up at some horrible classroom at like eight in the morning on a Saturday to listen to some like 17 year old who didn't want to be there either and all those just reading out of a book. Like this was the state of the art in like SAT prep. And we're like, guys, like the internet, it's not like the internet's been here for like a little while. It's like it's been here for a long time. Like why are we still, it was like how my parents studied for the SAT. And so I teamed up with actually one of my former teachers from my high school and we started building a new kind of course or an online course for the, for the, what was then the new SAT. And what's your lesson? I mean, what caused you to, I guess not do that at some point? I mean, you worked on it for some time. You did. It was interesting. So I started working on it because I'm like, here's, here's like an opportunity. Here's something that my co-founder and I knew really well. I mean, I just, you know, I don't know. I treated the SAT, like one of the things I really like to do is like reverse engineer like how things work, take things apart. So whether that's, you know, more typical stuff like the kind of tinkering that kids do or like, you know, one of my, so like, or the finding all the security problems in that, in that, in that game. When I started working on the SAT, like, or had to study for it, I was, I was like, how does this thing work? And so you can, as you know, there are always like little tricks and little patterns you can take advantage of. And I'm like, okay, the only, the really hard thing about the verbal section is, is the vocab because like you can, in general, you can teach someone how to do a sentence completion without even really teaching them. It's the words that are, that are hard. So I, when I was 16, I wrote all this software to do kind of flashcards and adapt and remember which ones I was getting right and which ones I was getting wrong and things like that. Because I didn't want, it was too lazy to like cut out all the paper flashcards. And I'm like, this is so stupid. And so I had done that, and that, that code actually was kind of on the shelf for five years and then, and then when the SAT changed and I had a friend of mine who was a teacher who had his own SAT course. And then we had this whole shtick going. Like he, he, I was at MIT, he had graduated from Harvard, like you know, through, as a result of all this like reverse engineering at SAT and studying a lot before I got to 1600. So I was like, we had all like the boxes checked for the parents and we're like, we know how this works. So that, it was really just seeing an opportunity and being like, you know, you don't attach too much of an outcome around it. Like I didn't have a goal of like, oh, I need to make this much money or whatever. It's just sort of like another interesting project and, and probably the best part of it was really just having an excuse to learn about business in like a rigorous way. So and what I mean a rigorous way, I mean like, I'm like, I didn't know anything about sales or marketing or finance or like any of these subjects. And they all seem very like remote and mysterious. And so to combat this, I would just go on Amazon and type in like sales and then like find like the top three rated or most popular sales books and just like read them and repeat that. And you found that valuable. And it's super useful. Like reading is like one of the probably the most important reading about business is probably the most important thing that's prepared me for, for running, for running Dropbox. And then what, what was it? And you, you talk a little bit about it in your commencement speech. I find this transition is kind of the most interesting one is, you know, what you were working on this for two years, I think, in through your graduation, what kind of, you know, it's hard as you're told to persevere and keep working on something, don't give up. But at some point, maybe you are kind of putting good time after that. Yeah. So I, it was super interesting in the beginning because like, you know, and when you first get to work, you, you, you, you know, you get down to such important orders of business of like, all right, you know, I got to Photoshop a logo and print out business cards that say founder on them and other very important and then hand them out to people so that, so that they, so that they know that I'm a founder now, you know, it's like, this is like the stuff you, I still do that. Yeah. But then, you know, what you realize is after that kind of, you know, after you're like incorporated and you get your like facts back from the Delaware Secretary of State and these things all seem very official and important. You're like, after you're like day number 74 of like, I got to take out the trash, like, you know, we got to erase the whiteboard and like all this, it's like, you're like, actually, this is a lot of work. And which was, it was good. But so I think with my first company, you know, I didn't, none of it, neither of us knew what we were doing at all. And so we were bootstrapping it. There's just a lot of kind of manual labor around like I was, you know, we were too cheap to get like employees. So and we didn't have any money. So you know, who's going to write the math questions is like me and I just still remember having to like, force myself to like write these math questions and draw these diagrams and be like, all right, so where did the train leave from last time? Okay, so the train, this train leaves, you know, Sacramento, etc. And like, and so I'm like, God, at some point, I'm just like, I can't do it. We have people who do that. So it's actually quite fun. Yeah. I seriously, I find that I do. And so but but to, you know, I feel your pain. No, no, it and but but the problem wasn't really the work. It was just more like we're putting a lot of effort into it and not seeing a lot of return. It was for me. It wasn't, you know, I was kind of lost some of the variety of the work. And and so I just got kind of it just became harder and harder. I felt like I had to push myself like so much like it. And, you know, I'm like, this is it just became something I dreaded. It became something where I have to trick myself into like making progress. And I'm like, and then I start like it's this like negative spiral, right? Because you're like you start resenting the work. You start getting mad at yourself because you're like, why am I not more disciplined? Like why is like why and you just and it's just like then which makes you resent it even more and thinks there's something wrong with your side. It's like all this stuff, all this like stuff in your head. And and then what happened was I had a friend of mine who started a company and did things a little bit more properly. Like he had a co-founder who he was like really good friends with. They raised money. They could just set up the company like a good normal company. And then they were just having a blast. They were working like just every waking hour. But like they were just having fun like every minute. This is what it looked like and felt like. And so I was like, at first I'm like, man, maybe I'm really defective. Like look, these guys are having no problem with this. But then what happened was I actually started, I would find these little side projects and I started working on a poker bot. Again, reverse engineering, like figure, people said this is impossible. I'm like, it is possible. And so I was really good at the security and kind of reverse engineering part of it and could do enough of the AI. But and it was like this, I was just possessed. Like I would be dragging my computers around everywhere. Like my parents would ask, had me come up to New Hampshire because we have a little place, like this place on a lake where you're supposed to get away from technology. Next thing, I'm putting three monitors on the kitchen stove because there's not enough room and working on this thing. And so, but it turned out, I mean, you never know how these things are going to sort of all line up. But then when I was working on, I was still working on the SAT prep company and my friend Adam, who I mentioned, moved out to San Francisco. And next thing I know, he's two years younger than me, but the next phone call I get from him, he's like, hey, I've raised $5 million. And I was like, that's a lot of money. Like that number has like two commas in it. Like what the hell? And this is like my little brother in our fraternity. And I'm like, my god. And so, but it just turned out that, in part, it was sort of the setup was there. Like I really loved algorithms and distributed systems and I studied computer science. And these are my favorite things. And so it was sort of fertile ground. And then one time I left my thumb drive at home and so I couldn't get any work done for my company. And the sort of non-PR, like the director's cut version of sort of the Dropbox origin story. So I was riding, taking a ride on the Chinatown bus, the Fung Hwa from Boston and New York. And I left my thumb drive behind and I'm just like, I hate, I'm like, what do you do in these situations? And you're like, you're not like, I hate my thumb drive. I'm like, I hate myself. I'm so stupid. I'm so disorganized. I keep doing this. Why can't I be better? And just the self-flagellation. And there's nothing else to do for like four and a half hours. But I had this three gigabyte Linux virtual machine image that I need to keep in sync across all these computers. Because I had worked on a laptop sometimes, sometimes a desktop, sometimes another computer. And like nothing, there were a million things that claimed to solve this problem and none of them actually did. And so it was really personal frustration that led me to open up the editor and start writing some code that eventually turned into Dropbox. Although I had no idea that would be the case at the time. And I think this is an important moment because a lot of times when you read about Dropbox, you say, oh yeah, he had the idea of having sharing files across multiple devices and all that. But whenever I read, I was like, no, what's amazing isn't the idea is actually a very old idea. In fact, almost anyone who's worked on data storage or anything has, for the last 40 years, has been trying to do this. And so to me, the power of, or almost the audacity of what you, this was a big problem that a lot of really smart people had kind of tried to do, as you mentioned, maybe even launched companies on it, didn't have really complete solutions. What was kind of going on in your head that convinced you that, no, I think the path that I'm about to take on this problem is going to be the one that works. Well, it was just so clear from trying all the other things that, like 100 things that claimed to solve this on paper, but in practice, they never really worked. And at school at MIT, sometimes you have a campus network or a sort of hardcore, unix-y kind of way of solving this problem. But for a Windows computer or a MacBook, you're stuck carrying around a thumb drive and emailing yourself stuff. And that was your point. I was more just amplify the frustration. I'm like, guys, this is not a new idea. We've thought about this like the 60s. Like why the hell am I forced to do that? Like it really made me upset. And then there's some conviction. I was like, look, the problem with all the online drives is like these very specific technical things where it's like, it's all a big hack where the way the online drives, the i drives and x drives, and for every letter there's been a drive. For all of them, they all worked on the same basic principle, which was like, okay, we're going to trick your applications and operating system into thinking that instead of when a program writes something to the disk, instead of writing it to the disk inside the laptop, it actually intercepts it, sends it over to the internet to the server somewhere, and gets it back. So at first glance, you're like, this is a great idea. We'll work with everything. It's not that hard. But the problem is if the server is 100 milliseconds away instead of 5 milliseconds away like your hard drive or less, then you get all these inexplicable problems. Because millions and millions and millions of lines of code are all written with assumption that this thing is like 5, 10 milliseconds away. And I'm going into detail on this example. But there's no way you can ever make that work. It's just laws of physics. And so you need a completely different approach and sort of a hybrid where you have big and cheap and fast storage locally and on a server. But it's like two swimming pools connected by a straw. And so first use the straw well. And two, make it so that you're not waiting for the swimming pool to make it back and forth. Use it efficiently. Do that in the background. Sinking. Right? So and then it just turned out no one had gotten the technical part right. But then there's also a design piece of how to design the interface, how do you make this, what's a metaphor that people can understand. And then there's an academic piece of it, which is the algorithms and how do you move the files around and things like that and store them. But then there's a lot of grungy operating systems work. Where how do you make it so that you work, the FAT32 file system, every other file system when it stores, next to the name of the file, it stores like when the file was modified. And it's a time stamp and it's a resolution of one second. It's actually more detailed now. But just listen. And then you'd be like just randomly on some random operating system, some random hard drive, you can have a FAT32 file system that stores that modification time with a resolution of two seconds. And it's like none of the other ones do that, but that one does. And so they just adds all this weird complexity to the code or like Windows XP, Service Pack 3. There'd be bugs where like the Swedish version of that, not the Norwegian version, the Swedish version of this, it would just like cause Dropbox to crash. And so, you know, part of, so it's two things. Like one is, you know, a fundamentally different approach from what some of the other guys are doing. And then two is the, a lot of just like that kind of obsession. Like the same thing, the same way I was like obsessed with like making a very well crafted like, you know, SAT question about quadrilaterals and making the diagram look like the actual, it was like then obsessing over making it really fast and reliable and fixing that obscure bug with Swedish Windows. And when did you realize, you start on this, you see a problem, you start tackling it, and it is an audacious problem to tackle. When did you say, this is real, this is like I have a solution here, like this is already better than what's out there in industry? So first was when I just made something that worked for myself. And I'm like, I could actually use it. Like I would put, save something and it would like show up on my other computer and I'd be like, finally. And then, but it really started to take shape once I made a video, a demo video of Dropbox, like a three minute little, it's still online somewhere, or you can find it. And I put it on Hacker News, which is a news site for startups. And it just got a ton of, it was like top of Hacker News for like two days. Like these were the old days, so it was easier to do that. But that gave me like a ton of, I mean, I had already decided to quit my job, so it was complicated. So I just graduated, I was working as an engineer at a startup, and I was moonlighting on my SAT prep thing. That was the other thing. So you're asking why did I kind of get frustrated? And it's like we, my co-founder wasn't going to quit his job. I wasn't really either. This thing was never really going to succeed, but it also wasn't going to die. So it just got kind of frustrating. But anyway, so Dropbox really, the first real turning point was when I put the video up and then Arash, my co-founder, saw it on Hacker News. Like we got that later, like a week later, we got introduced through mutual friend. So I got a co-founder from it, Paul Graham. It was Arash, my co-founder, and then our first investor, Paul Graham, saw the video and emailed me saying, because I just applied solo to Y Combinator with the idea, and so. So that's one of the first things. This was your second interaction with Paul Graham. I had a complicated series of interactions before. So Paul, so Y Combinator is kind of like applying to college, right? Lots of people want to get in not enough spots. You have this very competitive dynamic. And so actually the sort of admission system was how I thought about getting into Y Combinator. And so I had actually been flown out to California to hang out with some other Y Combinator founders. And I also wanted to pitch Paul on Dropbox. And so I showed up at Y Combinator a little early before one of the dinners and walked into his office and asked if I could show him Dropbox. And he was very angry about that. He did not, visitors were not. But that first video was huge in terms of getting started. Yeah, and then you get started, and I mean, and this, what year was this? This was 2007? 2007. 2007. And then it's just been kind of, I mean, I don't think I've ever seen it. I mean, you guys have got to be one of the fastest growing organizations maybe in the history of the Valley. It's been growing quickly. I don't, they're all, people are setting all kinds of records these days. But the company, in terms of headcount, has grown really fast. And then the user base has grown from, yeah, 2009, we're like a million users, now we're over 300. And given to where, what are your, kind of in hindsight, or now that you can look over the last seven years, I mean, what have been, and I almost knew this, and we were talking a little bit about this before we did this, is what's kind of your, what would you have told yourself when you, if it was an 80 person organization or a 90 person organization that, kind of like, either ease your stress or let you know that something's coming or ways to manage it as you grow? Well, I think there's a lot. And it's hard to kind of boil it down to like pithy phrases of like, oh, this is how you build a company. How do you play basketball? Well, it'll take a while to explain, right? But I think the, I don't really know how to play, I'm not very good at basketball. I am, but I'm not kidding, I'm horrible. Dude, all right. So what I would say is, some of the earliest and most helpful advice that we got was really to focus on the people we brought into the company, like make sure everybody's really, really talented. Like that's probably the best hack you can do to make everything else easier, right? Cuz put a good person between you and all your problems, right? And our angel investors and some of our early folks were like, just kept drilling that into our heads. Like make sure the talent bar is really high, be very choosy. And I think just sort of an attitude of really trying to systematically train, to understand like, okay, well, here's what I'm dealing with today. But I'm gonna talk to people who are maybe six months ahead, a year ahead, five years ahead, and like what are they dealing with? Like what would they, I asked this quite, I was talking to another CEO, 8,000 person company, I'm like, all right, we're approaching 1,000 people in Dropbox. What am I gonna see between 1,000 and 2,000? What should I watch out for? What would you put in place now so that as you've done all these things and grown the company, what do you wish you could do today? So a lot of what I do is sort of think about that. And sort of all, you have to be able to see around corners. And one way to do that is reading. One way to do that is having mentors and getting advice. But and then the other thing that gives you some calm is that what you read on TechCrunch or in the press generally, when someone tells a story of a company, they're like, yeah, Dropbox, it started out with not a lot of users. Then later they had a lot of users and they did great. And they just have this narrative arc that you just, you're like, well, the real truth is this complicated stuff happened and this was actually really hard. They're like, yeah, yeah, no, okay, two MIT kids in a dorm room have an idea. And so the truth is it's actually very complicated and hard, but that all kind of gets glossed over. But when you read profiles, there's a lot of books that have been written about their lately, the Everything Store is a book about Amazon, it's a great book. Steve Jobs biography, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, all these Intel, like Oracle, I've read as many kind of profiles on tech companies and other companies as I could get my hands on over these companies over the last few decades. And what you learn is that once you sort of look behind the curtain, there's nothing that's that magical. And so, and that's important for people to understand because you might think, I don't know anything about business. So I should just go, I'm never gonna be good at it because I've never been good at it. And that's just something, I should go get a business guy or a person to do that stuff cuz I'll never be good at it. But it's actually something you can learn. And so I think that mindset of in a week you're probably limited in terms of what you can do, but think about playing an instrument or becoming a doctor, all of us can realize, yeah, it's a lot of work, but I can sort of see a path from A to B. Turns out most things you wanna learn have that kind of potential. Whether it's public speaking or building a company or any of those things, if you have the attitude that, and you give yourself time, you can actually pick these things up. There's nothing that magical about them. And that's one thing from these profiles. And then the other thing, cuz you see in the early days, they make all these really crazy, stupid mistakes and do all these things that are really, really wrong. And then that's also therapeutic, cuz you realize all these companies are a total mess. And actually, I see Albert in the corner. Albert was an early dropboxer. Albert can tell you what a mess early dropbox was. And so what you read about is actually not reflective of reality. It's a much messier and kind of less glamorous process. Yeah, and I'm about to go into some questions from the team. But just to, my last question is, where do you see kind of dropbox in five, ten, fifty years, at the end of your life, what do you hope dropbox has done? 50 years. I don't know if anybody's made self-driving boats yet, but. That would be an innovation. I mean, but in the, you can't really look that far out. But what we've realized and what we talk a lot about is we have this opportunity, where now we have a lot of resources, a lot of really talented people. We can solve these really big problems. And then what we're really working on is building this home for everybody's most important stuff, right? Cuz you think about your house 20 years ago. Like you'd walk into your house, there'd be like mail on the table. You'd go in your living room. Your photos are on your kitchen. Your photos are on your refrigerator, right? And you go down the hall and your briefcase has your documents and all that stuff is now on servers or in your dropbox. And so we need this new kind of home. So we think all the time about how can we save hundreds of millions of people from these things that are really painful and annoying about technology. Like all these little paper cuts forgetting the equivalent of, these little thumb drive problems are everywhere, right? And so how do we find the biggest ones and solve them at massive scale? And then specifically, we started out with this app that you put on your computer or your phone that gets used like Dropbox folder. But really what you want is, what you're using that folder for is often you're putting photos in there. You're getting work done, you're collaborating with other people. And so we're starting to dig into some of those use cases a little more with things like we just launched a photo app called Carousel. Which is like if the gallery on your phone had every picture you've ever taken. And if you could text 100 or 1,000 photos and videos at a time, that's what Carousel lets you do. For some reason that had not really existed or no one, everybody has this problem, just no one solved it. Yeah, awesome. So I'll go into some of these questions. The first one, this is from Marsha. You can raise your hand, Marsha, where's Marsha? I don't know. Where's Marsha? She's remotely. So what's your typical work day like? Probably the biggest thing I spend time on is recruiting. And so often there will be some kind of fire drill at night where it's like, OK, we're acquiring a company or there's some candidate and we're fighting with Google or some startup to try to get them. There's a tug of war. And I'm often finding myself down here going big game hunting for people to join Dropbox. So I'll be in the Google campus. Or if you see me in one of these companies, you know what I'm doing. And so recruiting is the biggest thing. And then probably the next biggest thing is just meetings and small numbers with people on my team around certain projects. So every six months we pick a dozen things that are really important that we want to get done. And then I'll be spending time with them, like, OK, here's new stuff we're going to do in collaboration. Or here's answering questions like that. What is Dropbox? What should it be in five years? What will it be in 50 years? What kind of place do we want to create? And then there's this much longer tale of all kinds of other stuff, whether it's partners or customers or just other things. It's a hard question to answer succinctly. Yeah, that's pretty good. I made something that downloads my Google calendar. I wrote a Python script that downloads my Google calendar into an Excel spreadsheet and triages my time. It's not, you have to supervise. You have to triage the stuff or have someone help you triage the stuff. But then I had these rolling charts of how I spent the last week or the last four weeks or the last 12 weeks. So that I can, because a lot of people say, oh, I spent. I'll use that. All right. All right. That's interesting. You get a little data analytics on your time. It is. It's super important. So I did that more. One of the most important things you need to think about, as your job gets more complicated and there's just more stuff competing for your time, it's really important to understand where it goes. There's a book called The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker. Any book on management will focus on that. So, but there's another thing. It's like no one's created a tool where you can see where your time goes. It's like everybody, a lot of people have that problem. So, but anyway, so I have been at times very rigorous about that. Very cool. And so I have a question from Dylan. Dylan's right over there. So what are some of the most interesting, unexpected, fun technical challenges that you and your team have faced in the process of scaling drop-backs to hundreds of millions of users? So I think it's just fundamentally the challenge of Dropbox itself. I mean, we're building, you know, we're trying to build like the file system for the internet. And so how do you connect, you know, a billion devices, right? And so that comes along with all kinds of technical challenges where, you know, people are saving a billion files every day on Dropbox. And so, you know, that's more than there are tweets on Twitter. And this is not like little 140 characters. This is like your wedding photos, right? Pictures, yeah. Yeah. So you can have nothing, you can't have a bad day, right? So even just the core service. But then, you know, as you branch out, then there's all these interesting things with, you know, how do we make a, there's more sort of far field things like computer vision, like how do we, you know, for photos or something, how do we organize your photos for you? Like search, you know, pretty much every kind of like client software, we have big data, we have data science, we have, you know, a bunch of infrastructure stuff, like every permutate, every possible platform, every, if people are like really into like hardcore algorithms, we need like that. And if we have people that are really deep into systems, we have like unlimited need for that, a bunch of storage stuff. I mean, it's just, it's really all over the map. Like it feels like any permutation of technical challenge, we have it, at least in software. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I think we have time for one more. So this is from Joel, there's Joel right there. So he'd like to hear about Hack Week. And this is, we've had a little bit of it, we want to do more of this. How did it get started and has any, what new stuff has come out of it? Has anything actually been productized? So Hack Week is basically something we do every year. You guys have probably heard of a hackathon or like a one day hacking event. But we're like, all right, let's take this to 11, we'll do a whole week. And because sometimes, you know, Dropbox, it would have been hard to prove that in a day, but actually the first prototype had something reasonably working in a week. And so it's something we do really to sort of get back to the spirit of like where we started, where, you know, there are no constraints. A lot of people were telling us that what we were doing was a lot of investors told me that Dropbox, it's a stupid thing to get into, have yet another storage company where all the other ones have failed. But like, it just doesn't matter. Instead of like talking or debating, like actually write code and just like, and if you do it right, like you can change how people think. And so a ton of things have made it into the product from having a personal and business account in Dropbox. That was a huge project that started out as a Hack Week project. One of my Hack Week projects was the new, the way you do notifications, or like the sort of the menu bar in Dropbox is not like the native menu, like you can see like what's changed and have a different UI around that. Things like a bunch of security stuff, so two factor authentication was something that started there. A lot of how you can like rewind your files or undo things, that was a Hack Week project. And then a lot of other stuff which maybe didn't make it one to one, like or like make it pound for pound into the product. But even just like when we watch people build like all these apps on top of Dropbox, like that inform, like someone made like a, you know, a jukebox kind of music player as a separate app. And it just sort of like plants a seed that may, may manifest itself years later in something like, oh well, now instead of just having the Dropbox app, you have a whole family of apps. Like Carousel, Mailbox, Dropbox. So it's really just a time for A, just to work on anything except what you're supposed to be working on. B, like unleash people and remember kind of, like lift the constraints of day to day. And three, it's to change how people think about, you know, if you have an idea, like prove it and, and, you know, what you learn is people have like a lot of really, you know, it's a pretty amazing group of people we have in the company. And we've had interns like take Dropbox and put it, put it in a weather balloon and put an Android phone into space where this phone will be taking pictures of the ride up and down. And so it's just crazy. You just have this like pictures uploading in the Dropbox of like space. Well, I just want to thank you. I think, you know, I think I speak for, for, for, for, for everyone here that, you know, it's been a real treat to kind of get to know you just now. So, so thank you very much. Great. Thanks. Awesome. Thank you.
