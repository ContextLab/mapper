Puja had a beautiful plant. The plant began sprouting two days before Puja bought it, and she had it for 98 days before it died. At its tallest, the plant was 30 centimeters tall. All right. Let H of t denote the height of Puja's plant H, measured in centimeters, t days from the time she bought it. Which number type is more appropriate for the domain of the function, and they tell us whether it's integers or real numbers? So we just have to remind ourselves, the domain of a function, that's the set of all the inputs for which the function is defined. And the inputs here, these are t, and it represents days. And if I input t, the number of days, into the function H, it'll output the height of the plant. So let's think about it. At first you might think in terms of zero days, one days, two days, and you might be tempted to say integers, but why not think about one and a half days, or 3.175 days? So I don't see any reason why t couldn't be a subset of real numbers. Why you can think about the 97.99th day. So I would say real numbers, and I say define the interval of the domain. So t, let's see, the t would be defined up to two days before she bought the plant. So that's t is equal to negative two all the way to 98 days. And t could be equal to negative two, that would be two days before she bought it, or as high as 98. So let's think about it. So the interval, I would include negative two, I would include the low point. So that's why I'm using the brackets. If I wanted t to be greater than, not greater than or equal to, I would do the parentheses. But since t could be equal to negative two, I'm going to use the brackets. So at the high end, it's 98, and we're going to include 98. So I'm going to put the brackets there as well. So t would be a member of real numbers such that it is a member of this interval right over here. So negative t could be negative two, but I was going to say negative two is going to be less than or equal to t, which is going to be less than or equal to 98. Let's check our answer. We got it right.
