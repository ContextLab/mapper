The velocity, V, measured in meters per second of an object can be measured in terms of its mass, measured in kilograms, and kinetic energy, E sub k measured in joules. And they give us this formula here. I'm not going to explain the physics right here. We do that in some physics videos. But let's just take this formula right over here, and they say, what is the kinetic energy of a bowling ball with a mass of 3 kilograms? So our M is 3 kilograms. This is our M. And it is traveling at 6 meters per second. This right over here is the magnitude of our velocity. So they tell us that this is V, so it's 6 meters per second. So we have 6 is equal to the principal square root of 2 times the kinetic energy. That's what we need to solve for. They say, what is the kinetic energy of a bowling ball? So this is the unknown. So we have it's equal to 2 times the kinetic energy we need to solve for. So what is the kinetic energy of a bowling ball? And then all of that over the mass. All of that over the mass. And the mass over here is 3 kilograms. And so we need to solve for this E sub k. So a good first step is to try to get rid of this radical sign. It's been isolated already. There's nothing else here outside of the radical. So we can square both sides of this equation. And whenever you're solving an equation that involves a radical, you'll get some solute. You want to isolate the radical. Square it, get rid of the radical, and then solve it like you would solve any equation. But you have to be careful to check your solutions. Because in this equation right here, we have the principal square root, the positive square root. Sometimes when you do a solution, because when you square this, the square of this thing is also going to be the square of the negative square root of this. And so you have to be careful with your solutions that your solutions satisfy the principal square root. So let's try this out. So square both sides of this equation. So we'll square both sides. And on the left-hand side, I'll write it over here, we get 36 is equal to the square root of all of this stuff squared is just going to be all of this stuff. So 2 times E sub k. 2 times E sub k. All of that over 3. All of that over 3. And now we can multiply both sides by 3 halves. And we'll just be left with E sub k on the right-hand side. So let's multiply the right-hand side by 3 halves. And let's multiply the left-hand side by 3 halves. And 3 halves I got, because essentially the coefficient on the E sub k. And so your right-hand side, 3 cancels with 3, 2 cancels with 2. We are just left with an E sub k on the right-hand side. And on the left-hand side, you have 3 divided by 2 times 36. 36 divided by 2 is 18. 2 divided by 2 is 1. 3 times 18 is 30 plus 24 is 54. And this is going to be 54 joules, because the formula they gave us, they said if the mass is measured in kilograms and the v is measured in meters per second, then the E sub k right over here is going to be measured in joules. So the kinetic energy of a bowling ball with a mass of 3 kilograms that is traveling at 6 meters per second, it is going to be 54 joules.
