Let's say that I've got two Chuck Norris's, or maybe it's Chuck Nori, and to that I am going to add another three Chuck Norris's. So I'm gonna add another three Chuck Norris's, and this might seem a little bit obvious, but how many Chuck Norris's do I now have? Well, two Chuck Norris's, we can represent this as literally a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris. So let me do that, a Chuck Norris plus another Chuck Norris. Two Chuck Norris's, you could also do that as two times Chuck Norris, and this is just another way of representing it. And three Chuck Norris's, three Chuck Norris's, you could do that as a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris plus another Chuck Norris. And so we would have a grand total, and this might be very simple for you, but you would have a grand total of one, two, three, four, five Chuck Norris's. So this would be equal to five Chuck Norris's. Now let's get a little bit more abstract here. Chuck Norris is a very tangible thing. So let's go to a little bit more of traditional algebraic notation. If I have two X's, two X's, and remember, two X, you could do this as two X's or two times X, and to that I would add three X's, and to that I would add three X's, how many X's do I have? Well, once again, two X's, that's two times X, you could do that as an X plus an X. We don't know what the value of X is, but whatever that value is, we can add it to itself. And then three X's are going to be that value, let me do that in that same green color. Three X's are going to be that value plus that value plus whatever that value is. And so how many X's do I now have? Well, I'm gonna have one, two, three, four, five X's. So two X plus three X is equal to five X. And if you think about it, all we really did, and hopefully you conceptually get it, is we just added the two numbers that were multiplying the X, and these numbers, the two or the three, they're called coefficients. Very fancy word, but it's just this constant number, this regular number that's multiplied by the variable. You just added the two and the three to get your five X. Now let's think about this a little bit more. Let's go back to this original expression, the two Chuck Norris's plus three Chuck Norris's. Let's say to that we were to add, let's say we were to add some type of a, let's say we were to add seven plums over here. So this is my drawing of a plum. So we have seven plums plus two Chuck Norris's plus three Chuck Norris's. And let's say that I add another two plums. I add another two plums here. So what would this whole thing be? Well, I wouldn't add the seven to the two to the three plus the two, we're adding different things here. You have two Chuck Norris's and three Chuck Norris's, so they're still going to simplify to five Chuck Norris's. And then we would separately think about the plums. We have seven plums, and we're adding another two plums. We're going to have nine plums, plus nine plums. So this simplifies to five Chuck Norris's and nine plums. Similarly, over here, if I had, instead of just two X plus three X, if I had seven Y, seven Y, plus two X plus three X plus two Y, what do I now have? Well, I can't add the X's and the Y's, they could very well represent a different number. So all I can do is really add the X's, and then I get the five X, and then I'd separately add the Y. If I have seven Y's and two that I add two Y's, I'm going to have nine Y's. If I have seven of something and I add two of something, I now have nine of that something. So I'm going to have nine Y's. So you add that, and then a different color. You add this and this, you get that. You add the X's, you add the X's, you get that right over there. So hopefully that makes a little sense. Actually, I'll throw out one more idea. So given this, what would happen if I were to have two X plus one plus seven X plus five? Well, once again, you might be tempted to add the two plus the one, but they're adding different things. These are two X's, this is just the number one. So you really just have to add the X's together. So you're going to say, well, I got two X's, and I'm going to add seven X's to that. Well, that means I now have nine X's. And then separately, you would say, well, I've got just the abstract number one, and then I got another five. One plus five is going to be equal to six.
