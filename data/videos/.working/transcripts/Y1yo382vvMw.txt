Let's say that we've got three bunnies here, and we're essentially adding up their weight. So each of these little bunny pictures represents the weight of a bunny. And we're told that that equals the weight of these six objects. And these are literally one pound weights. So one thing I want you to think about is how can we represent what we just drew here? How can we represent it algebraically? And to give you a variable to work with, you could really say maybe w for weight. But I'll go with b. So let's say that let's let the variable b equal the weight of a bunny. So if we use b as a weight of a bunny, how can we represent this algebraically using this variable? Well, there's actually a couple of ways to do it. You might say, well, look, each of these represents a b. So I could literally write it as b plus b is going to be equal to, these six pounds. And this is a valid representation, but it's not the simplest representation. If I add something like this, if I have three of something, I literally could instead write it as three times b. So let me do it that way. So instead, let me write it as three b. So this is essentially just another way of representing these three b's. Three b's, or three times b, is equal to six. So how can we now solve for the weight of a bunny? And you might be able to do it in your head, because we're essentially saying three times the weight of a bunny is equal to six. But we're going to do it logically so that you can later do much, much more hard to do in your head problems. Well, if you have three times something and you just want one times that something, the best thing to do might just be divide by three. So if we divide by three right over here, three times b divided by three, well, that's just going to end up with a b. But we can't just divide the left-hand side. And then this equal side wouldn't hold anymore. We have to do the right-hand side as well. So if we divide the right-hand side by three, you get six divided by three. Or we can rewrite this equation as b is equal to two. And you could even think about it visually up here. What we did is we divided both sides by three. If you divide this top left-hand side by three, you get three groups of one bunny each, or the weight of one bunny each. And on the right-hand side, you divide it into three groups of two pounds each. So each bunny must weigh two pounds. Each bunny, the weight of a bunny, must be two pounds. And I think you saw what I did here. I'm multiplying b times three. And then I divided by three to just get a b over here. But you might say, hey, Sal, couldn't you instead have multiplied both sides by 1 third? And then I would say, you? Yes. That is absolutely true. So let's go back to this step right over here. When we had three times b is equal to three times b is equal to six, instead of dividing by three, we could have said, hey, let's just multiply both sides by 1 third. And this is just, I'm using our new algebraic notation for multiplication. This is 1 third times three times b. This is 6 times 1 third. Notice multiplying by 1 third is the exact same thing as dividing by 3. And that's all, when you divide by 3, you are multiplying by 1 third. 1 third times 3 is just going to be equal to 1. So you're just left with a b on the left-hand side. And on the right-hand side, you're left with a 6 times 1 third, which is 2. You're left with the exact same thing. So the general idea here is, whatever we had multiplying by the b, we divided by that to solve for a b. Or you could say we multiplied by its reciprocal, really just a fancy word for 1 over that. But either way, we got that each bunny is 2 pounds.
