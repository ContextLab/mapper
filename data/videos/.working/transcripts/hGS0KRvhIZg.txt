Hi parents and caregivers, I'm Rachel with Khan Academy. Are you ready to unlock a world of learning resources for your child? It all starts with creating your own Khan Academy account. Let's walk through the simple steps together. First, head over to the Khan Academy homepage. You'll see a sign up button in the top right corner of the screen. Click on it and then select the parent option. Now you'll see a few options for creating your account. You can choose to sign up with your Google, Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft account. Or you may sign up with an email address and create your own password. If you're creating your own password, check the information to ensure that it meets the necessary requirements. Once you've completed the sign up process, you'll be taken to your Khan Academy dashboard. This is where you can start exploring all the resources Khan Academy has to offer, including tools for managing your child's learning, which we will cover later in this course. With your new account created, you're now ready to connect with your child's learning journey and support them every step of the way. Check out our next video to see how to edit your own account settings. Happy learning!
