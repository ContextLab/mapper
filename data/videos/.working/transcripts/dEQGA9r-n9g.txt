- [Instructor] Hi, a wordsmiths. Let's break down some vocabulary words. The words for this video
are express and immerse. Let's do definitions. Express. Express is a verb, means to communicate, to show what you think or feel. There's also expression, which is a noun, means a common saying, or
the act of communicating or facial expression, like the delighted face I make when I learn a new word. I have a delighted expression. And immerse is also a verb. It means to put something under water or to get deeply involved
or interested in something. There's also an adjectival
form of immersive, which is immersive. And this adjective means making someone feel like they're completely surrounded or involved in an experience. Like virtual reality, where you put on the goggles and it feels like you're
in the video game. That's immersive. Now let's break these words down. Express, you may recognize the prefix ex, which means out or from, and then of course there's press. It's got Latin origins, sure, but it's an English word all its own. It means press. So express means to
press out, to squish out. Say I take a whole bunch of olives and I put 'em in a press and I squeeze them really hard. They're going to express some olive oil. I'm going to press the oil out of them. And what if we switch around the prefixes and say, in instead of
ex, in instead of out. Now in front of a P, in becomes, im. So to impress, is to press something in. Imagine a block of clay or some soft wax, and you're leaving a dent in it. You're leaving an impression if somebody impresses you figuratively. It's like they've made
a dent on the soft clay of your memory. And speaking of the prefix in, let's talk about immersive. So there's im, meaning in, right? Immersive comes from
mere meaning to plunge. Let me write merg here. Merg, to plunge. A plunging in. You can see this word in the English merge, right? Like to mix, to join up with, to merge with southbound traffic on I-90, leaving Chicago or emerge to come out of something, right, which is ex merge. But we take the X part
out, it's just emerge. But let's use these
words in some sentences. This artwork, a machine that
continuously smashes melons with a hammer expresses the
artist's powerful anger. Sir, please do not touch the artworks. The artwork shows. It communicates the artist's feelings. I this on stage once, many years ago for a theater performance,
I smashed a cantaloupe with a brick and a cantaloupe gunk went sailing all the way across the stage directly into my friend Steven's acoustic guitar. He forgave me, but it took a while. True story. Next sentence. In Cati's latest work
of immersive theater, the audience becomes the jury for a trial performed by the actors. Immersive theater, you see, is when the audience
becomes part of the play. They're surrounded by the play and they're in the play themselves. See people in the jury
box, they are the audience. They are immersed in the play the same way a sponge is immersed in water in the sink. I hope you feel as though
you have been immersed in the world of language study. Thanks for hanging out
with me, wordsmiths. I'll see you in the next one. You can learn anything, David out.
