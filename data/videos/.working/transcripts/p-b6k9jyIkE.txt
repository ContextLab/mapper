In the last video, we took a guess at what the solution was for our differential equation, and we came up with an exponential as our guess. And as we did the analysis, we developed a characteristic equation. We ended up with a complex answer for one of the adjustable parameters, the natural frequency of our circuit. So here's the form of our proposed solution. Now this is getting kind of complicated, but I promise you, we're gonna simplify this pretty soon. We have two solutions for S, S1 and S2 that we plugged in as plus and minus j omega naught, and we have more adjustable amplitude parameters that we have to figure out. So now in this video, we're gonna continue on solving our differential equation. This is our proposed solution. This is a pretty complicated looking expression. And what we're gonna call on here now is something really important in electronics and in general, and it's called Euler's identity. We're gonna use this identity to figure out what to do with these complex exponential terms. So if you search on this term on Khan Academy, you'll find an explanation of where these identities come from, but I'm just gonna state them right here. And what it says is that Euler's identity is e to the jx, anything up there, equals cosine x plus j times sine x. That's one of the identities. And the other identity is e to the minus jx equals cosine of x minus j sine x. So these are useful because we have this exponential function with the complex unit inside of it. When we go over to this side, this is a sort of a normal complex number. Cosine x is some number between plus and minus one. And it's just a normal complex number. So this may help us simplify our life here as we move forward. So that's a really important identity that we get to use to solve our LC circuit. Now I'm gonna go back and rewrite these two exponentials using Euler's identity here. And this is gonna get big, but it'll collapse down pretty soon. Okay, let me move over here. I equals k1 times e to the plus j omega t. Let's use this one here. So that would be cosine x is omega naught t plus j sine x is omega naught t. Plus j sine x is omega naught t. And we use the first one. Okay, now the second term is plus k2 times, now we have the negative up in the exponent. So we use this one. Cosine omega naught t minus k2 times e to the minus. J sine omega naught t. Now we have our solution spread all out across the screen and let's see if we can tidy things up here. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna gather all the cosine terms together, this one and this one, and then I'll gather the sine terms together. Okay, so I equals cosine omega naught t. And cosine is multiplied by k1 and plus k2. All right, now let's add to that. We have j sine and j sine, so I'll write sine omega naught t over here and j times what? J times k1 and this time we have this minus sign that makes it minus k2. All right, so now current is some number times cosine plus j times some number times sine. Now these are two arbitrary constants and I'm gonna just make up another one. I'm just gonna call this one a1. And we'll call this one a2 and we'll call that, I'll use the j, k1 minus k2. And now I can rewrite this as i equals j. Equals a1 cos omega naught t plus a2 sine omega naught t. Good, so from now on we're gonna work with these a's and if I ever wanted to know what the original k's were I would just come back to these equations here. Once I figure out a, I can figure out both the k's. So let's keep pressing on. How do we figure out a1 and a2? To do that we're gonna use the initial conditions, the iC's. And if we think back we remember that in our original schematic we had some q here so which means we had a plus or minus v0, v naught. And we said the current through here started at zero. So that's our initial conditions. V of time equals zero equals v naught and current of time equals zero equals zero. Let's use these two values to help us figure out what a1 and a2 are. And we'll do that in the next video as we continue the derivation of the natural response.
