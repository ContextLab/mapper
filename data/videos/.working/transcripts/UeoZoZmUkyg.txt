We're told Justine shows her friend different ways to model 3.45 or I guess I'm seeing money here. So maybe it's $3.45 or three holes and 45 hundredths or three holes, four tenths and five hundredths, however you wanna think about it. Which of the following could be the models Justine showed? And it says choose three answers. So really three of these are going to be right and one of them is going to be wrong. They could have just said pick the one that does not model it. But anyway, let's just go through it. I'll pause this video, have a go at it before we do this together. All right, now let's do this together. So this right over here, 345 over 100, we could rewrite this over here as 300 over 100 plus 45 over 100. Well, 300 hundredths, this is the same thing as three holes. So this is three holes and 45 hundredths. If I wanted to write that as a decimal, it would be three holes and 45 hundredths. I could also write this if I want, I could rewrite that 45 hundredths. 45 over 100 is equal to 40 over 100 plus five over 100. And that's equal to 40 over 100 is the same thing as four tenths and then I have five hundredths. And that's what we also have here. We have three holes, four tenths and five hundredths. So I like this answer right over here. Now let's look at this one. I have $3, I could give you those as the three holes. And then let's see, I have a quarter, that is 25 cents, a dime, this is 10. And it looks like those are two nickels. So that's five and five. So if I were to add these together, see five plus five is 10, plus 10 is 20, plus 25 is 45. So this looks like three holes and 45 hundredths, or $3 and 45 cents. So I like this one as well. Now this one, it looks like each of these is split into hundredths, because it's a 10 by 10 grid. So this is a hole, two holes, three holes. So so far it's looking good, that's three holes. And then what's this? Well, this doesn't look like 45 hundredths, it's exactly half of the hundredths here. This is 50 over 100. This right over here is 50 over 100. So I would represent this as 3.5, or 3 and 50 hundredths. It's not 3 and 45 hundredths. So this is not our choice. So D is probably going to be the answer, but let's double check this, or it's going to be an answer. So I have two holes here. So this is going to be an answer if this all adds up to another hole and 45 cents. So let's see, I have 25, 25, 25, those are the quarters, and then I have a bunch of dimes here, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, and then I have these nickels here, five, five, five, and five. And what I'm going to do is, let's see, how do I make a dollar? I could take, if I had four quarters, I could make a dollar. I don't have four quarters, but if I have these three quarters, which is 75 cents, and then I add another 25 cents, that right over there is another hole. And then what do I have left over? I have five, 10, 15, plus 30 is 45. So this right over here is 45 cents. So I have one hole, sorry, I have two holes, three holes, and 45 cents. So that's why I like this choice as well.
