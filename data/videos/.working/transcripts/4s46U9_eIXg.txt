Ready to see the teaching assistant you've always wanted? Let's take a look. This is ConMigo's dashboard, brimming with a multitude of unique time-saving features all tailored to elevate your teaching experience. Let's begin with the Lesson Hook feature. Igniting a passion for mathematics can be challenging, but it's profoundly impactful and a definite game changer when accomplished. And powered by ConMigo, I'll be able to design captivating math lesson introductions that ignite student curiosity and hopefully it will spark a thirst for knowledge in math. I can't wait to see what ConMigo comes up with. I'm going to let ConMigo know the grade level that I'm teaching. This is for my Algebra 1 class. It's filled with 9th graders. The topic is going to be Reasoning with Systems of Equations. And then I just ask ConMigo to write me a lesson hook. Wow, these are fantastic. These lesson hooks will really get my students excited about math. Thanks ConMigo. With my students' curiosity ignited, it's time to craft a lesson plan. So I'm going to use ConMigo's Lesson Plan tool. This lesson plan tool is going to help me design a customized plan aligning with my curriculum and my students' needs. Once I click the Lesson Plan button, ConMigo asks me to detail the topic I intend to teach. It then presents a selection of topics from Con Academy's rich course offerings. If my topic isn't listed, ConMigo allows me to incorporate my own content. I'm going to select the first one, Reasoning with Systems of Equations. Once I select my lesson, ConMigo swiftly generates a structured detailed lesson plan tailored to my curriculum and my students. The plan includes objectives, learning activities, guided practice, independent practice, assessments, and so much more to ensure that my students have a complete learning experience. And the lesson plans are fully customizable. I can effortlessly modify any part to better fit my needs. If there's something that I want to change, all I have to do is click on it. And ConMigo gives me the option to chat about it, to make changes to it, or I just want to try something different. I love it. I have complete control over the content. Once I'm happy with my completed lesson plan, ConMigo gives me the option to print it, or I can export it to a Microsoft Word document, a PDF, or I can save it to my Google Drive and upload it to my Google Classroom. This saved me so much time. Thank you so much, ConMigo. Multiple choice assessments with ConMigo is a math teacher's dream come true.

I always like to learn through conversation. Refresh My Knowledge can definitely be a teacher's secret weapon for dynamic and impactful teaching. As a math teacher, you can bridge the gap between abstract concepts and everyday life. The real-world text generator can make math more relevant and engaging for students by connecting concepts to real-life situations. Once I let ConMigo know the intended grade level and topic, ConMigo instantly creates practical applications of math that I can share with my students, enhancing their understanding and interest in the topic. No more, when will I ever use this question because the real-world text generator makes math come alive? If you're looking for a fun, engaging way to learn for your students, you have to try our fun class summary poem feature. It's a unique, rhythmic way to summarize lessons for your students. Let's give it a try. When I select the button, ConMigo wants me to ask my class what they learned today. They learned about calculating percentages. And then ConMigo wants to know a guiding word or theme to help inspire the poem. They all said, ConMigo. Alright, now I'm going to let ConMigo do the rest. And here's the poem. ConMigo the math whiz was quite sage, calculating percentages he took center stage. 50% of 100, that's a piece of cake. But 15% of 60, that might take a break. He crunched and munched numbers in his head. Nine is the answer with a grin, he said. As you can see, it's not just the poem, it's a memory booster, a creativity enhancer and a super cool learning tool. Thanks so much, ConMigo.
