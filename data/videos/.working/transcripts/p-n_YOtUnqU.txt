Vote for me! Vote for Chute and the Dorable Grover! I am pro-ABCs and four 1-2-3s! Plus, I promise I have no skeletons in my closet. I do not even have one in my body. Hey Grover, what are you doing? Oh, hello there, Sal Khan. I am just running for President of the United States of America. I heard there was an upcoming election, so I figured, eh, why not? Well, that's great, Grover. Yeah! Maybe we can help more people vote. Oh, that would be terrific! So, exactly how many votes do I need to win? Well, you know about the Electoral College, right? Of course, Sal, baby! I know exactly what the electrical... Electoral. Electoral College is. Great. So why don't we explain it together for those who don't know? Oh, my certainly. What a brilliant idea. Um... Why don't you start us off? Sure. In a direct democracy, I as a citizen will vote for a candidate, and whichever candidate has the most popular votes in the country, they will become president. But we do not have a direct democracy. We have an indirect democracy. So what happens is, is I vote in my state, I live in California, and whichever candidate gets the most votes in California, will get all of California's 55 electoral votes. And that's true in most states. Whoever gets the most votes in that state gets all of the votes for that state. And that number comes from the number of Congresspeople California has. Um, I am not following. So how can I explain it in a way that you might understand? Chickens. I know chickens! Chickens! They are my biggest demo. Okay, chickens. So instead of electors, we'll say chickens, instead of the electoral college, I'll say chicken college. Okay, that that can follow. Okay, the number of chicken votes for each state is equal to the number of Congresspeople for that state. In every state? Yes. From California to the New York island? From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters? Yes, the 50 states. And so there are a total of 538 chicken votes in the chicken college. For example, Florida has 29 chicken votes. And that's the same as the 29 Congresspeople that they have. Two senators and 27 representatives. Oh, hello there chickens! Okay then. So how do I candidate Grover when the presidency? Well, since there are 538 chicken votes in total, you just have to get more than half of those. More than half? Hmm, let me see here. 1, 2, divided by 8. Grover, we know the actual number. You just have to get at least 270 chicken votes in the chicken college. Just 270 chickens? I can do that! 300 chickens just crossed the road to hear me speak at the rally! Oh great, do you have your speech? Oh yeah, it's just right there. Where did they put it? I'll just wing it. Bye Sal! Bye Grover. Now get out there and vote!
