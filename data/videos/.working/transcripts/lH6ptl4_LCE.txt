In this video, we're going to try to compute 6,742 times 23. So like always, pause this video and try to compute it for yourself. All right, now let's work on this together. And I'm going to do it using what's often known as the standard algorithm. Algorithm's just a fancy word for a series of steps, a process for doing something. So we have 6,742 times 23. And so I'm gonna write the 23 in the same place values. So that's two 10s, so I'm gonna write it under the four 10s over there. And then three ones, I'll write it under the two ones. And it's important to realize this isn't the only way to multiply numbers. In fact, we've studied other methods for doing it in other videos. And it's important to realize what's really going on and how these different methods are all, on some level, doing the same thing, maybe just writing them different or doing them in different orders. So the way that we would tackle it using the standard algorithm, probably the way that your parents first learned to multiply multi-digit numbers like this, is we'll take all of the numbers in 6,742, all of the various places and multiply it by three, and then we're gonna multiply it times two 10s and then we're gonna add everything up. So let's first multiply it times three. So we have two times three, that is six. Then we have four times three. And what people often say is four times three is 12, write the two and then carry the one. But what really just happened is you said four 10s times three is 12 10s. 12 10s can be written as two 10s plus 100. Then we say seven times three is 21, and then you'll say, oh, I have to add that other one. So I get 22. But once again, what just happened? We said seven hundreds times three is 2100, plus another hundred is 2,200s, which can be expressed as 200s and 2,000s. And then last but not least, six times three is 18, plus two is 20. But remember, we're talking about thousands. So this is 20,000s. So then we will move on to the two 10s right over here. So two times two 10s is four 10s. Now some folks might be tempted to put the four over there, but that's not four 10s. Four 10s would be right over here. And so it's common practice as you move to the next place value over, as you get to this two, that people will just put a zero here just so they don't make that mistake. All right, now let's keep going. What is four times two? Well, that's eight. We'll just write the eight right over there. Why did that work? Well, we're having four 10s times two 10s. Well, that's going to be eight times 10 times 10, 800s. And then we say, what is seven times two? That is 14, which of course we can write the four, and then we can carry the one, so to speak. And I'll cross these out so I don't get confused. And then six times two is going to be equal to 12 plus this one that we had carried is 13. So there we go. And then we just have to add everything up. And we are going to get six plus zero ones is six. Two 10s plus four 10s is six 10s. Two 100s plus eight 100s is 10 100s, which you could do as zero 100s and 1,000. 1,000 plus zero 1,000 plus 4,000 is 5,000. Two 10,000s plus three 10,000s is going to be five 10,000s. And then we just have 100,000 right over there. So we've got 155,066. And we are done.
