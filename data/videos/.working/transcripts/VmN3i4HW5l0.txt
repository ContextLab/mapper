Take a look at these beautiful pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the reasons why it's beautiful is because of these nice streaks that you get for all the stars. But why do you get them? Now if you're thinking that this effect happens because you're taking a photo in space, well let's think again because I tried that home. This is the video that I'm taking from my balcony and you can see some of these street lights over here. Now I put the mosquito net and what do you find? Similar streaks! You can also see this effect if you squint your eyes. So what's going on over here? To get to the bottom of this we need to explore what happens when light hits an obstacle. That's it. That's the goal of this video and it sounds pretty straightforward but as we'll see it's pretty interesting and involved so let's figure this out. So what happens when light hits an obstacle? Well imagine we have a flashlight and we keep some objects as some kind of a coin in front of it. Then we know what's going to happen. It's going to cast a shadow over here. We're gonna get a shadow of the coin over here and we're gonna see the light somewhere over here if this was a wall like this. Which means if you draw the rays of light then the obstacle just blocks the light over there and everywhere else the light just travels straight. That's what happens right? Right? Well this is true if you have very big objects but would it be the same if we have very tiny objects in front of you know a source of light? Let's do an experiment to figure this out. Here my friend has a green laser light and we're gonna point it at the wall. What do we see? Well we see a big dot as we would expect but now let's put a hair strand in front of it. A hair strand has a very tiny thickness so what would we now see in front of it? Well my expectation would be the same dot as before but maybe with the shadow of the hair in between. Okay let's look at it. We don't see that. Oh my god what do we see over here? We first of all notice the same dot in the center but now we also see some streaks over here. It looks like light is somehow spreading out. How does it make any sense? What's going on? Why does light behave so differently when we have very tiny objects? Well to answer this question we need to recall that light is a wave and if you use a wave model maybe it'll all make sense but since we don't have any experience with light as a wave let's use water. So here's a Google map image of some waves water waves entering or hitting islands below. So waves are coming down. Now let's look at what happens once the waves hit and what the waves look like over here. So let me unhide this. What do you notice? You notice some circular ripples over here. That's very interesting. Can you see that? The reason why it's interesting is because if you draw the incoming waves it's kind of horizontal. You can see it right? So here's the horizontal waves. My expectation was that when the waves hit the island well below the island there should be no waves and over here the waves should just pass through. So this is what I thought should happen but that doesn't happen. You still see some waves over here. Let me show them. We still see some waves over here. We have some waves over here. Why do we have those waves over there? Why are waves over here? How does it make any sense? Well let's think about it. Let's think about it. What are waves actually? Waves are disturbances that gets propagated from one set of particles to another. Now if you have particles over here they go up and down and then they go up and down they make the particles next to them go up and down. Now there are no more water particles over here for them to go up and down so there will be no water waves over there. But look at what happens when a particle of this particular wavefront goes up and down. When it does that not only will it go, will it make a particle in front of it go up and down but it will also make a particle somewhere over here go up and down because it's in contact with that particle. It's putting a force on the particle in its vicinity and that's why waves will not just go like this straight down. The waves will kind of bend around the obstacle. The same thing will happen over here. The waves will kind of bend around the obstacle. In fact if I were to show the direction in which the waves are traveling, let me do that. So here is how the waves are coming in. They're coming in the direction of the waves is perpendicular to the direction of the wavefront. Okay we expect the waves to just go like this but that's not all they do. The waves that are over here kind of bend inwards. So we have this inward bending that's happening. Okay so this phenomenon where you know the waves bend around the obstacles. We give a name to it. We call it diffraction. This sounds very similar to refraction which also is a bending of wave but it's very different. Refraction was bending of waves when they change medium because when change medium the speed changes and that's what causes the bending of the wavefronts. This is different. This is diffraction with a D. Here the waves are bending not because they're changing medium. There's no changing medium, there's no changing speed but they're hitting an obstacle. Whenever waves hit an obstacle they will bend around the obstacle. That phenomena is what we call diffraction and it's a wave phenomenon. It applies to any waves hitting any obstacles. So if it applies to water waves it should also apply to sound waves and it will apply to light waves. But wait if light also shows diffraction which means light also bends around the obstacles then we shouldn't be seeing shadows right. I mean if this was light waves this was light rays coming from the top and there were some obstacles over here this would be the region of the shadow. From our daily experience we know that this would be the shadow but according to diffraction light should bend and enter into the region of the shadows which means we shouldn't be seeing shadows but we do. We don't this doesn't seem to happen in our daily life. Why is that? That's an interesting question. For that let's see how the size of the obstacle plays a role over here. So we have some incoming light waves over here. Imagine plain waves moving to the right. Now if we keep some small obstacle in between we would expect to get a shadow over here and the waves just pass it like this but we saw that doesn't happen. Waves will bend, they will diffract and so the waves would look kind of like this okay and so if you were to draw the rays of light they would bend like this which means if this was light then and if we kept a screen or some kind of a wall over here we should get something like this and this is what I was talking about. So because of diffraction light should enter into the region where we would get a shadow and so we should get a very tiny shadow right but that doesn't happen. Why is that? Well that's because over here look at the length of the object. The length of the object is comparable comparable to the wavelength of the waves right. Now what would have happened if this object was much bigger? Well the bending would still look the same because the waves don't care about like how big the object is. However if we now keep a much bigger object you can see that the waves still bend, the waves still diffract the same amount but now the shadow size is much more comparable to the size of the object itself. Not as dramatic as we saw over here. Now even here you can see the length is kind of like I don't know maybe 15 times bigger than the wavelength. What if this object was a thousand times bigger than the wavelength? Then this shadow size would be almost the same size as this one. This bending would be almost inconsequential and that's what happens in our daily life. You see the wavelength of light is of the order of 0.5 micrometers. That's 10 to the power minus 6 and the objects that we're dealing with in our daily life are like tens of thousand times bigger. So big that we can completely neglect the diffraction, the consequences of diffraction and that's why we don't think about it most of the times. So when objects are much bigger than the wavelength of light well the effects of diffraction are negligible. But if they are small enough like when you consider a hair strand, a hair strand is still of course bigger than the wavelength of light but there it's much more it's much more considerable compared to the wavelength of light. Now we will see the effects of diffraction. So here is the green laser that my friend was using. Now if we keep a small obstacle this is the hair strand. You can imagine like you know this you're looking at the hair strand from the top so this is the diameter of the hair strand you can imagine. So if you had kept the hair strand over here this is what we would expect if we didn't think about diffraction but now we know that incoming waves would bend over here downwards and the incoming waves over here would bend upwards which means you would now understand that this ray would actually bend down, this would bend up so you get something that looks like this. And so now if we had a screen very close to the hair strand then we would still see some shadow over here we would still we'll see some light over here but what happens if I keep the screen farther far away if I keep the screen far enough eventually now I'll find that the waves have spread out I will see that laser spreading out over the wall and that's exactly what we saw. Look when my friend keeps the paper very close to the laser the spreading out is not that much but as she keeps that as she takes the paper farther and farther and farther away now the spreading out is much more pronounced and eventually on the wall it just spreads out a lot. Now this is the pattern that we get because of the vertical hair strand light falls onto it and gets bent around giving you horizontal streaks so the vertical hair strand gives you horizontal streaks like this okay and you can see the gaps in between we'll talk about that in a second but what happens if I had another hair strand a horizontal hair strand like this well then that would give me vertical streaks along with the horizontal streaks so if that had happened then I would have gotten another vertical streaks like this and look this is the same shape as we saw earlier and now it makes sense as to why the mosquito net which has crosshairs like this gives you that streaks that we saw earlier. What about the Hubble? Hubble images? Well Hubble images gets the streaks because if you look at the well the Hubble space telescope here's a schematic of it it has two mirrors it has a primary mirror on which all the light gets reflected and it gets focused on a secondary mirror this is how the telescope works it's called a reflecting telescope now the secondary mirror has to be held in space over here right it can't just hover over there to keep it over there to support it we have these struts and look at the shape of the struts it's kind of like the crosshair of the mosquito mosquito net sorry that we had and that causes the streaks this crosshair will cause a streak like this and this one this strut will cause a streak like this beautiful right but the final question is why did we see if I were to carefully why did we see some dark spaces in between why do we see that for that let's go back to the laser and this time let's draw the wave fronts because we really need to look at the waves now so since the laser is moving to the right the wave is moving to the right the wave fronts are parallel this way they don't just end like this the wave front actually continues but then the intensity becomes much lower as you go farther away so it kind of like fades out that's how you can think about it and now if you keep an object over here the waves will bend and become sort of circular as we saw with the eye lens over there so something similar happens over here so let me draw that so the wave from the top bends down like this kind of bending down and the waves from the bottom bend up and when they do that look they mix with each other they interfere with each other and something very interesting thing happens now in order to do that I have only drawn wave crests over here but in between wave two wave crests we also see wave troughs so let's also draw wave troughs over here and I've drawn that with dotted lines and I know it looks like a complete mess right now but if we zoom in and we focus over here we will now see some interesting regions of intersection look over here first you can see crests are meeting up with other crests and troughs are meeting up with other troughs what happens over here you get much bigger wave you get a much bigger crest and you get a much bigger trough peaks on peaks valleys on valleys gives you bigger peaks and bigger valleys we call them constructive interference so over here the light intensity would be much higher along this region but this is not the only region where we'll get it let me actually draw all the regions where we'll get constructive interference in fact along this region you can see constructions happening again over here you can see crest trough on trough crest on crest trough on trough crest on crest you get constructive interferences so these are the regions where you get bright spots but in between constructive interferences you will also see regions where the peaks line up with the valleys peaks line up with the valleys peaks line up with the valleys can you see that dotted lines and the non dotted lines meet each other so these are the regions where they destroy each other when peaks and valleys meet each other they destroy each other you get almost no light intensity and that causes the darkness in between and you can find that in between over here as well you can actually see it over here you can see over here here so again let me draw all the regions where you see darkness this is what we would get so the red lines are where you get darknesses and the green ones are where you get the brightest spots and so if i had to keep a wall over here this is what you would get you would get bright spots over here and then you would get dark spots sorry dark spots in between where the red line is there and of course as you go farther away from the center the intensity just decreases because you're going farther and farther away from the light source and therefore you have the maximum intensity at the center and the light just gets dimmer and dimmer and that explains the dark bands over here so the complete pattern is because of both diffraction which makes the light spread out and due to interference of light now of course there are a lot of waves interfering so things are actually much more interesting but you can kind of sort of now see why wherever destructive interference happens you will get these dark spots
