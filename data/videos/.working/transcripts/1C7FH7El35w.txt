Hello everyone, good evening. I'd like to welcome you to the talk by MIT Club of Northern California. Tonight we have an excellent distinguished speaker, but before we introduce him, I hope you enjoy the sandwiches and cookies. We learned to make those ourselves by watching one of the sales videos. Just kidding, but we're here on the subway. Let me read a bio for Sal. Sal is a social entrepreneur who has become an internet sensation and inspiration for his fun and highly effective educational videos on YouTube. Every month more than 100,000 students, both young and old, across the globe uses over 1,300 free videos to learn about arithmetic, finance, chemistry, and vector calculus. He founded the Khan Academy, which was recently covered on CNN, PBS News, NPR, San Francisco Chronicle, and ABC Nightline. His mission is nothing short of creating a free and world-class virtual school for anyone in the world. He will speak about his experience starting the Academy and the massively transformational changes in learning and teaching that he thinks are inevitable in the next 5 to 10 years. Sal graduated from MIT in 1998 with computer science and math degrees and received his MBA from Harvard Business School. He left his day job as a hedge fund analyst in 2009 to dedicate full-time to his nonprofit academy. We are delighted and honored to have this distinguished speaker tonight in emerging giant in the online education space, a world-class educator, a dynamic communicator, and a selfless good-doer. Can you all hear me? I'd prefer to be closer to you all. Can you hear me in the back? Just like Ed said, I'm Sal, founder and faculty of the Khan Academy. I really want to make this a fun conversation. I don't want this to be me at the PowerPoint for the whole hour. I really want you all to raise your hand and ask me questions and we can take this wherever we want to go because there are a couple of different conversations we can have. Maybe we can have them all. For those of you all, how many of you have watched the Khan Academy video? That's a pretty good card. Just so you know what it is, and to get a sense of the growth, Ed said 100,000 when he first asked me to do this, it was 100,000. It's 200,000 unique students a month and it's only been two months. It is the fastest growing open course effort. It actually passed up, I'm a little competitive, it passed up MIT recently in terms of being the most used. It's getting about 60 or 70,000 video views a day. It has close to 16 million views on YouTube. One of the things we can talk about is maybe why it might be something about the content, how it's delivered and whatnot. We can talk about all of that. This is the site, just so for those of you who have never seen it. We can also debate my user interface skills for just putting all 1400 links on one page. Those are the videos. If you click on a random video, if you want a review of eigenvectors and eigen spaces, you can click there. We can let it load up or whatever. That's the Khan Academy. The sound isn't different than what you're hearing right now. You see this and you hear my voice and you don't see me. This will give you a flavor for the form factor. That could be a conversation we could have about why this is an interesting form factor or why I did it in all of that type of thing. I'm going to focus on, because I think most people are familiar with the video libraries. It has this reach, it's gotten popular, it's growing 10 or 15% a month at this point. I want to talk about the bigger vision. Ed had talked about this idea of starting a virtual school for the world. Videos are a start. They're the lecture part of a school. But a real school has to be more than just video. You have to have interaction with other people, you have to have practice, you have to have assessment, you have to have data. That's what I want to talk about. I'm genuinely open to ideas. This is a work in progress. Some of it is starting to be built. Hopefully over the next few months it will be built in a much bigger way. Some volunteers have come out of the woodwork very recently to supercharge some of these efforts. It's exciting times. Let me get the presentation up. A good number of y'all saw the videos. How many of y'all saw the web application on the site? That's a much lower penetration rate. Just so you know a little bit of the history, and I'm happy to go into this as much as you want. I started doing this remotely tutoring cousins. I was in Boston. My cousins were in New Orleans. She was having trouble with units. I said, after your school, my work, let's get together virtually. We'll use Yahoo! Doodle. It will be a shared notepad that we can each see what each other is writing. I got her a little Wacom pen tablet. I had one for myself. We just do conference calls. That's how I started. She started doing really well. I started tutoring her brothers, other cousins. Then a couple of things happened. I usually go straight to the videos because that's what it's known for. Being a computer science geek, I didn't even think of doing the videos at first. I said, hey, you know what? I'm going to write soft. I'll give them these little lectures. Then I would point them to random websites. I'd say, there's a cool applet on that website over there. Why don't you try it out and tell me tomorrow whether you're able to do those exercises or use that website over there. I got really frustrated. This piecemeal website here says, I'm going to write a couple of JavaScript, little things that will generate problems for them. It's not like just ten problems. It may come up with some random numbers and give them as many problems as they need. I made a bunch of these modules. I'll show you what the modules look like. This is what a module is. This is like a multiplying decimals module. We can go into as much depth on these as you want. I started making these little JavaScript modules for them. It was starting really where she was at units and basic algebra and adding and subtracting negative numbers and basic linear equations. Then I said, but gee, I don't trust. I say, hey, Nadia, did you do the problems? How many did you do? She said, oh, yeah, I did them. I did them. I said, come on. I did the problem. I was like, I'm going to put a database behind this thing. I put a database behind it so I could keep track of when she did the problem, how long it was it taking her, how many times was she doing, how frequently was she getting one right or one wrong. Then I started making the model. On that first slide right there, each of these circles is a module. Literally, the first module, this was a very organic process. It was really just me working with my cousins and iterating and saying, it would be nice to have the data. Then I started making modules here one off. I would at first just point them to it. Then after a while, I was like, well, there's some kind of dependency here. Nadia got that, but she needs help with that. To fill in that gap, let me make another module. Then after a while, I got tired of having to assign the modules. I said, well, it should automatically assign the modules because once she gets 10 in a row and this, she's ready for this, this, and this. I created this internal dependency in the little app to do this. I said, well, this is a neat graph. This is what I was using just to keep track of the modules. I just exposed this to the students so they know what's going on. This started well before I made the first video, but it's kind of like the secret of the Khan Academy, so you're getting a little tidbit. I think it's also the future on a lot of levels. This right here, this is literally level one edition. It's literally one plus one. If you go to the website, there is literally a video on adding one plus one. It's almost a joke that I made the video on adding one plus one, but the whole idea besides being cute is to give people the notion that, look, no matter how basic your skills, you can go to the site and you will find something that fits your need and the idea that when you see one plus one on the same page as vector calculus or on the same, you're like, gee, there's just like a ... I just have to step through that thing and I can get to vector calculus. There's not some mysterious ... and it's the same dude who's going to take me through the whole time. My kindergarten teacher is teaching me vector calculus. What's more? So you get 10-row. Once this was made, then it started to make ... This became what a lot of people in education talk about, differentiated learning with data and all of that. It kind of made me pause and say, well, this is working for my cousins, but there was actually one piece that was missing and that was kind of the ... I still had to do ... when I first started it, I thought, oh, it randomly generated these problems, pick random numbers here, and then when you click hint, it would show you the exact steps for that problem. I was like, oh, that's all you need to learn how to do a problem. You just need the exact steps for that exact problem. This will work for my cousins. But it didn't ... I mean, it would help them if they kind of knew how to multiply decimals already, but it didn't kind of get them over that hurdle. I still had to do that one-on-one session with them remotely, and that became hard to scale. Literally another buddy from MIT, who were ... dinner, he's like, why don't you make YouTube videos? Why don't you ... the thing that you do with your cousins, why don't you just record that on YouTube? I was completely dismissive of the idea first. I was like, oh, that's so silly. I have this software. It generates problems dynamically. It's got hints. What's a YouTube video going ... he's like, oh, yeah, you're right. You know, it's probably a stupid idea. I went home and I was like, well, you know, maybe there's something to it. Literally, when I kept recording videos with my ... I would do the 10th lecture on negative numbers with a new cousin. I was like, yeah, maybe a YouTube video will make sense. So I made the first YouTube video on greatest common divisor and this and that, and then ... I've said this in talks before. The immediate feedback I got from my cousins was that you are better on YouTube than you are live. The point, I think, that he was trying to communicate is it had none of the pressure of a traditional tutoring session. Did you get this? You're staring at the person. I'm like, oh, yeah, maybe I did. They're giving you bad information because they didn't get it. They feel bad pausing or repeating me, but they can do all they want with a YouTube video. Or they could go to Wikipedia or they might be afraid of even admitting that they don't know how to borrow or regroup or whatever. But now they can actually review it in kind of these one-off videos. And then other people start watching it as well and say, hey, there's something there. And on top of that, I incorporated with this because that was the whole point in the first place. If you've never seen this concept before, you at least have this outlet, these YouTube videos that you could somehow access. But before I go into the depths of this, I want to... Once this was built, then I had this, like, this seems to be working, but let's compare it to what goes on right now in the school system. And if you think about it, we're all... The whole conversation about education right now is all about the student-teacher ratios, how can we make the inner-city poor schools look a lot like the fancy rich schools, give people computers. And no one is fundamentally questioning the model. And if you really think about the model itself, I don't want to taint your opinion before... It's bizarre. You have this situation. You go into the classroom and you're all in a room together. And we'll talk about what you could do if you're all in a room together, but there's no interaction. It's just like this broadcast lecture, especially once you get to the university level. Even in the classroom, in middle school, there might be a little one question here or there, but fundamentally it's a broadcast lecture to the room. The teacher is pretty much guaranteed to lose half the students or bore half the students. At some point they're going to switch the whole time. You do that, then you go home. The student has to go home, do their homework. They do it in a complete vacuum. They have a textbook. Every other problem might be there's a solution in the back. You don't know why you got it right or wrong, anything. A complete vacuum, if you don't have anyone to help you, if you're lucky, you might get a tutor or your parent might be able to help you. Then you go to class the next day and there might be some type of review of homework, but really no real feedback. And the cycle repeats itself. You get another lecture. Then you go back home, you do homework in a vacuum, and this whole time you don't know what you're doing. The teacher has no data, nothing. That occurs for a couple of days. And then bam, you have an assessment. And then on the assessment, some students get 50%, 80%, 70%, 90%. The good students get 95%. Next concept. Even if you fail an exam, the class moves on. You don't know half of the subject, half of the material in that previous concept, and the class is going to move on. And you might say that failing students are bad, the A students are alright, but they still didn't know 5% of the concept. And maybe it was a careless mistake, but maybe they didn't know what happens when you take something to the zeroth power. Maybe they didn't know exactly what a fractional exponent was, that one problem on the exam with a fractional exponent. And that A student, the one who's getting that positive label, when they go to calculus and they see that, what are they going to do? They're not going to get 95%, they're going to get 90%, because they're going to miss that and another concept. And then when they go on, and that's not even to mention about the 50%, right? The first time you get assessment is when it's time to move to the next concept. In no way is it actionable. So if you really think about the process, it's just this huge filtering mechanism. It's just this process where we're just trying to, every step of the way, we're just knocking more and more people off. And the lucky people in this room, the people who happened to be lucky enough, that we were assessed and filtered at the right place at the right time. And that led to us feeling really smart and going on and doing on. I mean, that's the way it works. It makes you really question, we're all lucky. That's the big takeaway. So what's happening here, what I think is happening here, is that whole cycle, it's all happening instantaneously with every interaction. The instruction, if you've never seen multiplying decimals before in your life, you click watch video, it pumps in from YouTube. And you can imagine, you know, there's one or two videos right now, but eventually you have ten videos. You're tracking whether the person watched the video. You can eventually track whether they paused or repeated where they watched. And I'll talk more about that later on, how you can perfect the content. So they get the instruction there. Then they can do the practice. So you're getting the practice. And you get immediate feedback. You get it, you know, did I get it right or wrong? If you don't know how to do it, you get the exact steps for that problem. And then you're also getting assessment, because every time you do a problem, it's tracking everything about that. How long you did it, how long it took you, you know, how many times did you click hint? And then the paradigm here, and I literally did this just on a whim. I was like, well, you know, how do I know if someone really knows something? I was like, you know, it's not 90 percent, or it's not 95 percent. Just keep doing it until you get ten in a row. Ten in a row should be the paradigm. Because then, and that will kind of enforce a certain level of discipline. I mean, people say, oh, isn't that, you know, kind of, but no, but like, when you take the SAT, you know, you can't make those little careless mistakes. You should enforce a certain level of precision. So I just threw out ten in a row, and it doesn't have to be ten in a row. It could be five in a row, or whatever, depending on the concept. But if you think about what's happening when you enforce it, you don't allow that 95 percent student to move on while not knowing that five percent, and then only get lost in the next topic. So that's the general idea. This right here is the, this is just another example of a module. This is slope of a line. If you don't know how clearly you do, you know, it draws things for you. But it's just another indication of, and all of this is live. You can go right now to conexercises.appspot.com, and you can try out all of this stuff. And I encourage you, if you have friends or family members, there was even a guy at the hedge fund I worked with who was going to take the GMAT, and you know, he was like sumo cum laude from Yale, and he's like, oh, you know, what should I use for math? I was like, you should use this. I was like, hey, but this is starting to be a one plus one. I was like, just do it. Two weeks later, he's like, that was good. That was amazing how long many people have in multiplied decimals. So that's kind of the self-paced student kind of view of the world. And we'll talk about how we can, because I still haven't given you the whole virtual school. Right now we're talking about videos, and then we've kind of automated the self-directed learning, and learning at your own pace, and getting assessed. But then you have to think about, well, how can you incorporate that with the human experience? You know, you're coming into a room together to essentially learn how can you use this technology to hypercharge that type of thing. Actually, even before I even talk about this, there's actually a very simple flipping of the classroom that I think should occur tomorrow. You don't even need any of this software, because the videos already exist. And some teachers, it wasn't my idea, a teacher in London said that he is now, and if you think it's actually a no-brainer, I don't understand why this doesn't happen worldwide tomorrow. He is now assigning the lectures for homework, and he's having the students do homework in the classroom. There's no other technology necessary. And think about what happens there. Think about what happens there. Right now we all gather at seven in the morning in 10 to 50, you know, we're all with our peers, and we're looking at, and we just have to sit passively, and just get this broadcast lecture. And then we go off our own, and we do these problem sets in a vacuum. If you flip the model, and the lecture, as we said, is one size fits all, I might be lost or bored, I might have gaps from the last lecture, I didn't understand, but I still have to get this exact lecture. You flip the model, you get on-demand video at home, you know, when you're ready for it, when you're awake, when you get, it's actually, I got a letter from a student about, they actually have a good calculus teacher, but he, two rows in front of him, this really cute girl, is, is, and every day he's just trying to figure out how he can ask her out, and he missed like two months of calculus. And this was his only out, but but that, I mean, that's another, but the, I say that's a story of another person. That is another. We all had similar stories, I think. But when we go home, and we do these problem sets in a complete vacuum, we have no one to help us. But if you flip it, you can watch things at your own pace, fill in your gaps, do whatever you need. And then when you're in the classroom, you have 30 or 40 or 400 of your peers to help you. And you have the professor who can walk around and in real time, see how people are doing before, you know, two weeks before the assessment, two weeks before everyone gets that label placed on their head that they got a B, their B student there, which is, if you really think about it kind of silly, and I'm not like this touchy, you know, there are these people who are anti grades, and it's kind of like, oh, that's touchy feely, you know, we should know I'm anti grades, because I think it's ridiculous. It's not about it's because if you don't, if you're a B student, you should, everyone should be forced to be an A student, it's on that concept. It's silly, you know, you'll meet many, many people. And I think this room is an exception. But you'll meet many, many people who went through algebra, algebra two, geometry, pre calculus, trigonometry, calculus. And when they see an algebra problem in their front of their face, they don't, they don't see it. It's just they have no, they never had mastery of anything in between. And this whole exercise of going from, you know, going from one hoop to the next and being an A- student the whole way, it's just a, it's just an exercise and filtering. It's not an exercise in actually making people have, have tangible skills that they can, they can do something productive with. But that, you know, when I just described flipping them out, that's if you have no technology. But what if you have the technology, what you can do is teach you, this was, this is, there's a bunch of students that are going to do the same thing. They're going to do the same thing. It's not that they do, they're going to do the same thing. And you know, if you have a student that's going to do the same thing, you know, they're going to do the same thing. And then they have the same kind of names here that you can't see, I blanked them out. But this is a report that a teacher could have, and this is actually a real report, this is, you know, like a Photoshop version. This was done in a summer camp where they used what I showed you in the last couple slides as their, their, their math curriculum, where every student was able to work at their own base. And the teacher walks in every day. Each column here is one of those modules that you saw in that first slide, is one of those concepts. And each row here is a student. Green means that the student already got 10 in a row in that concept. They, they did it. They're cool. Purple means that they're working on it right now. That they're, you know, that's kind of their frontier of learning at the moment. But everything seems to be going okay. And then red, red means, you know what, that students done like 50 problems. I mean, some kind of, you can think of the heuristic. That students done 50 problems. 95% of students who've done 50 problems in that module usually move on. The student has not. So some type of intervention should occur. Some type of human intervention. So a teacher could look at this, and either they could eyeball it. They could say, hey, look, everyone's doing fine, but these two kids, you need help in level two division. Let me just, let everyone else work at their own base. Let me just take these two students aside and do a very intimate focus intervention on just those two students. Or even better, you could pair these two students up with these two students up initially. And see if that gets them over the hurdle. And then, and you can actually capture the data before and after that. I'm not there yet, but if the software is actually scheduling the interactions, you can actually see what happens before those and start to rate teachers and students and all of that type of thing. And slowly work up, slowly work up to the level of the teacher. So what I do, what I think should happen, and I hope that this kind of catalyzes it, is we go back to a one room schoolhouse. We go back to a room full of people from kindergartners all the way to anybody. Senior citizens who want to come back and learn. And they're all working at their own pace. And if you have trouble with a concept, and even if you don't know, this will know that you're having trouble with a concept. It will pair you with somebody else. And it'll know about that interaction. It'll know how good of an instructor that person was before and after you'll rate them, you know, whatever else. And then you can keep escalating up and up the ladder until eventually you can get by the paid teacher. So you can actually have a reality. And obviously, there's a huge aspect of actually teaching people for retention. I mean, this isn't just a way to get economics and scale. This whole mechanism, I'm a ninth grader, and I'm teaching the sixth grader negative numbers. That by itself is a hugely powerful tool. I mean, I'm learning things better than I ever learned before just doing these videos. You can imagine if you're, and this whole level of maturity. I think actually, if you hang out with people older and younger than yourself, you actually act more mature for a whole set of reasons. But then all of a sudden, you have a model where everyone is learning, the classroom is actually an interactive experience. It's no longer a passive experience. Everyone is operating exactly at the level that they need to. And it actually scales. You can actually make it economic. You could actually have, you know, people, everyone's obsessed with student teacher ratios. But student teacher ratios assume a model that, that, you know, if there's one of me and 10 of you, then we can have a conversation. If there's one of me and 20 of you, we're gonna have less of a conversation. One of me and 100 of you, we're not gonna have a conversation. And that's true. To some degree, but here, everyone works at their own pace, even if there's 100 students and one paid tutor, because you have this interaction, I'm willing to bet that you're gonna have a better interaction with that one paid teacher who cannot be paid 100 grand a year instead of, you know, what teachers get paid. You're gonna have a better interaction in this world with 100 to one teacher, teacher, student ratio, then you'll probably get in. And even the, you know, the, the, the fanciest private schools that there are right now. This right here, this is literally like, you know, the, the, the school, the, the summer program had asked me about this and I was curious about myself. This was literally me just doing SQL queries in the data, you know, every night when I got, went from the summer camp. But, you know, it's not like a rigorous study, but to me it kind of speaks to the power of every student working at their own pace and, and kind of throws into question the notion of our traditional notions of assessment, which we, I think, sense are kind of, are shaded to begin with. So what this chart is doing, this is, this axis right here is the days of the summer camp. So it was a six week program. And this is just a count of the modules completed. And this is black line right here. That's the class mean, the class average. So if you say on day seven in this class of 30 or so students, the average student had completed 23 modules. That's what that tells us. And then, you know, and so you can actually even see that they all started one plus one, which is actually an interesting idea. Because we started a, another group, not at one plus one. And some group, some subset of the students always got stuck. They just never moved on. Even though we started them in fifth grade and they were seventh graders, some subset always got stuck. When we saw when we started everyone at one plus one, no one got stuck. Which tells you that there are some small people who have some gaps and it never gets addressed otherwise. So you can have the best algebra teacher on the planet. You can have an innately very intelligent kid. But if he or she just is a little foggy on multiplying decimals, there's no hope. They're just going to talk past each other. And this is going to be a very frustrating experience. When you start everyone at one plus one and you see it here, it's kind of a very steep curve. This is kind of the review. This was the kids just getting a ten in a row, ten in a row, ten in a row. And then it starts to level out a bit. And this was kind of, you know, you can kind of see the learning happening. But the interesting thing, or at least the immediately interesting thing about this is the green lines are standard deviation above and below that mean. And you know, you can plot all the students here. But this student in particular, on day five, if you did like a pre-assessment for the class, if you did an assessment right here, she only completed 12 modules. More than one standard deviation below the mean. So if you were in a traditional, if you were tracking students, you'd say, oh, she's a remedial student. She's going to hold the class back. Or we have to hold the rest of the class back for her. She doesn't belong in here. All that. And you would put a big label on her forehead. You're never going to be an engineer. You know, all of these things are going to be placed on her. And it actually does happen around sixth or seventh grade. That is when these labels, you know, these careers get ruled out for students. But because she was able to spend a little, you know, and I was curious, I was like, what happened to her? And I could go into the data. And I could see exactly what she was doing. She was spending more time than everyone else on adding and subtracting negative numbers. And just to understand this chart right here, each bar, this is the first problem she did. Red is wrong, blue is right. And the height is how long it took her. So I mean, this is just from the data of the interactions. And so you can see she got a couple of questions wrong, that she maybe guessed one right. And you have this big long time. She actually watched the video here. I looked at the video log. She watched the video here. Then she got a couple more right. But then she still got a few wrong. So once again, in a traditional classroom, she would have, she would have been said, Oh, you know, at this point, you are an A student, you got nine out of 10 right, or you got, you know, 19 out of 20 right, you're an A student. But no, it forced her to keep going. A couple more right, one wrong, then finally, she got 10 in a row. And you can actually see that she also got faster on it. So there's a whole other element of speed, which, you know, doesn't matter on some standard. But once she got through that, once she was able to just kind of remediate herself and really build a strong foundation, she just raised it. This was just in six weeks, you went from being, I think the second to worst student in the class, if you want to measure that way, to the second or third best, all the students are chartier in just six weeks. So it makes you question, you know, if you did an assessment here, and I show that because she literally raised through level three linear equations, which is like, two x plus seven is equal to negative three x minus four. It's like, and she just thought it was intuitive after doing maybe level two, she just read, if you saw that, she'd say, Oh, she's gifted, she's destined to be. So it makes you really question and you know, we were just a lucky kids that got assessed at the right time, you got all the positive feedback. And you know, we were assessed at that point, then people get but there's there's probably a lot of people who might have been able to eat our lunch eventually, who got who got who got kicked off. So this, you know, I show this, this is data from YouTube, and it it's, I think, you know, everything I talked about before is how do you make sure a student learns properly? And how do you make sure that their foundation is built and how to use that data to optimize the actual physical interactions. But I show this to kind of show that, you know, there's another dimension of perfecting the actual content. So this is data that YouTube gives me, they, you know, they call this audience attention. And what they do is they measure the drop off rate off off of a YouTube video relative to the average YouTube video of that length. So let's say the average YouTube video at minute three has lost 40% of its audience. That's just a natural drop off rate, right? If I'm if I've lost at minute three, if I've lost 40% of my audience, I will be I'll be hugging the line right there. If I've only lost 20% of my audience, I'll be above average. So that's what they're measuring there. But you can imagine and actually, I've seen some a few of my videos where this curve does this, it just drops off. And I can go that exact minute in the video, I said orthogonality, and I never define orthogonality. And I can either rerecord the video, I could put a little bubble there, where you can get more information, or yeah, I mean, we're just, you know, you're getting real data that allows you to actually iterate and perfect on what you're producing. And you know, you can imagine two dimensions, this is attention, you can also have efficacy if you if you couple it with the actual exercise, and you keep iterating on it until you have kind of a gem of a video, and you can even have multiple people's videos, see what's better for different people. I mean, this all exists in like Netflix, there's no reason why it shouldn't exist in education. So this right here, this kind of the big picture, you know, I'm talking about like a virtual school for the world, this is what I think it's gonna be. And, you know, I'm open to any ideas or any kind of, you know, nuanced parts of it. But you know, you have your video library, that's kind of the low hanging fruit, it's the first line of instruction, you can pause it, repeat it. You know, one thing, I spoke to a journal of higher education recently. And you know, sometimes I'm very diplomatic, I really don't want to rock too many boats. But I was in like a quirky mood, and I hadn't eaten for a long time. I often don't eat for long periods of time. But, but I just went off, I was like, I challenge you, I checked because this is a journal read by like professors and educators, like, why does a 300 person lecture even exist anymore? Like, in what way? Like, just tell me one way that that is better than on demand video. Like, this is this, and I'm happy for any of you all to put, but there's no, I mean, it's this broadcast lecture to a room of people at a certain amount of time, this 90 minutes long, people have gaps in it. The professor sees blank faces, it's just this all around, you know, I think the only reason I exist is because people associated with a college experience. People expect when I pay 30 or $40,000, I should get this. That's the only in my mind, why it exists with online on demand video, you can pause repeated, the producer can create can can get data on what's working, what's not, you can get your best professors to produce the best content and keep iterating and making it better and better people can throw their gaps. So that's what the video libraries all about. Then you have the web applications. You saw one of them, but there's actually another one. And there's there's some gentleman in the back of the room who started working on it. There's a whole suite of web applications you can build for allowing people to learn at their own pace. What we what you saw was for math. We're working on something, you know, I'd be happy to talk about it. If y'all are curious, you know, for for kind of more, I guess, you know, fact based knowledge, you know, learning American history or geography, things like that. And you can even have web applications, you know, for peer assessment for creative writing all sorts of things. I mean, when you actually compose things for other people to review, it becomes a whole other level, whole other game than when you're writing something for a teacher to mark up and, you know, and say you're a plus and then throw it away. So there's a whole suite of web applications to build. And then on top of that, you use all of that data to actually facilitate peer to peer interactions. And, you know, I kind of hinted at in the classroom. But there's no reason why just has to be limited to the classroom. If I'm having trouble with quantum mechanics, and the best instructor for quantum mechanics is in Mexico City, and we're both free at 4pm. Eastern time, no reason that we can't set up an interaction with a pen tablet and not the way I used to do with my cousin Nadia and have an interaction even better record that interaction so that other people in the future can use it. I rate them based on how they were, they can even rate me how I was as a student. And then the system knows what I did before and after that interaction. So it actually knows what it was, whether it was a statistically significant intervention in some way. So this is the big picture. I mean, you can just keep getting the data and iterating and iterating and iterating it to make it a better solution. So that's, that's kind of the master plan. So any questions or yeah, I know you've got this initial focus of K through 12 and math and whatnot. Sorry, we can't hear the question. Okay, so one of the thing you said really struck me as an educator, which is your comment about everyone should be forced to be an a student. Right. So if you think about, you know, this is an org change exercise with a lot of unwilling institutions trying to get them to change. It seems to me that this idea, just this one idea would be very powerful to take. Into professional certification, say nursing degrees, right? Where you're not going to be a nurse, right? Until you achieve this level of competency in the exam. Take a profession where this idea that everybody does have to be an a student in order to have a career and get them to buy into this model and maybe get the resources from that sort of problem or that sort of field. Right. To test these ideas out and to show how they work or define the implementation or whatever. Well, you know, I think, I mean, I think it exists in professional development because people say, look, if you're a nurse and you don't know this, people are going to die. And so they do enforce that, you know, doctors, nurses and police, you know, that exists. And but it isn't, you know, you could do studies. But but I think, I mean, it's, it's, I think it's almost intuitive that, you know, if you go back to kind of the, you know, someone who has real mastery of algebra is going to be way more powerful than someone who has, you know, B minus student level of understanding of algebra through different. Like, you know, you know, you're going to be able to apply any of it as opposed to, I mean, I've worked at, you know, when I was working at a hedge fund, there, you know, I, there was once a CFO who said, you know, I was like, Oh, what's your incremental gross margin? He said, Oh, we don't divulge that. I was like, Well, you just gave it to me. I mean, you, you told me your, your gross profit in two periods and how many units you sold in two periods. That's your, and then, and literally everyone in the room was like, Oh my God, this is some kind of rocket science. That is algebra one. That is algebra one. And no one in the room, there are MBAs, there were PhDs in the room. They're very smart people, but no one could recognize. And that is a failure. And these are the successful people in our education. So people, people need to, I mean, if we had real mastery of algebra, the world would be a different place. All the calculus and all of that other stuff would just be, you know, for fun, but it's, it's not. So, so I mean, you know, I don't even think it has to be tested. I mean, if people really understood algebra, that's going to be way better than people, you know, halfway understanding algebra and then, and then moving on to, to other things. Yeah. Question about the peer to peer interaction. So do you see that happening now? Actually, if you have 16 million views on YouTube, I imagine there's comments and is there a kind of moderation happening? Yeah. So there's no moderate. So if you look at it, y'all can go home and look at some of the, the, the art, not debates or even some of the commentary on the YouTube videos are like what teachers would dream of having in their classroom. Like someone says, Hey, you know, this was a great video, but I don't quite get what Sal did at minute 234. There's a little link in YouTube. You can go right back to that little point in the video. And then other people say, well, come along and say, oh, you just have to watch that other video. And he explains that in depth. Or here's another page you could watch it, or they'll actually just explain it right there. And this is just on a simple message board. So it definitely already exists. And it's literally just, there's a lot of people, I get at least, you know, five emails a day asking for a better kind of community to tap into this. And I've just been waiting to kind of do it right. But it's there. And I mean, people love to help each other. And they just don't have a good way of doing it right now. I have children in the first grade, fourth grade. And what would you suggest I do with them first through four first and fourth? So, you know, like, and this is, you know, it's not scientific, I've tried out the app with different aged kids, like the one plus one, it is one plus one, but it doesn't have like dancing bears. But no, I hope to eventually have dancing. I mean, everyone likes dancing, you know, a kindergartner, but I found like kindergarten, I've seen some precocious second or third graders get into it. Like, they don't need the dancing bears and the music and all of that type of thing. So your fourth grader, I think could be could be, you know, ready for this. The videos, I've seen very young kids like them. They like the I don't know what they like about it. They like the black background and the colors and they respond to they respond to the videos. I've seen three or four year olds. It holds their attention. I don't know if they're retaining anything. So you might want to start with the videos for your younger student. And then but the fourth grader, I think is ready for the app. They I think younger kids go straight to the YouTube. Yeah, I think so. And you might want to watch it with them and kind of, you know, some people told me that they watch a couple of videos a night with their kids kind of replaced the bedtime story. Why not? So are your videos in your system a little too big for one laptop? So the question is, is your video in your system a little too big for one laptop per child? And I guess there's a couple in terms of just what getting any of that content into there. Because right now I think they're just doing a textbook kind of format, right? Yeah, so yeah, so the question is, is it too big for kind of getting the content into one laptop per child? And I mean, the easy answer is no. I mean, that, you know, when I first saw one laptop, one laptop per child, this was before Khan Academy was really well thought I was like, what are they going to do on that one laptop per child? You know, they're going to use it. And there's examples of people using it for lights and things, as opposed to, you know, for a computer. So I know I think it could be used tomorrow for one laptop per child. But did they have enough drive space and things like that? Yeah, so I, you know, I recent the raw videos, I they're going to be on iTunes, YouTube. And so I just talked to the Apple people and I handled them the disc that had all the raw videos. And then, you know, the non. And it was like 40 gigs. And I think if you took the flash versions, it's 10 megabytes, like 14 gigs. So I think I don't know how big the hard drives are those, but soon they're going to be able to store all that should be something you should look into. Yeah, that's a big deal. No, I would love to. I've, you know, if they call me up, I'd say, yeah. No, no, I hope they will. Yeah, yeah, no, I'd love to. I'd love to. And, you know, well, we can have another talk about, you know, one thing I've, I'm talking to a couple of foundations and, you know, what I'm talking is one laptop or tell awesome if there's the resources, but you don't necessarily need one laptop laptop for child get like some refurbished $200 PC put it in the village. Now, all of a sudden, you can have asynchronous learning, which is what these village kids need because they have to take off for the harvest. They have a whole spectrum. Some of them can't read some of them, you know, have a pretty reasonable proficiency. And that that that $200 that $200 refurbished PC instead of being one person student, you have 20 students per day working on it. Each half an hour a day doing this type of thing. And then as a foundation for the first time in like the history of philanthropic giving you'd actually have real data on what's happening in real time on the actual utilization of your assets, where students are how they're how they're performing. And then in terms of the actual costs, it's, you know, a $200 PC will last four years. So it's $50 a year and you're educating 20 students. That's $2 50 per student per year for an education, which is competitive with anywhere in the third world. It's cheaper than pencil and paper. So I think that's what should be the model, you know, but I think a lot of that's even better. Oh, in the back. I think you said you do all the videos and much yourself. Right. The first time I see how long is it taking put together a module? I mean, there's some topic areas, surely you don't know all of it. So there's got so that the module so the video, if it's like a work like, you know, there's probably people emailing me right now, like some album. I think I mean, inadvertently do some kids homework for them. But those type of things are just like an algebra problem. Someone emails it to me. It's like, Oh, you know, I haven't got that exact problem before. Let me just do it. That's literally, you know, the 10 minutes of the video plus five minutes double it's a very small amount of time. The if you saw that that first screen, I started doing world history videos. Those take a lot of What do you mean by a lot? I so when I started on the French Revolution, I spent like a week doing nothing but reading on the French Revolution. Like I literally just took time off and I like steep myself in the picture because you know, I think we've all found this when we were going to school is that when you're in the midst of a class, you really are an expert for that short period of time until the exam and you are an expert and it all goes away. So I really not, you know, so I, if that's your time, you can talk to any academic anywhere in the world and you know all the details and the nuances and everything. So, you know, about a week of our study, it's fun study, right? I'm not for an exam is for me and I get to make YouTube videos. So I'll do that and then I'll and then I'll start making the videos and then I can probably produce maybe two or three videos a day. Once once I have kind of the big picture, I understand the major pieces and I have a kind of a sense of, you know, if you watch those videos, it's literally I cut and paste a bunch of images and maps. I'm a big map person so I need that. Is the software that you use to do things like draw perfectly straight lines and doing the ratio something you can buy off the shelf at Fry's or did you design that all yourself? No, although some people have offered to pay for it but I didn't build it. So, so, and actually I don't. So all I use is a I started off using Microsoft paint as I made the background black and I used this thing called Microsoft paint. I used this thing called screen video record, which is like this shareware freeware $20 screen capture software. That's what I started the first probably four or five hundred videos were done like that. Then someone just sent me a Camcasia license. You need a better screen capture. So I started using Camcasia and then I use Smoothdraw 2 which is pressure sensitive. So it actually looks like I'm writing with a pen as opposed to Microsoft page. But it's all, you know, you could get set up for $200 at home with exactly what I have. It's all found stuff. There's probably better stuff out there. Like what I'm using right now, I can't draw a straight line with Microsoft paint. I could. This doesn't have a line tool. In line with your idea of this as entertainment. So placing good times for it. There's a niche for retirees. Any number of people who first thing in the morning do the crosswords in the Sudoku. Exactly. And Sudoku is the compass. No, I know. I know. I mean, my mother loves Sudoku. Oh, if you were algebra, that's so much better. I have gotten letters from retirees saying that they started doing it instead of Sudoku and the big, you know, other than, you know, keeping them sharp and, you know, they're not connecting with their grandkids. They're like becoming their grandkids tutor and this is a whole lot of level of connection that they never could have before. So there is something and there's, you know, and not the retirees. There's a lot of homeschooling parents are like now I can kind of, you know, I don't tap. I think there's a lot of homeschoolers are doing great until about algebra. And then they go to the next and this is kind of helping them out. Yeah, there's actually a lot of military. There's a lot of people who are surprised. There's a lot of military people, roughly my age, were going back to college who there's no if you think about if you're like in your mid 30s and you want to go back to college and the first thing you're going to see when you go to college. College algebra and there's nothing out there for you. There's no like I mean, you're helpless and this is the only thing that's out there and they're like eternally thankful that they could relearn arithmetic and algebra and all these things that they haven't seen for 20 years. So yeah, it's surprising. So I have an eighth grade there. And my question is, would you say that the videos sometimes could replace going back to the textbook when you get stuck or, you know, Yes. No, so the question and this is the textbooks. Oh, don't get me started about that. No, I will get started on textbooks. The question was, I have an eighth grader and you think the videos can replace the textbook and let's think about what a textbook is. There's two things in a textbook. There's something that claims to be some form of explanation. Right. That little two pages of text. And then it's exercises. Right. And there's like 50 problems and a couple of you know, I'm thinking the answer. I guarantee you on demand video, whether it's Khan Academy or anybody is going to be better than that. Prose or whatever you want to call it. That's trying to explain the concept and it's usually explain more for peer review more for the other textbook author saying, oh, yes, he did it rigorously. That's excellent. As opposed to the eighth grader who wants exactly 99. I think the people in this room were a small subset of people who could actually read a textbook. And that's what allowed you to probably get where we got because we could actually consume that information. But most people there. So on demand video is better than that. And from an exercise point of view, the textbook company doesn't know who's doing what exercise when who's watching what what's actually being effective. They're not getting real time data. That stuff I should. I mean, you can argue what the module should look like. But something like that is going to be infinitely better, especially if you can tweak it and get data on what's working. What are people using for all we know? The textbook publishers, you know, half of those problems are never touched by anybody. But they're in there and kids are getting hernia is carrying those problems around. So, yes, the answer is I think I think the textbooks are need to go. So for like world history, what kind of problems do you have there? Yeah, so so the question is for world history, what kind of problems can you put out there? So right now, like, yeah, so so for like what I showed you that those modules, that's good for something that can be like templatized that you can, you know, math, you can even do some some like physics problems like that, like the core problems you could do. Sometimes the chemistry, maybe genetics. But what about, you know, what were the causes of the Civil War? I just have like analysis of like a complex issue, you know, oh, yeah, so there's two levels of things like history. One is kind of the, you know, what did Millard Fillmore do, you know, there's that level. And then there's a level of, you know, let's talk about what, you know, the impacts of slavery today or something more nuanced, but the core stuff. And that's what I'm working on with those two gentlemen back there. I met them. Jay and just all at the back. They, they, we met like last week, you know, but what we're working on is a, you know, we're working on, you know, if we were studying for like a factual based thing, we would get together in a big study group and, you know, write flashcards for each other and then quiz each other on each other's questions. And so what we're working on is, you know, kind of a world, you know, if for American history, you put the whole curriculum there. And then if you say, you know, I'm gonna write a question on the antebellum period, you click antebellum, you write a question, you can embed a video image, whatever you want. Once you feel good about it, you put the correct choice and correct choices explanation. Once you feel good about it, you publish it. If I'm the first person to see your, your, your question, I'll say, hey, warning, this is an untested question. And all of that stuff, but you should try it out. I do the question, I read on quality, difficulty and importance. And then you start building this library of questions with metadata around it. And then you can imagine that you're collecting data on people who knew this question didn't know that question. So you can quantitatively say what's easier, what's harder. And then, I mean, there's all sorts of ways you can consume the question. You can imagine a teacher, because you're getting all of this data, right? You know exactly how long it takes for a certain type of student to complete a question, whether they get it right or wrong. You can have a, imagine a history teacher, once you have this huge, you know, data, this huge library of questions, like, you know what, I want to administer an exam to my history students department and bring them to the computer lab. I want 50 questions. And those, and no, and I don't want more than a 95% chance that more than two people aren't going to finish that exam. And we'll have all of the data, because it'll know for that level of student how many, how long it will take them. It'll be able to do the statistical model. And then, bam, it'll get, it'll be instantly graded, and you'll get the data, and it'll go into the, and it can have their students also write. So that's for like the core, and you can do that for anything. You can do that even for kind of more nuanced math problems, stuff that's not hard to democratize. The more nuanced stuff, you know, that's open ground. I'm open to ideas. You know, I think there's, there's, there's things, you know, a peer review of essays, you know, like, or you can argue, you know, you can have, you know, argue through essays and have people vote on whose arguments. I mean, there's all sorts of things you can do. That's a whole other, but that hasn't been, well, the foreign language, I was thinking you have a 15 month old, you know, Skype exists, like the best foreign language, just I'm gonna have him chat for half an hour a week with somebody in Mexico City, you know, Dubai, you know, Hong Kong, I mean, you know, and half an hour a week, and he'll just chat, he'll speak, you know, that's foreign language, like, that's, I mean, I think there's some very simple things with found technology right now that, that, that could solve some of these problems. And that'll be a version as opposed to, you know, okay. I'm very curious to hear your thoughts about Texas Board of Education. So have you heard about the Texas Board of Education? Oh, the Texas Board of Education. They're trying to rewrite the textbooks. Yes. I'm wondering whether that sort of made you re rethink about your mission with Konakai. Oh, yeah. So that's interesting. So I have an interesting story. So that's where the Texas Board of Education, you know, the rewriting American history and all that. Well, you know, from a personal level, that's the power of this thing. Like, I can all of a sudden get it. So I do every now that I go on Google blog search and I see who's using these kind of videos, obviously, it's a lot of homeschoolers and all that, but actually a white supremacy group loves the kind of category. And, you know, because of like, this is quality instruction, our kids aren't getting it. This is the only way that they're going to be able to compete with the Asians and the Jews. But what's happening is, I mean, sadly, there's no way they could have forgotten me to teach them or they would have let me get into their house and teach their kid. But because they recognize that this is better than what they're getting in the school, I'm able to get into those kids' heads, which would have never, never, never debate whether that's a good thing. But I think that whole Texas thing, I think it's a non-issue. I think with the internet and all of that, I think people can debate night and day over what should be in the textbook. No one's going to care at the end of the day. It's because they're going to get information from other sources. I think the reality is most of the kids aren't learning what they're trying to put in their books. Are you able to, different people learn in different ways. And so, for example, some people might learn with examples and other people want to learn more deductively. Can you identify the ways that people learn and then adjust the instructions to match the perspective? So the question was, can you adjust to deductive learners versus people who need examples? We could. I don't do it yet. I don't think that it's already done and all of that. But it definitely could be done. And that's the other value of this. Some people say, are you teaching it this new way with regrouping? Are you teaching the old way with borrowing? Are you teaching the abstract, manipulative way? Are you teaching the robo? I think, let's do both. Let's do both. And people can pick and choose what they want or do both. In a traditional classroom, you have to make these decisions because you have a scarce amount of time, scarce amount of resources. You have to say, teach it this way or that way. But here, just teach it both ways. Teach it the deductive way and then do a ton of examples because that's the way most people enjoy it. There's nothing to stop you from doing it. I saw the graph earlier where you show how you get from the addition one all the way through. And that's how the brain works to build on top of foundations. And you can extend that even further by anything that's factual, taking history of geographies. By taking the Wikipedia graph of links, for example, you could imagine after you just learned about the French Revolution and a lesson about French geography, you could then be used to doing that. And you could be offered to take a look at the Chateau D'Herca, for example. And since you've learned about the Chateau D'Herca, you could learn about neocastasis and architecture. And the system could automatically get you through a network of knowledge that you can always relate to something you already know. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Your level's bottom ahead. No, but I agree with that. Especially once you have a question library and you just think about the best way to navigate right now, it's just a curriculum you can say I want to learn about the French Revolution. But this will kind of can organically, what you're suggesting, and there's no reason why I haven't built it. But it can be built today. And it's kind of silly that it's not being built, especially considering how leverageable something like that is. I thought about teaching parents, educators, teachers on how to teach, how to communicate effectively to your audience, how to troubleshoot with the hang ups. Yeah. So I thought about teaching to educators and parents. So there's an interesting story there too. Like this was when Khan Academy was like, you know, I was like happy if anyone called me and it's probably just legitimate. So it's like literally three years ago, Miami Dade contacted me said, can we use your videos for teacher training? I was like, yeah, yeah, sure. That's awesome. That's like, wow, like, y'all are like real educators and y'all want to use my videos. I was like, but why don't you let the students use them too? No, no, we're not ready for that. So, you know, one of there's, you know, there is a reality now where you should have, well, I think there would be value in maybe look, telling teachers like, look, you don't have to be perfect. Just be human and just be conversational and don't talk down and don't try to kind of use this as a kind of a power exertion type of classroom management type of thing. Use it. And I don't blame teachers because the system forces them to manage a classroom, demand respect, if they have a gap in their knowledge, you can't be honest. You know, I can see like, oh my God, you know, like I can be, but like, if you do that in a classroom, then they're going to undermine. I mean, there's all these other dynamics that occur that why a student, why a teacher can't be human. So, but I think, you know, we're in a world where we'll probably get a subset of teachers who are scaling up. And then the rest of teachers leverage this to kind of become that human one-on-one mentor. And I think that'll be kind of the value. And then, you know, it'll just be kind of example if they say, hey, let's watch this together. And then did you get it? And if you don't, then I'll be your kind of mentor to walk you through it. I'd be happy to if anyone was interested in me doing a, I don't know, I don't know, anything like that. I'm curious about the peer-to-peer interactions in community and how far you've gotten where you could be going. You've touched on a couple of things. I think it's just world changing. Intergenerational knowledge transfer, wisdom. You talked about one room, school rooms. But what about just the usual parent-child? Exactly. Yeah. So much that could happen. So where are you? Yeah, so the peer-to-peer that's the most like, you know, on the drawing board right now. I haven't, you know, I've kind of tried it out with my cousins as a one-off basis. So I feel like it'll definitely work. And, you know, the data is being set up. But, you know, knock on whatever this is made out of. Hopefully, in the next few weeks, we'll get some resources to start doing. Because that's the most technically intensive. And, you know, we want to get to the point where not only are we doing peer-to-peer, it's seamless, and it's capturing data, but it's also recording those interactions. So, you know, you need some, once you record this, it's unlimited what you can do. And I agree with the whole teacher with the, I mean, I want a world where you can, if your kids, if your parents want to take you to Europe, it's not going to compete with your school. You go on that trip to Europe and, you know, maybe there's another one room school house, part of the same network that you can go to and meet the kids in Paris while you're there or on the plane. You can do, you know, it shouldn't, and it's all easy on your parents. You can do it too. And I agree with you completely. And the peer-to-peer, it's the hardest to do, and it's going to be kind of the one that maybe happens, but I think it'll happen in the next five years. But I think, yeah, the potential is large. So, what's the optimal length or the range of the different modules, and how many times do you have to re-tape it to satisfy yourself that it's good enough? Oh, yeah. So the question is, what's the optimal length for, I'm assuming the videos, especially, and how many times do I have to re-tape it? So when I started off, YouTube, I mean, if you go right now, YouTube limits you to 10 minutes. Now they let me do longer videos. I'm a partner in all of that. But when you start off for 10 minutes, I was like, I mean, my first video was like 11 minutes, and they didn't let me upload it. So I paid attention to the clock, and I made my videos around 9 or 10 minutes. And that's kind of the single biggest point of feedback, that that is the ideal amount of time to kind of get one concept across while being able to pay attention. I've gotten letters from people, even I talked to some people at Google who've done some user interface stuff, and how long people can pay attention. And they said, yeah, it's about 10 minutes. I think that might be even what motivated YouTube to figure out the limit. But that kind of forced me to do that. But one, that's kind of a granular type that allows people to pay attention. It kind of turns into one of these Da Vinci co-edan Brown type novels, where the East chapter is like three pages, and you're like, oh, but, okay, I'm done. You get a sense of completion as opposed to a 90 minute lecture that you can only watch 40 minutes and you feel. And then it also makes it very granular. You can really just jump in and get exactly what you need, as opposed to sitting through a 90 minute lecture and trying to find. So I found that 10 minutes is, you know, now I'm getting to a little bit. You know, I actually know I've done a few videos on pushing 20 minutes, but this is my fault. I really think everything can be done in 10 minutes. And just your other thing is how many times do I do it? Do you have to tape and retape several times to get it to where you want it? In terms of the terms of length? No, to my quality. Yeah. So how many times do I have to. So when I started, since it was for my cousins, I literally would record it and put up. I would not care. There's actually one or two videos where I'm answering telemarketer calls. I didn't care why we recorded. It's for Nadia. This is free. And that's another takeaway. People like that informality. I make mistakes. I would say like one every 12 videos I make on arithmetic, like I forget a negative number or I forget a little negative sign or I say 16 minus 8 is 5. I do something bizarre. And people really like that. Or I start a problem and I go down the wrong path first. And I say, oh wait, that's not right. I've gotten positive feedback on those things because you never see it. When you go to a class, the teacher has seen, they have the script, they've done that problem 20 times and they just do it perfect. Like you're an idiot if you didn't see that. But when you see someone who kind of knows what they're doing, they followed their intuition in one direction and it was wrong. That's okay. That's the art of mathematics of solving a problem. And then you go down a complete other path. So I tried. Now that it's getting more notoriety, I feel like, oh my God, so many people are going to watch this video. Let me like redo it. But I find it more, I think that way. It hurts the quality of the video. Does Kaplan or any of the other page for online services, Phoenix University, maybe do any of you use a competitive threat to being free? They should. No. The question, do Kaplan or Phoenix use? I've actually spoke to the research group at Apollo Group, which is the parent company for University of Phoenix. I think they're aware of it now. I've talked to Princeton Review about potentially, because I would like to use some of their materials and all of that. I think there's, in any of these groups, even textbook publishers, I've talked to a few, there's a group that's very insecure about everything. And oh, it's rad. But there's another view that's like, look, this is out there and this could even empower your instruction. If I do all the SAT problems out of your book, that hopefully you'll donate to me and I can do them, that's not going to prevent people from taking your Princeton Review course. It's going to make your time in your Princeton Review course way more productive, because the kids will have done the problems, get all their questions answered by the Sal guy, and then they can have this one-on-one interaction with the guy you're paying to teach. And there are people, I've talked to Princeton Review and the Apollo Group, who definitely believe that, but then they have to fight the inertia of, you know, we have this billion dollar franchise, we can't mess it up. But once they really view me as a competitor, then I'll start getting security. Hi. I'm wondering if you can speak a little bit more to how you devise the content for your videos. Like, are you looking at textbooks and here's the order of concepts, because you're not a kind of textbook. So I'm wondering if there's a potential to reconceptualize the way knowledge is organized to begin with. I mean, I was lucky I could follow textbooks very well, but, you know, our natural curiosities don't follow over the way we're taught, and early childhood educators have very often pointed out that you go to class 2 and you killed many children's natural curiosity. So how can you link the basics that you're teaching to the real world questions that we have, which have not been made we don't know, or have talker being made we don't know. So the question is, how do I build a curriculum, how do you decide what to cover, and give it that I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of a textbook as a primary learning source for someone who's... I do look at textbooks, you know, and that is a... but I don't go straight section 12.1, next lecture, section 12.2, next lecture. For me, and actually there's a textbook publisher who wanted me to do videos for their book. And they said, I want you to do exactly this concept on this video. And after that concept, I was like, there's no way I can get myself, it would be so boring. It would be just so mundane, it would just kill like all my credibility if I were to do a video on that. So my thing is, I try to get the big picture, like I told you with the differential evolution, spend some time all over it, and then once you have the big picture, then try to take it into the nuggets that will build you the big picture. And then maybe do the textbook or something else just to make sure you're comprehensive, that the kid's going to see everything that they might face when they take an assessment. I use a ton of Wikipedia, I use textbooks, I use other open courseware sometimes, but a lot of stuff is hard to consume. You really have to be motivated to consume, or even already have a foundation to consume a lot of these things. My value add is taking all of that and still getting down to something useful. In your model up there, you have a big arrow in it. Your data model, the mappings that you're doing are all on known right answer. How have you thought of looking at environmental terms like restoration, long-tressure? Stress can be measured in wording by somebody blinking or how long. Or EEG or something. And of course you just see. So the question is, right now I'm just tracking when they're doing the problem, how long it's taking them, what time of day they're doing it, did they get it right or wrong, did they click the hint, all that type of stuff. But there's this whole like, what was their blood pressure while they were doing the problem? Where did their eyes move? What was their cycles in their brain doing on EEG? I think that would be awesome. You could actually do some biofeedback stuff. That's a whole frontier that I think is... The only bad thing is you don't want to hook somebody up to an EEG. You could get a web camera. Oh yeah, something easy. If it can be done, try it out and see if it works. I think that would be awesome. There was research already in effective computing in Media Lab and Rosalind Picard. That's what one of her projects is. She was my first year up in the lab. She was my advisor. And then they do sweats, measurements, eye dilation and things like that. I think the fun thing about this, what I kind of view as a content cat, right now it's very content focused. Everything I talk about is the videos and these modules and all of that. Where I see it going is the content is really just seeding... In order to do all this data stuff, you need the content. Once you have a critical mass of content, then the data kind of takes over. You can start doing some really fascinating things with experiments that you couldn't have done before. Like real-time learning and getting feedback, biofeedback and all this other stuff. I think that would be awesome. In the beginning of your talk, the set used the visitors to your website surpassed MIT and Ron Forschwer. Is that true? I'll give you all my data. How do you feel about the Forschwer? How do I know that it's passing up MIT and Forschwer? How do I feel about MIT and Forschwer? Is this an improvement? There's a couple of things. It's an interesting thing about... Just on YouTube, which I think is the primary consumption area for most open-courseware, it has passed up at MIT. You can actually look at the cumulative upload views on a daily basis and just measure the delta. You can see that Khan Academy is getting about 60,000 or 70,000. MIT is getting about 30,000 to 40,000. I think next up is Berkeley. It's getting like 15,000 or something like that. That's just on that. I don't have access to MIT's web logs. You can go to indirect measures. Definitely on the internet, I'm not 100% sure. It's definitely different audience. That's the other interesting thing. There's all this open-courseware. People spend millions of dollars putting cameras in. Khan Academy is really the only game in town on K through 12, which is where all the need is. It's not like I'm like, oh yeah, MIT. They're catering to us. If we want to review, we took 18.06 already, we just want to review something. We can consume that, but that's not for a ninth grader who wants to learn how to convert a matrix. For K through 12, I think that's one reason why Khan Academy has picked up, because it is directly addressing its audience. On top of that, the open-courseware movement, which I think has been awesome, but the first time was when we put videos in classrooms. They didn't rethink the form factor. They didn't say, well, is this really the best way to learn online? We're just saying, well, we're going to show you what goes on in an MIT class, which I think is awesome. When it first came out, it was revolutionary. No, it was. That was like my promise, like days in the law. What I found was that it seemed to be dumping all this information into you. There's two things that it's going when you go there. One is, yes, it's hard to navigate. You don't know what to watch next. It's not for someone who's never seen it before. There's no direct path. The other thing is, even when I was making videos, I was doing the entropy video. I spent this whole time, I want to really understand entropy. I want to watch MIT stuff. I went through the thermodynamics lectures, and I had to sit through so much non-entropy talk to finally get to entropy. Then finally, there was exactly what I wanted. It was very hard to consume. Even when you watch the video, I think it was an awesome thing, especially because in 2000 or 2001, every other university was doing some type of for-profit, University of Phoenix-ish type of thing. I just realized it's going to be free. I think it's awesome. If you watch the videos, I probably watch, I think more than any of you all, I watch floor-open courseware videos. Every now and then, the professor puts up a slide that's like, this is a copyright issue. You cannot see with this. I'm like, oh my God, oh my God. I would say one hundred five videos. Or the camera is just not where it should be, or you can't see. I think it's awesome for other universities to see what MIT is doing. It takes a lot of security on the part of MIT to do that. It takes some confidence to just release everything that you have, basically. Because it says that there's a value of being here. This leaves us open because before this, everyone would think all these secret things are happening at MIT that are super special. But now you know exactly what's happening, and it kind of loses the mystique of the company. I agree. I've talked to open courseware, and I'm open to talking to them as much as possible. I asked them, how about it kind of becomes a K-12 offering? Because this will help recruit kids, get them interested, and I'm an alum. They're putting video cameras in classrooms right now. But hopefully that changes. I think I would love to recruit MIT other professors to do this form factor, get other students, get y'all to do whatever y'all want to do. How much of the success of the science relate to the incompetency of teachers? This is a sensitive subject. I hope you have not been a student of the best. How many teachers are in the... The reality is, look, they're incompetent anybody. They're incompetent ex. Unfortunately, some kids, that's all they get. I think there's a lot of that. The only comments I delete from the side are when this profane light. Even though some I don't get to. These are unedited comments and you'll see on pretty much every video, at least half the comments of some kid who's angry that they're paying X thousand dollars of tuition to whatever. And they spent a whole semester trying to learn it and they thought it was impossible to learn. They spent 10 minutes on some video and they're angry. They're genuinely like they want to kill somebody. So I think that's out there. There's a professor in Montreal wrote a blog post about this. Even if you say that this is above average instruction, it's better than... We could debate is it better than 90% is it better than 50%? But even if it's above average instruction, even if this instruction is better than 50% of instructors, what's the point of having those 50% of instructors? I mean, it's a thought experiment that should happen. Even if I'm not the 95% instructor, someone is. And then you get that person or someone's a 99% tile instructor. And if you have that person, then why are you having the other 99 out of 100 delivering lectures? There is... And it goes into a lot of teachers, I think, are products of the same system. They're products where they don't have the intuition and the connections. And because of that, they're kind of passing on this kind of rote, superficial understanding of things from generations. Somehow you went around the... I really think that the teachers have a value. The reason I think MIT is something that's the critical one. Because what they do is more, I think, than just kind of... You need some stuff. Is that magic? Is that a small flow in there, or something? Whatever which does the magic there, right? So I think that's a bit difficult to capture. So you're doing a really excellent job covering the 80% or 20% sources, right? And because of this teachering competency. But the question is, how do you think, for example, how do you do that, like, especially in like, whether or not you're planning to work with some kind of really tight-looked-notch teacher? So the question I think is, is it just going to be me, or are there other potential people? And even the top-notch thing, I mean, it's not clear that MIT's instruction is better than what you're going to get at the local height. I mean, those guys are going to be kick-butt, like, in terms of the research they're doing and all that. But instruction, you know, and it might be ideal for an MIT student... I mean, some of the MIT lectures, I think they're confident because they say, look how hard this class is. But the question about other instructors, you know, when I started this, I assumed that was going to be the case. I assumed that, you know, I had done like 30 videos. I was like, oh, this is fun, and people are watching it. Let me get my other buddies from MIT. They'll make some videos, and some were interested, but it was harder for me to get people to do videos than for me to just do them myself. And after some point, I had like maybe, you know, 100 or 200 videos, and I said, well, this is algebra. It's pretty much done. I said, I'm just going to keep going. But to answer your question, you know, I'm open to it. And if someone wants to, you know, a couple people have volunteered, I said, make 50 videos. If I think those 50 videos are of the same stock... Even if they don't get associated with Khan Academy, they're going to have value by themselves. They're going to be on YouTube. The world can access them. They're the same style. They're kind of coherent with the spread. I'll push traffic that way. Especially, there's a guy who just contacted me about music. He wants to do music theory. I'm like, yeah, I don't know anything about music theory, and I probably won't until you teach me about music. So I'm open to it, but it's... I don't think it's something I can put like a job posting for to make music videos. And the other thing is, a lot of very good instructors freeze up a little bit in this form factor. Because it's something... I mean, you are putting yourself out there. If you are a Nobel Prize, PhD, this... It's a lot harder when someone criticizes you than, you know... Like, yeah, I'm just a guy, like, you know... But like, when you're like the authority to kind of put yourself out there in that way, sometimes a little daunting to... I don't know if this is for you, your correct programming team, but how far away are you from having... Forget the videos, at least the drilling module for, say, high school Algebra 1 on a DS or an iPod Touch? So how far is the module from a... To having the complete drill set, all the questions, all the metrics, everything being able to load. Put Junior in the back of the minivan and do two problems every 15 minutes or every 5 minutes and teach Junior Algebra 1 in the back of the minivan all year, not having to go to class. Oh yeah, or iPad or, you know, in J... That's either iPad or iPod, not an expert. But, you know, I think it's literally... I mean, we don't have... But one developer for, you know, I don't know, 6 months devoted on that would probably be able to migrate. With the data fit, though. I mean, how much data would you need for that? I think it's just a matter of syncing it and that type of thing. It would just be implementation. But I think it could easily be consumed and done on a... Especially an iPad or something like that. There's no reason why it should be done. You're not a profit, right? Yes. And do you see yourself moving to a revenue model and have the other... Have you been approached? Yeah, I'm surprised it took this long for... Where is... Like, where is this? There's some smoke in here. Like, what is... There's no money. What's going on? No, so, yeah, it's a not-for-profit, 5.1.C. 3. And it was interesting because about a year ago, before I quit my job, I really wanted to quit my job. It was a good job, but I wanted to do this. And somebody sees it, contacts me, and you say, hey, we love what you're doing and we think you're doing an education right in all of this. How about we do a hybrid model? You can... You're gonna get a salary and you can do this, but we'll have some premium content or some... This or that or... You know, and I was very close to doing that. But then, the more and more I thought about it, especially when I spoke to them, I knew that at some point, our... Our desires are going to conflict. And my worst nightmare, my worst nightmare is that all these videos I did, all of this gets acquired by McGraw Hill. It's thrown in some library someplace and it just disappears from the land. That's my... I mean, for me, the real joy of this, even if I'm forced to drive and use Honda my entire life, is that my great-great-grandkids might be able to learn calculus from these videos. That, to me, is the most tremendously exciting, powerful thing. So it is not for profit. It was being funded by my bank account until very recently. Actually, last week, Ann and John Doar wrote a $100,000 check to give me a salary. So that's kind of... So you don't have to fill too much. I'll take some sandwiches, but I'm okay. And then I'm talking to some fairly large corporations now that they... I tell them, look, maybe show me a higher social return on an investment. A half a million dollar budget will have three, four developers. We can educate millions of kids for all time. It's not like this is a charter school and as soon as the money disappears, the school disappears. As long as someone's paying $50 a month for the web hosting, this can exist forever. It's getting replicated on all sorts of hard drives and we're going to put on Bittor and all that. So you don't even have to pay for the web hosting. So you're building a library that can continue to deliver social returns. If you do any type of back-and-down population, it's like $500,000 per year investment. The social return is going to be like... Especially if you translate it into five languages. It's like $2 billion a year. If you associate a video of you with $1. I mean, it's ridiculous. And I think people are seeing that. So hopefully we'll get some... But New York can sell out. I am not going to sell out. At least... Well, there might be a movie you want there. Hopefully I won't sell out. So to follow on that a little bit, you told us a number of ways that education is entrenched in productive ways. Is this interesting in the way Wikipedia is interesting or is this interesting in ways that can end up transforming education as it exists today? Because this could be good supplemental material that's there forever as you envision. But that doesn't... What does Wikipedia change the way... I'll repeat it. So the question is, is this going to be... Do I envision this just being like what Wikipedia is, which is a tremendous impact, but kind of a supplemental nice-to-have for the world. Or is this something that could transform education? And I think in the short term it's the former, but in the long term, and for me long term is ten years. I think it really is... So a big part of this, I view this as the operating system or the DNA for a physical school. And I am starting... I actually do a little summer camp really for me to experiment with other... What do you do with the rest of the school day? Because I view you do this for two hours and then it frees time the rest of the time into creative things. Actually write computer programs, compose music, paint instead of... To actually build things. So my goal is to kind of... That summer camp is going to get longer and longer and longer. And actually the San Jose Tech Museum is going to give us some space. We're going to start having a presence there. And so that physical experiment is going to get more and more substantial. And at some point we're going to be like, we're a real school now and this is the prototype. And I don't want to do it if it's only like a five percent better outcome than what's being... I want kids... I just painted that picture, I just built that robot and by the way I'm 12 and I'm learning calculus. I want to see that. And I think when you have one example of that, but I think in the Bay Area you can do many. But then I think as you set the example and I think the rest of the world is going to be like, wait, even our $40,000 a year fancy private school is not doing that. And they're charging $5,000 a student as opposed to... So then the next question comes, if you do that, this seems to apply to self-selecting students who seek out the materials. And even in the case of a camp, there's obviously going to be some selection there. So how applicable are the ideas then going to the school or do you have them? Right, so the idea is, this is right now applicable to a self-selecting pool of students and even the summer camp I'm doing. And that's true. And how do you apply it to a broader audience? So I think there's two. The summer camp that I showed the data with, the selection criteria was not kids with a certain IQ or kids with who've done... That was just kind of non-probable kids. So this was mainly minority kids from East Palo Alto, Redwood City, Middle of Heart, who were not... They didn't have discipline problems. But I think that actually describes 80% of students. That's not... probably 90% of students. And I'd say probably the subset that have discipline problems, a lot of it is because they're not being addressed in this way. That they have these gaps and no one can address it. And there's all sorts of social stigmas. I mean it's ridiculous that concepts and age are associated in this tightly linked way. That if you're 13 and you need help with decimals, you're stupid and I'm going to make fun of you type of... And I think that leads to a lot of social acting out and all of that. Actually, one person got... I want to get this into prisons. Because they have a lot of time. I don't know the exact answer. It's going to be some experimentation. But I suspect that this is going to appeal to a larger swath of... Because it's interactive. Everything about it, you're never having to sit passively. You're learning the way people naturally want to learn. I think a lot of these hyperactive kids or whatever, they're like natural learners. They just don't like being lectured to. They like to be interactive and talk to their peers and whatnot. So we'll see where that goes. But it's an interesting question. If there is something that can really accelerate 90% of the students but leaves behind 10%, is that a good or a bad thing? And that's a whole social debate that one could have. In case there is a movie made about you, can the other Salman Khan play this Salman Khan? So he says to the other Salman... So for those who have never done a web search for Salman Khan, I encourage you to do so when you go home. There's an Indian actor with my name. I think that's helped me beat MIT Copacours for as well. One issue you might have thought about. I've watched second grader in the neighborhood who was home school. And I'm afraid he's really missing out on the socialization factor. So if we transition more to this method of teaching, how will we not lose that? So the question is the socialization factor. And I want to be very clear. This is going to be on the internet essentially. And someone could be sitting in an isolated room and doing this and not having any socialization. But the goal when I described the one room schoolhouse is that it actually is social. For the first time you actually do get socialization in a school. Most of us, there's a thousand kids in the schoolhouse, but you don't get any interaction, especially in a needy way. Except in recess and lunch. But now this is actually encouraging socialization in the classroom where you're tutoring each other. That's actually a very good socialization. And if you think about when you want to give someone a big thumbs up. Right now the system says, oh you're a genius. You've got an 800 on your SAT. That's where you get the thumbs up. But the real thumbs up is you're a good teacher. You have empathy. You have maturity. When other kids respect you for your ability to communicate and not talk down to them. And so if you think about what people will kind of get points for, I want it to be that. That the data and the assessments show that you're a great teacher to your peers. And if you're an employer or a university, those are the kids you want to admit. Not the kid who's just racing ahead and just arrogant and all of that. I think it will actually help socialization, especially with one of them. When are you speaking at TED? Oh, so the question is, when am I speaking at TED? I don't know. Actually I just had a... I don't know. If they call me I'll go. Very good. I'll be speaking at PopTech. Have you all heard of PopTech? It's the thing in New Hampshire. It's like a V10. I'll speak at TEDx if they call me. I'll be speaking anywhere. I speak at the local high school. Excellent. Thank you.
