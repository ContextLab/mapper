We've been getting great responses from our challenge, so we thought we would issue another one. And this one will be fun, because it's something that you can make as fancy as you want, but even maybe a beginning programmer might be able to do something quite fun and interesting. And who knows, we might discover something new, a new contribution to human knowledge. The goal of this challenge, and like all other challenges, if you go to the challenge, and I'll provide the link, there's a video explaining it a little bit more detail. But it's really to visualize patterns and numbers in new and unexpected ways. Discover a new pattern, or maybe there are existing patterns that people know about, but you can visualize it in a way that we never expected. And the one that I give as an example is an Ulam spiral discovered by Ulam, where you spiral out the numbers, and there's different ways to depict it. The size of the dot is dependent on how many factors it has. Here's the inverse to the number of factors they have. We can use animation. You can use color. You can use whatever. It doesn't have to be spirals. It could be tiles. You might want to do something in three dimensions. Who knows? That's what's fun about these challenges. You will surprise everyone else. And so I encourage you to try this challenge, create new number patterns. If you want, you can build off of the code that's already there, or you could delete all of it and try to explore other number patterns. You could expose this to number patterns that we might not be aware of that might have been discovered by someone, maybe not Ulam. Whatever it is, please try. Just do something that surprises us.
