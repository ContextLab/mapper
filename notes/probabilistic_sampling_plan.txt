Probabilistic Sampling Implementation Plan
==========================================

Changes needed in index.html:

1. Global state variables (add):
   - allQuestionsPool = [] // All available questions loaded from JSON
   - askedQuestionIndices = [] // Track which questions have been asked
   - allUserResponses = [] // Full history across all rounds
   - currentRound = 0

2. loadQuestions() function:
   - Load from 'cell_questions_sample.json' (placeholder for cell_questions.json)
   - Extract all questions into allQuestionsPool
   - Add jitter to cell center coordinates: ±0.02 on x and y
   - Store as: {question, options, correct_answer, x, y, cell_center_x, cell_center_y}
   - Don't select subset yet

3. startNewQuizRound() function (new):
   - Select 10 random NEW questions (not in askedQuestionIndices)
   - If < 10 available, warn or loop back
   - Set questionsData to these 10
   - Add indices to askedQuestionIndices
   - Reset currentQuestion = 0
   - Start quiz

4. handleFinish() function (update):
   - Add current round responses to allUserResponses
   - Generate map using ALL responses from allUserResponses
   - Show "Another Round" button

5. UI Changes:
   - Map screen: Add "Another Round" button
   - Track round number display

Key data structure:
- Question format from cell_questions.json:
  {
    cells: [
      {
        cell: {center_x, center_y, ...},
        questions: [
          {question, options: {A, B, C, D}, correct_answer, ...}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
