The landscape artist who designed New York City's Central Park believed that providing scenic settings accessible to all would not only benefit the public's physical and mental health and also foster a sense of democracy. So immediately this one sounds weird and the reason why it sounds weird is that we start saying not only. And when you hear not only or when you read a not only you expect to see a but also. So you would normally expect to see someone say, hey I not only say ate a sandwich, but I also, I oriented not only did he eat a sandwich, but also he ate a or he drank a cola or he had some fries or but he also. So you would expect a but also as part of that construction and we see over here they do it and also. So I would look so I don't like it as it is. I want to rule out the first choice. That's always the one as it is. So do they have a but also here and they do but also foster a sense of democracy. So the really the right one because whenever you see a not only you also want to see a but also. So the landscape artist who designed New York City's Central Park believed that providing scenic settings accessible to all would not only benefit the public's physical and mental health but also foster a sense of democracy. Yeah, that sounds exactly right. The not only says a not only did you do this one thing, but you did other things, but you also did this other stuff. So this one is definitely the best answer.
