In drawing the slope field for the differential equation, the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to y minus two x, I would place short line segments at select points on the xy plane. Complete the sentences. At the point negative one comma one, I would draw a short segment of slope blank. And like always, pause this video and see if you can fill out these three blanks. Well, the short segments that you're trying to draw to construct this slope field, you figure out their slope based on the differential equation. So you're saying when x is equal to negative one and y is equal to one, what is the derivative of y with respect to x? And that's what this differential equation tells us. So for this first case, the derivative of y with respect to x is going to be equal to y, which is one, minus two times x, x is negative one. So this is gonna be negative two, but you're subtracting it, so it's gonna be plus two. So the derivative of y with respect to x at this point is going to be three. So I would draw a short line segment, or a short segment of slope three. And we keep going at the point zero comma two. Well, let's see, when x is zero and y is two, the derivative of y with respect to x is going to be equal to y, which is two, minus two times zero. Well, that's just going to be two. And then last but not least, for this third point, the derivative of y with respect to x is going to be equal to y, which is three, minus two times x. x here is two. Two times two, three minus four is equal to negative one. And that's all that problem asks us to do. Now, if we actually had to do it, it would look something like, I'll try to draw it real fast. So let's see, let me make sure I have, make sure I have space for all of these points here. So that's my coordinate axes. And I want to get the point zero comma two. So that's zero comma two. Actually, I want to go all the way to two comma three, so let me get some space here. So one, two, three. And then one, two, three. And then we have to go negative one, comma one, so we might go right over here. And so for this first one, and this exercise isn't asking us to do it, but I'm just making it very clear how we would construct the slope field. So the point negative one, comma one. Negative one, comma one. A sort segment of slope three. So slope three would look something like that. Then at the point zero comma two, a slope of two. Zero comma two, the slope is going to be two, which looks something like that. And then at the point two comma three, at two comma three, a sort segment of slope negative one. So two comma three, a slope, a segment of slope negative one. It would look something like that. And you would keep doing this at more and more points. If you had a computer to do it, that's what the computer would do. And you would draw these sort line segments to indicate what the derivative is at those points. And you get a sense of, I guess you could say, the solution space for that differential equation.
