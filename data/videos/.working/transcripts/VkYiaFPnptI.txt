To learn Stormers, my name is Josh Sunkquist. I am a YouTuber, best-selling author, and a Paralympic ski racer. I first started ski racing when I was a teenager. I went to my first race thinking I was like, the best skier of all time, and it was going to be amazing. I was like super excited about it. And I'm sure that's kind of how you feel when you start anything in life, right? Like maybe even when you started this class. And I went through the course, and I actually fell on like the third turn in the course. And that was really disappointing. And I was like, I expected I was going to ski really well, and I fell. And I think that is an inevitable part of anything, including this course, right? You're really excited at first, and then something happens, a problem, right? You fall, you get discouraged. And it's in that moment I think you have a choice about, do you want to quit? Do you want to just be like, that is not for me because I fell? Or do you want to say, no, falling is just part of the process. It's just something that happens along the way. And if you want to cross the finish line at the end of the race course, that is, if you want to finish the class, you have to get back up. So I got back up, and I fell down again. I got back up and fell down. I actually fell down five times in this race course. It was not very good, as it turns out. But I kept getting back up, and for that reason, I eventually crossed the finish line. And so what I want to say to you is that when you fall, when something doesn't work out quite the way that you wanted, when you get discouraged, that's not a reason to quit. That's just part of the process. And it's in those moments that you have to look at the finish line that you're trying to reach and say, all right, I'm going to get back up. And I'm going to keep getting back up as many times as it takes until I cross that finish line. So keep up the good work. Keep getting back up, and good luck in the rest of your class.
