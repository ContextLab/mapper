Welcome back! I'm Rachel, a professional learning specialist at Khan Academy and a former classroom teacher. In this video, I'm thrilled to tell you more about Khanmigo, our cutting-edge AI teaching assistant, designed to enrich the learning journey while prioritizing the utmost safety and privacy for both students and staff. At Khan Academy, the security of our community is paramount. Rest assured, your school data and details are treated with the highest confidentiality and protected with advanced encryption technologies to prevent unauthorized access. As a nonprofit educational organization, Khan Academy is committed to exploring the positive potential of AI in education while ensuring responsible and ethical development. Here are some key safety features incorporated into Khanmigo. We prioritize ethical AI development, putting the needs of students and teachers first. Khanmigo uses moderation technology to detect and prevent inappropriate or harmful interactions. Our moderation system automatically notifies adults connected to the child's account when inappropriate interactions are detected. In-product messaging transparently outlines the capabilities and limitations of Khanmigo's AI technology. Built-in feedback features allow users to easily report any questions or concerns directly to the Khan Academy team. AI is not always accurate and is not completely safe. We acknowledge that it is not possible to eliminate all risks. Therefore, we work diligently to identify risks and put mitigation measures in place. We mitigate risk by using technical approaches such as fine-tuning the AI to help increase accuracy, prompt engineering to guide and narrow the focus of the AI allowing us to tailor the AI for an educational setting, monitoring and moderating participant interactions so that we can flag potentially inappropriate content, and red-teaming to deliberately try to break or find flaws in the AI in order to uncover potential vulnerabilities. Let's talk about how Khanmigo is built to protect students even when things don't go as planned. Our moderation system is designed to keep conversations safe and supportive. When a student shares or says something to Khanmigo that might be unsafe or concerning, our system alerts teachers immediately. This way, teachers can quickly address the situation in a way that supports the student's needs. For more severe safety concerns, our system takes an extra step by notifying school administrators directly. This ensures that the most serious issues are handled with the utmost care and urgency, involving professionals who are equipped to manage such situations. Our goal is to create a safe and positive learning environment for all students, making sure that help is available whenever it is needed. Administrators can trust Khanmigo as a secure platform for educational excellence backed by rigorous safety protocols and a commitment to user privacy. By implementing Khanmigo in your school, you're embracing innovative teaching practices while ensuring a secure learning environment for every student. Remember, protecting your privacy is a collaborative effort. Let's continue to learn safely and effectively with Khanmigo. Thanks for watching!
