The single biggest expense for most people is paying for some type of housing. And so that's why this is a really important unit in this financial literacy journey. Because if you make some bad decisions on housing, you overspend, you might end up in a pretty bad situation. So this first lesson talks about the classic renting versus buying. One isn't always the right answer. It depends on what the circumstances are. And hopefully the videos and articles in this lesson help students understand some of those trade-offs, be able to ask and get educated questions and get the right information they need. And of course we have practice on it as well. And then how do you find the home that you might want to live in? What type of terms you need to understand in your lease agreements, making sure you're understanding the fine print. If you are taking a loan to buy a house, making sure you're understanding mortgages. I myself am guilty the first time I bought a house. I just kind of signed the paperwork. It worked out okay, but I had this nagging feeling that I should know more of what I was actually signing. Hopefully this at least gives students a primer, helps them understand. And as I always say, it's not just about them, it's them, it's their ability also to hopefully help other family members, maybe even their parents. So the more that you can engage on this unit, do the exercises, read the articles, watch the videos, and even bring a little bit of your own story, of your own life decisions, mistakes, things that went well to your students' lives. I think it's just going to, those stories are gonna really make it stick with them and really make them pay attention to this very important unit.
