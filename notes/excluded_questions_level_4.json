        "A": "It assigns positions randomly, which eliminates privilege.",
        "B": "It bases advancement on demonstrated ability and performance, but unequal access to resources (education, preparation, mentorship) means not everyone can demonstrate ability equally, undermining equality of opportunity.",
        "C": "It guarantees equal funding to education for all, ensuring everyone can demonstrate ability equally.",

        "A": "They chose by tested ability and performance, not family ties. That matches meritocracy and opposes nepotism. Critics say tests and unequal education make it unfair. Michael Young popularized the term as a satire.",
        "B": "They chose by exam, so meritocracy always gives equal results. Michael Young invented the exams.",
        "C": "They chose by exam, but meritocracy means the richest always rule. Critics praise this. Confucius coined the word.",
        "D": "They chose by exam, so it is an aristocracy where birth decides power. Meritocracy favours families. Michael Young supported this."
