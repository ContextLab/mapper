        "A": "It depends on the rank of the coefficient matrix relative to the augmented matrix: if rank(A) = rank([A|b]) = n (number of unknowns), there is a unique solution; if rank(A) = rank([A|b]) < n, infinitely many solutions exist (parameterized by n - rank free variables); if rank(A) < rank([A|b]), the system is inconsistent (no solution)",
        "B": "A system always has exactly one solution whenever it has the same number of equations as unknowns, because a square coefficient matrix is always invertible and Cramer's rule always applies",

        "D": "Systems with more unknowns than equations always have no solution because the system is underdetermined and there are not enough constraints to pin down any variable. The extra unknowns create contradictory requirements that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, which is why wide rectangular systems are always inconsistent. This is a direct consequence of the pigeonhole principle applied to linear constraints: if there are more unknowns than equations, some unknowns receive no constraint and the system becomes contradictory"

        "A": "The determinant of a matrix is identical to its trace (the sum of diagonal elements), because both quantities measure the overall magnitude of the linear transformation. The trace captures how much each coordinate axis is individually scaled, and the determinant is just the product of these individual scalings, making the two quantities interchangeable for any practical purpose in geometric interpretation. This equivalence holds for matrices of any size and over any field",
        "B": "The determinant of a matrix gives the signed volume scaling factor of the linear transformation: |det(A)| measures how the transformation scales volumes (areas in 2D), and the sign indicates whether orientation is preserved (positive) or reversed (negative). det(A) = 0 means the transformation collapses space to a lower dimension",
        "C": "The determinant counts the total number of nonzero entries in the matrix, providing a measure of the matrix's sparsity. Dense matrices with many nonzero entries have large determinants, while sparse matrices with few nonzero entries have small determinants",
        "D": "The determinant is always a positive real number for any square matrix regardless of its entries, because the Leibniz expansion formula involves alternating signs that always cancel to produce a nonnegative result. This positivity is why the determinant can serve as a volume measure — volumes are inherently nonneg, so a quantity representing volume must be nonneg as well. Matrices with negative entries may appear to produce negative determinants, but this is always a computational error"

        "A": "Matrix multiplication is actually commutative for all matrices, just like ordinary number multiplication. The order AB versus BA makes no difference to the result because the entry-by-entry computation of the product matrix depends only on dot products of rows and columns, which are symmetric operations. The common claim that matrix multiplication is non-commutative is a widespread misconception that arises from computational errors when students multiply matrices by hand and get different results due to arithmetic mistakes rather than genuine non-commutativity",
        "B": "Non-commutativity of matrix multiplication is purely a computational artifact of the row-by-column multiplication algorithm and has no geometric or physical meaning whatsoever. If matrices were multiplied using a different algorithm — for example element-wise (Hadamard) multiplication — the operation would be commutative, showing that non-commutativity is a property of our chosen algorithm rather than an intrinsic property of linear transformations. The geometric interpretation of matrices as transformations is unrelated to how we choose to multiply them",
        "C": "Matrix multiplication is non-commutative only for non-square rectangular matrices where the dimension mismatch prevents reversing the multiplication order, but for square matrices of any size the multiplication is always commutative. This is because square matrices form a ring under addition and multiplication, and all matrix rings over commutative base fields inherit commutativity from the scalar field. The common textbook examples showing AB ≠ BA for square matrices are always constructed using matrices over non-commutative coefficient rings like the quaternions, not over the real or complex numbers",
        "D": "Matrices represent linear transformations, and AB means 'first apply B, then apply A.' Since composing transformations in different orders generally gives different results (rotating then reflecting differs from reflecting then rotating), matrix multiplication is non-commutative.

        "A": "It tells us that every linear map trades dimension: what is 'used up' mapping to the range is exactly what is 'lost' in the kernel. For an m×n matrix A with rank r, the solution set of Ax = 0 has dimension n - r (nullity), so the total 'budget' of input dimensions is split between output dimensions (range) and collapsed dimensions (null space). This constrains everything: underdetermined systems (n > m) must have nontrivial null spaces, and full-rank square matrices must be invertible",
        "B": "The rank-nullity theorem applies only to square matrices and has no generalization to rectangular matrices or abstract linear transformations between spaces of different dimensions",
        "C": "The theorem simply states that all linear maps are invertible, which is a trivial consequence of the definition of linearity and requires no deep mathematical content",
        "D": "The rank-nullity theorem is fundamentally about eigenvalues rather than dimensions of subspaces: it states that the sum of all eigenvalues of a linear map equals the dimension of the domain, which provides a constraint on the spectral decomposition rather than on the geometric structure of the range and kernel. This eigenvalue interpretation is why the theorem appears in spectral theory textbooks rather than in introductory treatments of linear maps, and it explains why the result requires the base field to be algebraically closed — eigenvalues may fail to exist over non-closed fields, invalidating the dimension count"

        "A": "Orthogonal matrices represent arbitrary scalings and shear transformations, including non-uniform stretching along coordinate axes and volume-changing deformations. The constraint QᵀQ = I merely ensures that the transformation is invertible by requiring the inverse to equal the transpose, but it places no restriction on how distances, angles, or volumes are affected by the transformation. Any invertible matrix whose transpose happens to serve as its inverse qualifies as orthogonal regardless of its geometric properties",
        "B": "Orthogonal matrices represent rigid transformations that preserve distances and angles — rotations (when det(Q) = +1) and reflections composed with rotations (when det(Q) = -1). Their columns form an orthonormal basis. In ℝ³, det = +1 gives proper rotations (SO(3)), and det = -1 includes improper rotations (reflections). The eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices have absolute value 1, lying on the unit circle in ℂ",
        "C": "Orthogonal matrices always have determinant equal to zero, making them singular and non-invertible despite the superficial appearance that QᵀQ = I implies invertibility. The apparent contradiction is resolved by recognizing that QᵀQ = I holds only as an approximate numerical identity rather than an exact algebraic one, because floating-point rounding errors in the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process prevent exact satisfaction of the orthogonality constraint in any finite-precision computation",

      "options": {
        "A": "RIP requires that every sufficiently sparse vector's norm is approximately preserved under the measurement matrix: (1-δ)‖x‖² ≤ ‖Ax‖² ≤ (1+δ)‖x‖² for all s-sparse x — random matrices (Gaussian, Bernoulli) satisfy this because random projections approximately preserve distances with high probability via concentration inequalities, and recovery algorithms exploit the resulting injectivity on sparse vectors to solve an underdetermined system with L1 minimization",
        "B": "Compressed sensing works by simply taking the pseudoinverse of the measurement matrix, which always recovers any signal regardless of sparsity, and RIP is an unnecessary theoretical condition with no practical relevance",
        "C": "The restricted isometry property requires deterministic construction of the measurement matrix using specific algebraic codes, and random matrices never satisfy RIP because their behavior is too unpredictable",
        "D": "RIP is a property of the signal being measured rather than the measurement matrix, and it states that the signal must be exactly sparse (not approximately sparse) for any recovery to succeed"

        "B": "The nuclear norm ‖A‖* = Σσᵢ is the convex envelope of the rank function on the unit spectral-norm ball — just as L1 norm is the convex relaxation of L0 (sparsity) for vectors, the nuclear norm is the tightest convex surrogate for rank, enabling convex optimization (semidefinite programming) to find low-rank solutions in problems like matrix completion, where minimizing rank directly is NP-hard",
        "C": "The trace norm penalizes all singular values equally and provides no preference for low-rank solutions over full-rank solutions, making it unsuitable as a rank surrogate",
