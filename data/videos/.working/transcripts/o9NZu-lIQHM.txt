So this is Sal Khan here with Emily Abrash, our Biology Content Fellow. And you have a PhD in Biology, so you know what you're talking about. You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? And so what are our, you know, Khan Academy has had biology content for a long time now. You know, back in the day, I think in 2007, 2008, I had made a handful of biology videos. But what are we hoping to do now? I mean, I think here what we're really going for is having really comprehensive coverage. Really making sure that we look at all of the different branches of biology and have great material that's gonna be a resource for someone who's looking at any one of those. Not just certain things that happen to be cool, but really digging into a lot of different branches of the subject. And so how are you thinking about it? I mean, you're out there trying to figure out what we should cover and what we shouldn't cover. What is your hope for the next year? I mean, my hope is really that we're gonna have material that will serve pretty much anybody who's in like an advanced high school level or an intro college level class. And I mean, there's a lot of diversity in those classes, so it's not going to match every class. But the hope would be that if you encounter a topic that you're confused about or interested in in one of those classes, that you would be able to come to us and really learn more about that. And the way we've been working together is fun. It's fun to actually have people to work with now. They never fit into the walk-in closet, but now we have. And you've been doing a pretty incredible job. You've been obviously taking a high level view, thinking about the different gaps, what we need to fill in to really have exhaustive coverage for intro college biology class or an AP biology class. You've been writing articles like this one right over here where it's to really give a hopefully intuitive but thoughtful explanation and kind of deep explanation of what's going on. You're also, we're working together to produce more videos so that once again, we don't just cover a lot of the main ideas in biology, we're covering all of the things that you would see in an AP biology class or a college class. So what's next? What are you working on right now? Right now, I am just sort of in the middle of genetics. You've already got a lot of great videos on genetics, so I'm kind of looking at what we already have as well as sort of some extensions of that, like the sort of the chromosomal basis of genetics and how that was discovered. So that's kind of what's on my plate right now, but after that, it'll kind of be a full steam ahead into molecular biology, DNA replication, transcription and translation, which again, we've already got some great content on, but there are places where I think we can even build it out some more. I'm excited, I know I have a backlog of four or five videos that you've been asking for for a few days, so they'll be coming soon. I'm excited for them. All right, thank you.
