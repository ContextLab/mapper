Hi teachers, Sal Khan here from Khan Academy. And I just wanted to remind you that LearnStorm is back and better than ever. And in case you're wondering, why should I use LearnStorm or the LearnStorm tracker? We just have to remember what it's like to be a learner. A lot of times as a learner, you're trying to get through the material, it's just you and the material, it can feel a little bit lonely. But we know it's very motivating to be part of something bigger than yourself. And so what LearnStorm does is it takes those individual learning journeys of all your students as they're trying to do their assignments on Khan Academy, as they're trying to get mastery on Khan Academy and turns it into a quest and adventure for the entire classroom where you're all one team and you as a teacher are their leader to see if on a regular basis, on a weekly basis, they can reach their goals. So use that LearnStorm tracker to create a sense of excitement, a sense of adventure, a sense of camaraderie and shared journey. The second reason, and there are many others to get very excited, is that this year, finally, LearnStorm is not just measuring whether students are doing assignments, but whether they're actually mastering the content. So this reinforces a growth mindset. If you haven't mastered it, that's okay. You can have another shot, you just haven't mastered it yet. So we're so excited to be partnering with all of you and all of your students on this year's LearnStorm adventure.
