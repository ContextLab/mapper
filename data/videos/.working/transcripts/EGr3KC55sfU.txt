Let's see if we can write 0.0727 as a fraction. Now let's just think about what places these are in. This is in the tenths place. Tenths, this is in the hundredths place. Hundreds, hundredths place. This two is in the thousandths place. Thousands, and this seven right here, this last seven, is in the ten thousandths place. Ten thousandths. So there's a couple of ways we can do this. The way I like to think of this, this term right over here is in the ten thousandths place. We can view this whole thing right over here as 727 ten thousandths. Because this is the smallest term, the smallest place right over here. So let's just rewrite it. This is equal to 727 over ten thousand. And we've already written it as a fraction. And I think that's about as simplified as we can get. This number up here is not divisible by two. It's not divisible by five. In fact, it's not divisible by three, which means it wouldn't be divisible by six or nine. It doesn't even seem to be divisible by seven. It might be a prime number. But I think we are done.
