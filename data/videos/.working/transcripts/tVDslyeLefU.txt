So I have this rectangular prism here. It's kind of the shape of a brick or a fish tank. And it's made up of these unit cubes. And each of these unit cubes, we're saying, is 1 fourth of a foot by 1 fourth of a foot by 1 fourth of a foot. So you could almost imagine that this is, so let me write it this way. This is 1 fourth of a foot by 1 fourth of a foot by 1 fourth of a foot. Those are its length, height, and width, or depth, whatever you want to call it. So given that, what is the volume of this entire rectangular prism going to be? So I'm assuming you've given a go at it. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. You could first think about the volume of each unit cube, and then think about how many unit cubes there are. So let's do that. The unit cube, its volume is going to be 1 fourth of a foot times 1 fourth of a foot times 1 fourth of a foot. Or another way to think about it is, it's going to be 1 fourth times 1 fourth cubic feet, which is often written as feet to the third power, cubic feet. So 1 fourth times 1 fourth is 1 16th times 1 fourth is 1 64th. So this is going to be 1 over 64 cubic feet, or 1 64th of a cubic foot. That's the volume of each of these unit cubes. Now how many of them are there? Well, you could view them as kind of these two layers. The first layer has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. That's this first layer right over here. And then we have the second layer down here, which would be another 8. So it's going to be 8 plus 8, or 16. So the total volume here is going to be 16 times 1 64th of a cubic foot, which is going to be equal to 16 over 64 cubic feet, which is a 16 cubic feet, which is the same thing. 16 64ths is the same thing as 1 fourth. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 16. This is the same thing as 1 fourth of a cubic foot. And that's our volume. Now there's other ways that you could have done this. You could have just thought about the dimensions of the length, the width, and the height. The width right over here is going to be 2 times 1 fourth feet, which is equal to 1 half of a foot. The height here is the same thing. It's 2 times 1 fourth of a foot, which is equal to 2 fourths, or 1 half of a foot. And then the length here is 4 times 1 fourth of a foot. Well, that's equal to 4 fourths of a foot, which is equal to 1 foot. So to figure out the volume, we could multiply the length times the width times the height. And these little dots here, these aren't decimals. I've written them a little higher. These are another way. It's a shorthand for multiplication instead of writing this kind of x-looking thing, this cross-looking thing. So the length is 1. The width is half of a foot, so times 1 half. And then the height is another half. Let me do it this way. The height is another half. So it's 1 times 1 half times 1 half. Well, that's going to be equal to 1 fourth. And this is a foot. This is a foot. This is a foot. So foot times foot times foot. That's going to be feet to the third power, or cubic feet. 1 fourth of a cubic foot. Either way, we got the same result, which is good.
