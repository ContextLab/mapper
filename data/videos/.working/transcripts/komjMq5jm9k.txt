So we have a question here from the 2015 AP calculus AB test and it says, consider the curve given by the equation y to the third minus xy is equal to two. It can be shown that the first derivative of y with respect to x is equal to that, so they solved that for us. And then part c of it, I skipped parts a and b for the sake of this video, evaluate the second derivative of y with respect to x at the point on the curve where x equals negative one and y is equal to one. So pause this video and see if you can do that. All right, now let's do it together. And so let me just first write down the first derivative. So dy, derivative of y with respect to x, is equal to y over three y squared minus x. Well, if we're concerning ourselves with the second derivative, well then we wanna take the derivative with respect to x of both sides of this. So let's just do that, do the derivative operator on both sides right over here. Now on the left-hand side, we of course are going to get the second derivative of y with respect to x. But what do we get on the right-hand side? And there's multiple ways to approach this, but for something like this, the quotient rule probably is the best way to tackle it. I sometimes complain about the quotient rule saying, hey, it's just a variation of the product rule, but it's actually quite useful in something like this. We just have to remind ourselves that this is going to be equal to the derivative of the numerator with respect to x. And so that's just going to be derivative of y with respect to x times the denominator, three y squared minus x, minus the numerator, y, times the derivative of the denominator with respect to x. Well, what's the derivative of this denominator with respect to x? Well, the derivative of three y squared with respect to x, that's going to be the derivative of three y squared with respect to y, which is just going to be six y, I'm just using the power rule there, times the derivative of y with respect to x. All I did just now is I took the derivative of that with respect to x, which is the derivative of that with respect to y, times the derivative of y with respect to x, comes straight out of the chain rule minus the derivative of this with respect to x, which is just going to be equal to one. All of that over, remember we're in the middle of the quotient rule right over here, all of that over the denominator squared. All of that over three y squared minus x squared. Now lucky for us, they want us to evaluate this at a point as opposed to have to do a bunch of algebraic simplification here. So we can say when, well let me do it over here. So when, I'll do it right here. When x is equal to negative one and y is equal to one, well first of all, what's dy dx going to be? The derivative of y with respect to x, let me scroll down a little bit so we have a little bit more space. The derivative of y with respect to x is going to be equal to one over three times one squared, which is just three, minus negative one. So this is going to be plus one. It's going to be equal to one fourth. And so this whole expression over here, so I can write the second derivative of y with respect to x is going to be equal to, well we know that that's going to be equal to one fourth. One fourth times three times one squared, which is just three, minus negative one, so plus one, minus one, so I'll just leave that minus out there, times six times one, times one fourth. Let me just write it out. Six, six times one, times one fourth, minus one, all of that over, let's see, this is going to be three times y squared, y is one, so this is going to be three, three, minus negative one, so plus one, squared. Now what is this going to be? And this is just simplifying something here. One fourth times four, that's going to simplify to one. And let's see, this is going to be one and a half, minus one, so that's going to be one half. And then we're going to have all of that over 16. And so this is going to be equal to, we get a mini drum roll here, this is going to be equal to one minus one half, which is equal to one half, over 16, which is the same thing as one, over 32. And we are done.
