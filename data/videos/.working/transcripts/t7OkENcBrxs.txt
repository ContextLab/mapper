We're asked to apply the distributive property to factor out the greatest common factor. We have 35 plus 50 is equal to, so let me get my scratch pad out. So we have 35 plus 50 is equal to, now what's the greatest common factor of 35 and 50? So what's the largest whole number that's divisible into both of these? Well I could write 35 as, let's see, I could write that as five times seven, and I could write 50 as five times 10, and so we see five is the greatest common factor. Seven and 10 don't have any factors in common. So I could rewrite this, I could write 35 as equal to five, five times seven, and I could rewrite 50 as equal to, get another color here, I could rewrite 50 as five times 10, five times 10, and of course I'm adding them. So I have plus right over here. If I want I could put parentheses, but order of operations would make me do the multiplication first anyway. But now I want to factor out that greatest common factor. I want to factor out, I want to factor out the five. So what we're really doing right over here is I am unwinding the distributive property. So if I factor out a five, this is going to be equal to, let's factor out the five, five times, so you do 35 divided by five, or you're just left with the seven. You're just left with the seven over here. So you're just left with the seven after you've factored out the five, and over here you're just left with the 10. So five, or seven, plus seven plus 10, and we're done. 35 plus 50 is equal to five times seven plus 10. So let me now go and type that in. So this is the same thing as five, five times seven plus 10. And you know you've factored out the greatest common factor because seven and 10 don't have any factors in common anymore. That's the greatest common factor. They don't have any factors in common anymore. They're called relatively prime. They have no factors in common other than one. So we could now check that. Let's do a couple more of these. Apply the distributive property to factor out the greatest common factor. So let's see if we can just do this one a little bit faster. So let's see, the largest number is divisible in 75 and 20. I don't know, let me try five. If I say five times, so 75 divided by five, let's see, is going to be, it's going to be 15, is that right? Yeah, because five times 10 is 50. Five times five is 25, yeah, so it's 15. And I got that 15 by dividing 75 by five. So 15 plus, and then 20 divided by five would be, 20 divided by five would be four. 15 plus four, and let's see, did I do this right? 15 and four don't have any factors in common. And if I were to apply the distributive property here, I'd have five times 15 is 75. Five times four is 20. Yeah, I'm feeling good about that. Got it right.
