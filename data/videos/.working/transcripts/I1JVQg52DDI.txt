Hello families, I'm Rachel with Khan Academy. Today I'm excited to introduce you to Khanmigo, an innovative tool designed to enhance teaching and learning. Khanmigo is an AI-powered teaching assistant and personal tutor that provides a helping hand for teachers and individualized support for students as they navigate their educational journey. It's like having a tutor available 24-7, ready to assist with questions, provide explanations, and offer guidance on a wide range of subjects, all from the comfort of your home or wherever your student is learning. Students may receive Khanmigo access if their school has it included in a district partnership with Khan Academy. As a parent, you may purchase the Khanmigo subscription of your own to use with your children or in a homeschool setting. One of the key features of Khanmigo is its ability to foster engagement. With its AI-powered learner activities, your child can ask questions and get instant feedback, whether they're reviewing schoolwork, preparing for a test, or discovering a new topic together with you. This interactive approach encourages them to explore topics more deeply and develop a love for learning. Khanmigo also supports critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By providing hints and guiding questions, it encourages students to think through challenges rather than simply giving them the answers. As parents, you can sit with your child, ask questions together, and watch as they work through challenges. This helps them become independent learners while giving you insight into their progress, which helps build their confidence and independence as learners. Khanmigo also offers tools designed for parents to stay involved in their child's learning. These features allow you to monitor progress, explore subjects alongside your child, and create learning experiences tailored to their needs. Whether you're homeschooling, helping with homework, or just supporting their education, Khanmigo is a resource built to empower you as a learning partner. We encourage you to engage with your child about their experiences with Khanmigo. Ask them what they've learned, what challenges they've faced, and how they feel about using this tool. Your involvement can make a significant difference in their motivation and success. Thank you for taking the time to learn about Khanmigo. Together, we can empower our students to thrive in their educational journeys and make the most of the resources available to them. Let's support our children in becoming confident, curious, and capable learners.
