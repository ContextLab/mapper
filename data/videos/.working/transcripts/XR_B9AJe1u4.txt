We are told that Tony has 2 thirds of a bag of dark chocolate chips and 4 fifths of a bag of white chocolate chips. Determine a reasonable estimate of the total amount of chocolate chips Tony has. So pause this video and see if you can figure out which of these choices is the best reasonable estimate of the total amount of chocolate chips. All right, now let's work on this together. Now in the future, we will learn how to actually add something like 2 thirds to 4 fifths, but for the sake of this exercise, we just wanna get good at estimating it. And one way to estimate is to try to visualize. So let's make, so this is a hole right over here, and then this is another hole right over there, trying to make them the same size. Now what does 2 thirds look like? Well, let me divide this into three equal sections. So that is pretty close. It's hand drawn, so it's not perfect, but I think it gets the job done. And 2 thirds would be, that's 1 third right over there, and then that is 2 thirds right there. And what does 4 fifths look like? Well, let's see, I can divide this into fifths. So 1 fifth, 2 fifths, 3 fifths, and then 4 fifths and 5 fifths. That is pretty good. And now what does 4 fifths look like? Well, it would be 1 fifth, 2 fifths, 3 fifths, and then 4 fifths. So if we were to add these two together, do we have less than 1 half of a bag, more than 1 half of a bag, but less than 1 bag, or more than 1 bag? Well, when you see even the first 2 thirds, where is a half? A half would have been right around there, if we're talking about half of it. So 2 thirds is more than a half. And then we also see that 4 fifths is more than a half. If you had a half, it would have been like this far. So you can see that you're adding two things together that are both more than a half. And if you have 2 halves of something, that would be a whole. So if you have 2 things that are more than a half, if you add them together, you're gonna have more than a bag of chocolate chips. So I like this choice right over here. Let's do another example. So here we are told that a banana weighs 3 eighths of a kilogram, an apple weighs 2 thirds of a kilogram. Determine a reasonable estimate for the weight of both fruits. So pause this video again and see if you can have a go at that. All right, so the key is that we need to determine a reasonable estimate. So let's actually just try to represent these again. So how could I represent 3 eighths of something, of a kilogram in this case? Well, let me draw a rectangle here, and I'm gonna try to divide it into eighths, eight equal sections. So that looks about a half. Let me do it right over there. That looks like about a half. And then if I were to divide those, these would be fourths. And this is hand-drawn, so it's not perfect, but it will help us understand things a bit. So then let me divide these. And so this would get me to eighths. So I have eight sections here, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. If I'm talking about three of those eight equal sections, I'd have 1 eighth, 2 eighths, and 3 eighths. So that is 3 eighths right over there. And what does 2 thirds look like? So I'll do that in purple. So if this is a whole, this is a whole like that. If I divide it into three equal sections, it's gonna be something like that. I could draw it a little bit better. So something like that. And so two of those three equal sections, that's 1 third, and so that is 2 thirds. Now what happens if I try to add these things together? Well, one thing I could try to do to help visualize is I could take that piece there. The holes are roughly the same length, or I tried to draw them so that they are roughly the same length. And if I were to copy and paste that and then move that over here, it looks like if I were to estimate it, I'm getting pretty close to a whole kilogram here. So it's definitely not just about 1 third of a kilogram. 1 third of a kilogram would be just one of these three equal sections. We're way more than that, so we rule that out. About 1 kilogram, that's what we saw. When we take the 2 thirds and add to that 3 eighths, where it looks like, and once again, we were estimating, we don't know exactly, looks like we're a little bit over a kilogram. So I like this choice. And we're nowhere close to 2 kilograms. 2 kilograms would be filling in another hole on top of this one right over here. So it's not that choice either.
