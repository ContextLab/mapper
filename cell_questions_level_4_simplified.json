      "question": "Mia goes to a public school where teachers invite questions. She joins a coding club after school. Her grandmother teaches her cooking at home. Her friend Luis goes to a school where teachers only give facts and discourage questions. Luis has no home computer and his parents work long hours. Which option best explains why Mia will likely learn more skills and think more critically later?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mia learns in formal, non-formal, and informal settings; teachers encourage questions; she has tech access and family support.",
        "B": "Only formal school matters, so after-school clubs and home learning do not affect Mia's future skills or thinking.",
        "C": "Being taught facts without questions prepares students for tests, so Luis will likely think more critically and get better jobs.",
        "D": "Success comes only from native intelligence, so teaching style, technology, and parent help do not change outcomes."

      "question": "Two communities: A is a small hunting band where people share food and tease big hunters. B is a large industrial city with factories, rich owners, and elite schools that pass advantages to children. B shows larger gaps in income, power, and privilege. Which choice best explains why B is more stratified and what shapes people's rank? Which choice also sums up how action and conflict theories explain stratification?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Because B is more complex, people have unequal access to wealth, jobs, education, and power. Action theory says hierarchy helps keep order. Conflict theory (Marx) says owners hoard resources and limit mobility.",
        "B": "B is more stratified only because people in B want more wealth. So social class is a personal choice.",
        "C": "Stratification comes only from birth and kinship. Education, jobs, race, or gender do not affect rank.",

Let $x$ be servers and $w$ be average wait in minutes. The principal wants to minimize cost plus wait, written as minimize $5x + 2w$. Because arrivals are random, $w$ is hard to find exactly.
