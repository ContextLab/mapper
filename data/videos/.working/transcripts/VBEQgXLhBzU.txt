Let's give ourselves some intuition and then some practice adding negative numbers. So let's start with negative 11 plus negative three. So first we can visualize what negative 11 looks like on a number line like this. I intentionally have not marked off any of the numbers. We can just build an intuition for what's going to happen here. So if we're talking about negative 11, you could think about that as 11 to the left of zero. Or if you start at zero right over here, we are going to go 11 to the left, which I'm just estimating, I have nothing marked here, but let's just say that gets us right about there. Now to that, I am going to add negative three. So if I start at negative 11 and I add negative three, I'm gonna go three more to the left. I'm gonna go three more even more in the negative direction. So it's going to go something like that. And I'm gonna end up even more negative, even further from zero, further to the left from zero than I was at negative 11. You might already be guessing what that is, but we'll think about that more in a little bit. Let's do another example. Let's say negative 11 plus three. What would that look like? Well, we have the same negative 11 going on right over here, which we already drew, but now let me do plus three in a different color. Let me do it in green so we don't get confused. So negative 11 plus three. So if we start at negative 11 right over here, but now we're adding three. So now I'm gonna go to the right. So notice here, I'm still ending up left of zero on the number line. So I'm still going to end up in a negative place, but it is less negative. It's left, it's less to the left than that negative 11 was, but that's interesting. I'm still gonna get a negative value. Now let's imagine if I were to have positive 11 plus negative three. Think about what would happen there. So positive 11, let me do this in this red color. It might look something like this. Positive 11 would look something like that. I'm starting at zero and I go 11 to the right. And now I'm going to add negative three to that. I'm gonna add negative three. So where I left off here, I'm now going to go three. Am I going to the right or to the left? What's a negative three? I'm going to go to the left over here. So it might get us someplace right around there. So I went 11 to the right and then I go three to the left. So I'm still going to end up to the right. I'm still going to have a positive value, but it's going to be less positive than that 11 over there. Now let's give one more scenario. And this is one that you're probably familiar with for many years. If I had positive 11 plus three, well, I have that positive 11 in red already over there. And then if I were to add three, it would get me even more positive. And I think you know what that probably is if you go even more positive. So there's a couple of interesting patterns. If we are adding numbers of the same signs, so if we're adding two negatives, we still end up with a negative. If we add two positives, we still end up with a positive. But when we're adding numbers of different signs, you actually end up taking on the sign of whichever one is further from zero. So for example, when I took negative 11 plus three, negative 11 plus three, I still end up in, I still end up with an answer that is to the left of zero, something that is negative because 11 is further to the left of zero than three is moving in the right direction. And then when we did 11 plus negative three, it was the other way around. Hopefully we've built up some intuition. And now all I'm going to do is tackle these exact same problems, but we're going to do it with a number line that actually has the numbers marked off and we can actually compute what these are going to be. So let me delete all of this and then let me give ourselves, let's mark these things off and then let's do the same ones over again. So if I were to say negative 11 plus negative three, what would that get us? I don't try to remember the colors I just used. Negative 11, I can start at zero here and I'm going to go to the left 11 and I get to, whoops, I went a little bit too far. I'm going to go all the way, negative five, negative 10, right over here, negative 11, gets me right over there. And then to that, I am going to add negative three. So to that, I'm going to, different color, let me do this carefully. To that, I am going to add negative three. So I start there and I'm going to go three more to the left. So one, two, three. So I am going to end up right over there. And where do I end up? That is at negative 14. So this is equal to negative, I'm going to do this in a neutral color, is equal to negative 14. Now let's actually let's do this in different orders just to see what's going on here. Let's do the, essentially something very similar, but let's go to the right of the number line. Let's do 11 plus three. So 11 plus three, we could start with positive 11. So let me do that in red. So positive 11 would look like that. That's that right over there. And then I am going to add three. So I'm going to add one, two, three, and I get to positive 14. So notice, here I ended up 14 to the right of zero, here I ended up 14 to the left of zero. But now let's look at the scenarios where we had mixed signs. So let's say we have negative 11 plus three. What do we think that is going to be equal to? So we already have drawn negative 11. That is negative 11 right over there. And now we want to think about plus three. So we're going to start right over here, and I'll do it a little bit higher so we can see ourselves. And then plus three, we're going to go three to the right from that point. So one, two, three, where do we end up? Well, this right over here is negative eight. So we are now at negative eight. Now let's do it, let's do the other way around. If we had positive 11 plus negative three, what is that going to be equal to? Well, we've already drawn positive 11 here, but now we're adding negative three. Negative three is in this salmon color looking thing. They're very close, but different. So now we're going to add negative three to positive 11. So we start here, but we're going to go three to the left because it's negative. So one, two, three, and where do we end up? We end up at positive eight.
