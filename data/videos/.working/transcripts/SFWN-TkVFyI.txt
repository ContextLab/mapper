The number E has all sorts of amazing properties. Just as a review, you can define it in terms of a limit. The limit as N approaches infinity of one plus one over N to the Nth power. You could also define it as the limit as N approaches zero of one plus N to the one over Nth power. But what we're going to focus on this video is an amazing property of E, and E has many, many amazing properties, but this is the one that's maybe most relevant to calculus, and that's the notion that if I take the derivative with respect to X of E to the X, that it is equal to, drum roll, it's equal to E to the X. That, to me, is amazing. Let's just appreciate it for a second before we actually prove it. This is part of the graph of Y is equal to E to the X, and so what this says is the derivative of E to the X for any X is equal to E to the X, so the slope of the tangent line at any point here is equal to the value of the function. Let's just appreciate that. So right over here the value of the function is one, and the slope of the tangent line is one, here the value of the function is two, and the slope of the tangent line is two, here the value of the function is four, and the slope of the tangent line is equal to four. So I could just go on. This is just another amazing thing about E, and we'll see many more in calculus, But let's now prove that this is actually true. So let's just use our definition of a derivative. So the derivative with respect to x of e to the x would be the limit of delta x, or as delta x approaches zero, of e to the x plus delta x minus e to the x, all of that over, all of that over delta x. Now let's do some algebraic manipulation here to see if we can make some sense of it. So this is going to be equal to the limit as delta x approaches zero of, let's see, what happens, well, I won't skip any steps here. This is the same thing as e to the x times e to the delta x, this is just using our exponent properties here, minus e to the x over delta x. Just to be clear, I rewrote this right over here as this right over here. Now I can factor out an e to the x, and in fact, because e to the x is not affected as delta x approaches zero, I can factor the e to the x out of the entire limit. So let's do that. Let's take the e to the x out of the entire limit. Let's factor it completely out. It does not get affected by the delta x. So this is going to be equal to, factor that e to the x out, e to the x times the limit as delta x approaches zero of e to the delta x minus one, all of that over delta x. So now we're gonna get a little bit fancy with our limits. We're gonna do what's known as a change of variable. So I'm gonna say, let's see, I don't know how to directly find this limit right over here, but maybe I can simplify it, and who knows? Maybe I could get it into one of these forms up here. So what if I were to make the substitution, and let me do it over here. Let's say I would make the substitution that n is equal to e to the delta x minus one. So what would this be if we were to solve for delta x? Well, let's see, we could add one to both sides. n plus one is equal to e to the delta x. To solve for delta x, we could just take the natural logarithm, log base e of both sides, and we would get the natural log of n plus one is equal to delta x, and so we can make that substitution. This could be replaced with this, and what we have in the numerator over here can be replaced with n right over there. And what would happen to the limit? Well, as delta x approaches zero, what does n approach? So delta x approaches zero implies that n approaches what? Let's see, as delta x approaches zero, this would be e to the zero, which is one minus one, so it looks like n approaches zero, and you could look at it over here. As n approaches zero, right over here, natural log of zero plus one, natural log of one, that is zero. So as each of them, as delta x approaches zero, n approaches zero. As n approaches zero, delta x approaches zero, so then you can replace, if you make the change of variable from delta x to n, you could still say as n approaches zero. So let me rewrite all of this. That was the fanciest step in this entire thing that we're about to do. So this is going to be e to the x times the limit. Since we changed our variables, it's now going to be as n approaches zero, because as delta x approaches zero, n approaches zero, and vice versa. And this numerator here, we said, hey, that's going to be equal to n, n, over, delta x is now the natural log of n plus one. Natural log of n plus one. Now what does that do for us? Well, what if we were to divide the numerator and the denominator by n? So let's multiply down here by one over n, and let's multiply up here by one over n. Well, our numerator is just going to be equal to one. And what does our denominator equal? Well, here we can just use our exponent properties. All of this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, we have our e to the x out front, e to the x, and then we have the limit as n approaches zero. Our numerator is now one over, now I'm going to rewrite this just using our logarithm properties. If I have, I'll do it right over here, if I have a times the natural log of b, this is the same thing as the natural log of b to the a power, the eighth power. This is just natural log properties. So what we have down here, this would be the same thing as the natural log of n plus one. Actually, let me write it the other way around. One plus n, one plus n, I just swapped these two, to the one over n power. So the natural log of that whole thing. Now you might be getting that tingly feeling, because something is starting to look familiar. What I just constructed inside the logarithm here looks an awful lot like what we have right over here. And limit as n approaches zero, limit as n approaches zero. In fact, we can use our limit properties, this one isn't affected, what's really affected is what's inside the logarithm. So we could say that this is going to be equal to, and we're approaching our drum roll, e to the x times one over one over n, over the natural log, I'll do that blue color, the natural log of, I'll give myself some space, the limit, the limit as n approaches zero of this business right over here, which I could just write as one plus n to the one over nth power. So this is really interesting. What is this? What did I just, what do I have there in the denominator with this limit? What is this thing equal to? Well, we already said that is a definition of e. That is this right over here, which is equal to this over here. So this is equal to e. So what does this all boil down to? I think you see where this is going, but this is fun, we're downhill from here. This is e to the x times one over the natural log, the natural log of e. Well, the natural log of e, what power do I have to raise e to get to e? Well, I just have to raise it to one. So this gets us e to the x, and we're done. We've just proven that the derivative with respect to x of e to the x is indeed equal to e to the x. That's an amazing finding. That shows us one more dimension of the beauty of the number e.
