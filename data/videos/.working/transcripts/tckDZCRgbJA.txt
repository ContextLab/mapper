We are asked, what is a reasonable estimate for the limit of g of x as x approaches three? So what we have here in blue, this is the graph of y is equal to g of x, and we wanna think about what is the limit as x approaches three? So this is x equals three here. So what you need to do is think about what is the limit of this function as we approach three from the left, and we're also gonna think about what is the limit of this function, what does it appear to be from the graph as we approach this value from the right, and if it looks like we're approaching the same value, then that would be a reasonable estimate for the limit. And the reason why they say reasonable estimate is because we're gonna do it by inspection. We don't have a lot more information about the graph to know for sure, but from the graph, we can come up with a reasonable estimate. So pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. All right, so let's think about it, let's think about it in two parts. Let's think about approaching x equals three, or let's think about the limit as x approaches three from the left, as we approach x equals three from the left. So as we approach x equals three from the left, our graph seems to be, our graph seems to, if I just eyeball it, seems to be approaching the value four. So from the left, it looks like we are approaching four. Approaching, or let me write it this way, g of x approaching four. G of x approaching four as x approaches three from the left. Now let's think about it from the right. As x approaches three from the right, what does it look like g of x is approaching? Well it looks like g of x is approaching negative three as x approaches three from the right. So I could say g of x approaching negative three as x approaches three from the right. And so we have two different values here. When we approach from the left, it looks like g of x is approaching four. And when we approach from the right, it looks like g of x is approaching negative three. And so because of that, we would say that this limit right over here, it's reasonable to say that this limit doesn't exist. So I'll write does not exist based on looking at this graph right over here. And a good clue that it won't exist is the x value where we're trying to find the limit at. You see this jump in the graph right over here. It is discontinuous. It jumps from one value to another, which is a good clue that the limit might not exist here.
