We're told the sum of 600,000, 90,000, and two 10s can be expressed as which number? Why don't you pause this video, have a go at this before we do this together. All right, now the way I'm going to approach it is I'm going to think about what each of these parts of the number, how I can write them down just as a number, and then I'm gonna add them up. So if I wanted to write 600,000, how would I write that? Well, it would be six, and let's see, this would be 60 or six 10s, this would be 600s, this would be 6,000s, this would be 60,000s, this would be 600,000s. So 600,000s is this right there. And next, we have 90,000s. Well, I can do that same exercise. I'm gonna add it together. So this is going to be plus, actually, let me just write it here first. So 90,000s is, that's 90, this would be 900, that would be 9,000, that would be 90,000. Another way to think about it, I have a nine in the 10,000s place. So I have nine 10,000s, which I guess the same thing as 90,000s. So it's going to be the 600,000s plus 90,000. And actually, now let me, I'm going to set this up so I can add them together. So I have the place values lined up. And then I'm going to add to that two 10s. Well, this is just two. And if I put one more zero here, that's two 10s, or also known as 20. And how do I know? Or another way to think about this, I have the two in the 10s place. So that's two 10s. So that is going to be two 10s right over there. Another way you could think about everything we're doing here is this first column, that's your ones place. That second column, I'm just in a darker color, that's your 10s place. Your third column is your hundreds place. This fourth column is your thousands place. This is your 10,000s place. And then this one is 100,000s place. 100,000s. So it's 600,000s and nine 10,000s, which is the same thing as 90,000s. And then we have two 10s. But let's add it all up. And I am going to get, actually I could keep those place values there. I have no ones here. So I still have zero ones. I only have two 10s amongst all of these numbers. So it's still two 10s. I have no hundreds. So zero 100s, no thousands, zero thousands. I have nine 10,000s here. So I'll put a nine right over there. And I have 600,000s. So what I'm left with is this number right over here. And if we look at the choices, that's exactly choice C.
