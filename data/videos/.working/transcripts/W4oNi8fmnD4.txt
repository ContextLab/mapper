So we're told to select the diagram that represents two thirds times one fourth, and they give us some choices. Why don't you pause the video, have a go at this before we do this together. Okay, now let's do this together. So one way to think about this is this is two thirds of one fourth. So let me draw a hole here and I'll make it the same, roughly the same looking rectangle that we've seen in these choices. And let me start with one fourth. So to have one fourth, I could divide this hole into four equal sections. I'm hand drawing it, so it's not going to be perfect, but these need to be equal sections. That's pretty good actually, pretty good. So I think we all get that these are each fourths. And so if we wanted to focus on one of those fourths, we could look at maybe this one, and actually maybe I'll use similar colors to what they're using. So that is one fourth right over there. And then to think about what is two thirds of one fourth? Well, I could divide this hole into thirds and then take two of them. So let me do that. So let me take this hole and divide it into thirds. And then I can highlight two of those thirds. So this is a third and then that is a third of the whole. So maybe let me do this in a, well, I'll do the same color. So this right over here is one third, and then we have our second third right over there. And if I wanted to know what two thirds times one fourth is or what two thirds of that fourth is, I would look at where they're overlapping. So I could see here that two thirds of that one fourth is, are these two right over here, these two squares, I should say. And we could calculate what those actually are. We could see that when we have split the hole in this way, each of those squares are, we have one, two, three, four this way and three this way. So we have 12 squares and we've just doubly highlighted or there's an overlap in two twelfths of those. So we could say this is two twelfths. You might also recognize that as being one sixth. But that's not what they're asking us. They just want us to select the diagram that represents this multiplication. And so this first one right over here looks like they have a fourth, but they're multiplying it times one third. So I don't like that one. Here they have a fourth and they're multiplying it by two thirds. I like this choice. Here they have a half that they're multiplying by three fourths. I don't like that one either. So B is definitely our choice.
