On your math quiz, you earn five points for each question that you answer correctly. In the table below, x represents the number of questions that you answer correctly, and y represents the total number of points that you score in your quiz. Fair enough? The relationship between these two variables can be expressed by the following equation. y is equal to 5x. Graph the equation below. So you could look at a couple of your points. You could say, well, look, if I got zero questions right, I'm going to have zero points. So you could literally graph that point. If I got zero questions right, I get zero points. And then if I get one question right, and the table tells us that, or we could logically think about it, every question I get right, I'm going to get five more points. So if I get one question right, I'm going to get five more points. And we saw that in our table as well. We saw that right over here. One question, five points. We could also have plotted two questions, 10 points, any of these. But you only have to do two points to define a line. So it looks like we are actually done here.
