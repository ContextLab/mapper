At the grind house, Honduran coffee sells for $8 per pound, and Costa Rican coffee sells for $11.50 per pound. If one pound of Central American blend coffee contains 0.4 pounds of Costa Rican, so I did Costa Rican in this orange color before, so I'll do it again. So it contains 0.4 pounds of Costa Rican coffee and 0.6 pounds of Honduran coffee, I'll do the Honduran coffee in blue, that was our first statement, how much should one pound sell for? So they're really just saying, well, how much does it cost for me to buy 0.4 pounds of Costa Rican and 0.6 pounds of Honduran, and if I take that total, that's how much it's going to cost me to get one pound of my Central American blend. So let's just figure that out. The Costa Rican coffee, we're going to get $8 per pound. Oh no, sorry, it's $11.50 per pound. We have to be very careful. The Costa Rican coffee is $11.50 per pound. We could write it like this, per pound. And then we're going to multiply that times the number of pounds we want of the Costa Rican coffee in our blend. And we have 0.4 pounds of it. So times 0.4 pounds. The pounds cancel out, and you have 0.4 times 11.50. 4 times 11.50 would be 44 plus 2, which would be 46. So 0.4 is going to be 4.6. So this is equal to $4.6, or $4.60. Now, we'll do the same thing for the Honduran coffee. We're going to get 0.6 pounds. Well, first let's put the price here. It's $8 per pound. So it is $8 per pound, and multiply it times the number of pounds. We need 0.6 pounds of it. 0.6 pounds. And 8 times 6 is 48. So 8 times 0.6 is $4.80. So this is equal to $4.80. So that's how much we're going to have to spend on Costa Rican. That's how much we're going to have to spend on Honduran coffee. If we add them up, that's how much a pound of the Central American blend is going to cost. If you add up the pounds, you get a pound here. So the total cost is the total cost of a pound of the blend. Let's put it right here. 0 plus 0 is 0. 6 plus 8 is 14. 1 plus 4 plus 4 is 9. But the decimal in the right place is going to cost us a total of $9.40 for the blend.
