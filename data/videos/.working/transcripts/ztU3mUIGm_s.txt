We are asked, which of the following correctly shows the sum using the standard algorithm? So pause this video, have a go at that before we do this together. All right, what I always like to do when I'm trying to analyze someone else's work is just trying to do it myself. So if I have 647 plus 235, and when we say standard algorithm, that's just a fancy way of saying just the standard way that people normally add three-digit numbers like this. So for example, we can start here in the ones place, and we have seven ones plus five ones is 12. Well, 12, we can write that as two ones and then regroup 10 of those ones right over here. And then we have, let's see, we're going to have one, and actually we can already rule out this one right over here, B, because they didn't regroup those 10 ones. As one 10 right over here, so we don't see that here, but let's just keep going. So we have one 10 plus four 10. So one plus four is five, plus three is eight 10s, no need to do any regrouping, and then 600s plus 200s is eight hundreds. So the answer is 882, so we know that that checks out there, and we also had to regroup once right over there, those, that 10, and we see that over here. So we like choice C.
