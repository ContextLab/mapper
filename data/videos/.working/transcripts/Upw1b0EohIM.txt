So we're told G of X is a transformation for F of X. The graph below shows F of X is a solid blue line, so this is a graph of Y is equal to F of X, and G of X is a dotted red line, so that's the graph of Y is equal to G of X. What is G of X in terms of F of X? And they gave us some choices here, and I encourage you, pause the video and see if you can figure this out. Well, there's a couple of ways that you could think about it. One is if you just eyeball it, it looks like if you flipped F of X over the X axis, it looks a little bit like G of X, but G of X looks like a version of that that's diminished a little bit. So for example, if you were to flip it perfectly over the X axis, you would get something, you would get something that looks like, and I'm just going to sketch it, so if you just flipped perfectly over the X axis, you would get something that looks like this, and trying my best to eyeball it, it would look something like this. If you perfectly just flipped it over, it would look something like that. I might not get it perfectly right, but that would be this right over here, so let me be clear. If this is Y is equal to F of X, then this line right over here that I just drew, that would be Y is equal to negative F of X. So, because whatever F of X would give, you just take the negative of it, and you're flipping over the X axis. And now G of X looks like a diminished version of that. If I were to just eyeball it, it looks like it's roughly one third of this. So my initial guess, and we can verify this a little bit, is that this right over here is one third the value of this. So I would say it is, so G of X is equal to one third of negative F of X, or negative one third of F of X. And that is not one of the choices, which makes me extra cautious, but let me just emphasize why I like this choice. Because we said this is negative F of X right there, and it looks like for any X value, what G of X is is one third of that. So instead of getting to four, we're getting to a little bit over one. Instead of getting to three right over here, we're getting to one. Instead of getting to one right over here, we are only getting to one third. So it looks like it is one third of this line that I just hand drew, which is negative F of X, would be one third of negative F of X, which would be negative one third F of X. Once again, not a choice here, but let's actually look at some values. So if we said, let's see some values where it looks like we're hitting integer values. So right at, so for example, right at this point, right over here, it looks like F of negative seven is equal to negative one. It looks like G of negative seven is right, so it looks like G of negative seven is equal to positive one third. Positive one third, if I'm just eyeballing it. So that seems consistent with this, because if F of negative seven is negative one, you take the negative one third times that and you get positive one third. We can do that at a couple of other places. If we look right over, if we look right over here, it looks like F of negative one, F of negative one is equal to negative three, and it looks like G of one is negative one third times that. Negative one third times that is that point right over there, negative one third times negative three is positive one. So G of, I mean G's color and that red color. So we get, for that point right over there, we get G of negative one is equal to positive one. So once again, this is negative one third times this right over here. So I feel pretty confident in my answer. G of X is equal to negative one third times F of X. Once again, negative F of X, we just flipped over, and then multiplying it by the one third diminishes that, which we see right over there. So I feel pretty confident with my none of the above.
