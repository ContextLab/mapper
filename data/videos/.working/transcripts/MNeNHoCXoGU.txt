Find the least common multiple of 15x, 20, and x squared plus 5x. So when you're trying to find the least common multiple of a bunch of numbers, you want to break them down into their smallest constituent parts. And if you're dealing with regular numbers, non-variables, those smallest constituent parts are the prime factorization of those numbers. And if you're dealing with things that have variable expressions, you just want to factor them into their simplest possible components. You can't really call those prime factorizations. So let's try to do it. And once you do that, the least common multiple just needs to be the smallest number that can be factored into those constituents and just has those constituents in them. So let's factor each of them. So a 5 factor of 15x, this is the same thing as 15 times x. And 15, we could do a prime factorization here. 15 is 3 times 5, but 3 and 5 are prime. So we can factor this as 3 times 5 times x. That's the, well, for the coefficient we've done the prime factorization. And then x, that's as much as we can factor. We can break it down. We don't know if x is necessarily prime or not. It's a variable. Let's do the same thing for 20. So 20 here can be factored into 2 and 10. And 10 can be factored into 2 and 5. So 20 is equal to 2 times 2 times 5. And that's just a straight up prime factorization. Now let's do x squared plus 5x. x squared plus 5x, we can factor out an x. Both of these terms are divisible by x. So this is equal to x times x plus 5. If you factor out an x here, you just get an x. If you factor out an x out of 5x, you just get a 5. And so the least common multiple, so let me write it down, the least common multiple has to have the smallest number that has all of these components at least, so it has all of these factors in it. So let's just start with the smallest numbers and then we'll get to the variables. So it has to have at least two 2's, because we have two 2's here. We don't have any of them here, but it has to have at least two 2's. So you have two, let me do it in those pink 2's. So it has to have at least two 2's, 2 times 2. If it's going to be divisible by 20, it's also going to need a 5, we'll get to that in a second. So it needs to have at least two 2's. And then it needs to have at least one 3. It needs at least one 3 if it has any chance of being divisible by 15x. So it has to have at least one 3. None of these guys. So at least one 3. And then 5, if it has any chance of being divisible by 15x, it has to have at least one 5. If it has any chance of being divisible by 20, it has to have at least one 5. So it has to have at least one 5. This one 5 right over here will help ensure that it's divisible by both 15x and 20, although we haven't put all of the factors there. Although this is already divisible by 20, because you have the 2 times 2 times 5 here, this isn't quite divisible by 15x yet, because we don't have an x here. It is divisible already by 15, because you already have the 3 times the 5. You already have the 3 times the 5 here. And then you get to the x. This right over here has one x value. So in order to be divisible by 15x, it has to have at least one x here. And so this is already divisible by 15x. You actually have 15x right over here, 3 times 5 times x. It's already divisible by 20. You have 2 times 2 times 5. That is 20. Is it divisible by x squared plus 5x? Well, it does have this x here, but it still doesn't have an x plus 5 in it. It still doesn't have an x plus 5. So let me do that in orange. So the least common multiple also needs an x plus 5 over here. And so this is the least common multiple. If you want to multiply it out, to maybe simplify it a little bit, 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 3 is 12. 12 times 5 is 60. 60 times x is 60x. So this is 60x times x plus 5. And if we want to multiply it out, 60x times x plus 5 is 60x squared. I'm just distributing the 60x. 60x squared plus 60 times 5 is 300x. And there you go. The least common multiple.
