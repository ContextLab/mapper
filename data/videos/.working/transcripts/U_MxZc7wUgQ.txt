We're told Monica starts to use the standard algorithm to solve 804 minus 365. Here is her work. What number should Monica replace X with? So pause this video and have a go at this before we do this together. So it looks like what Monica's trying to do is because she's going place value by place value and she needs to figure out a way to subtract 6 from 0 and 5 from 4. So she decomposed certain numbers and then regrouped parts of it to others. But it's sometimes a little bit confusing to look at someone else's work and to see what's going on. So actually what I find useful to do is just do what I would have done doing the standard algorithm and that's just a fancy way of saying the standard way of subtracting numbers. And let's just see if I did it, what it might look like. So as I just mentioned, I can't subtract 5 from 4, I can't subtract 6 from 0. So I'm going to have to do a little bit of regrouping. Over here I have 800s. I can decompose this 800s into 700s and 10 10s. So then this is going to become 10 10s. Notice 10 10s plus 700s is 800. Now I'm making progress except I still need to subtract the 5 ones from the 4 ones. So let me decompose this 10 10s into 9 10s and 10 ones. And so if I add the 10 ones to the 4 ones that are already there, I end up with 14 ones right over here. And now I am ready to subtract. And if I wanted to do it, I could say 14 minus 5 is 9. And I could keep going, I could say 9 minus 6. But I've actually already answered the question because what's pretty clear is that this x here, this is this 9 right over here. What Monica did is first decompose that 800s into 700s into 10 10s. And then she decomposed that 10 10s into 10 ones and 9 10s. So this x right over here is a 9. And that's all they're asking us for. So we're actually not asking us to complete the subtraction. We could. 9 minus 6 is 3. 7 minus 3 is 4. And we're actually done. But x is this 9 right over there.
