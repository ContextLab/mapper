Let's say that f of x is equal to two x minus three, and g of x, g of x, is equal to one half x plus three. What I want to do in this video is evaluate what f of g of x is, f of g of x, and then I want to evaluate what g of f of x is. So first I want to evaluate f of g of x, and then I'm going to evaluate the other way around. I'm going to evaluate g of f of x, but let's evaluate f of g of x first. Like always, I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can work through it. So this is going to be equal to, f of g of x is going to be equal to, well, wherever we see the x in our definition for f of x, the input now is g of x. So we'd replace it with a g of x. It's going to be two times g of x, two times g of x minus three. And this is going to be equal to two times, well g of x is all of that business, two times one half x plus three, and then we have the minus three. And now we can distribute this two. Two times one half x is just going to be equal to x. Two times three is going to be six, so x plus six minus three. And so this is going to be, this is going to equal x plus three. x plus three, all right? Interesting. That's f of g of x. Now let's think about what g of f of x is going to be. So g of our input, instead of calling our input x, we're going to call our input f of x. So g of f of x is going to be equal to is going to be equal to one half times our input, which in this case is f of x, one half times f of x plus three. Plus three. You can view the x up here as the placeholder for whatever our input happens to be. And now our input is going to be f of x. And so this is going to be equal to one half times, what is f of x? It is two x minus three. So two times x minus three. And then we have a plus three. And now we can distribute the one half. One half times two x is going to be x. One half times negative three is negative three halves. And then we have a plus three. So let's see, three is the same thing as six halves. So six halves minus three halves is going to be three halves. So this is going to be equal to x plus three halves. So notice, we definitely got different things for f of g of x and g of f of x. And we also didn't do a round trip. We didn't go back to x. So we know that these are not inverses of each other. In fact, we just had to do either this or that to know that they're not inverses of each other. So these are not inverses. So let me write it this way. f of x does not equal the inverse of g of x. And g of x does not equal the inverse of f of x. In order for them to be inverses, if you have an x value right over here, and if you apply g to it, if you input it into g, and that takes you to g of x, so that takes you to g of x right over here, so that's the function g, and then you apply f to it, you would have to get back to the same place. So g inverse would get us back to the same place. And clearly, we did not get back to the same place. We didn't get back to x, we got back to x plus three. Same thing over here. We see that we did not get back to x, we got to x plus three halves. So they're definitely not inverses of each other.
