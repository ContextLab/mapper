Hello grammarians and historians and linguists and friends David here along with Jake Hey and Paige. Hello, and I want to continue our discussion of the history of the apostrophe in English and what I'm having Jake draw for me right now is an old English King because what's the story of the possessive apostrophe in English is Really the story of old English Like how did we get this like pages and jakes? How did we get that ending up as our possessive form in English with that apostrophe? Yes, because it didn't always used to be that way. It didn't always used to be apostrophe s. Oh, that's very nice. Jake Well, I try So that's King Aethilred, so okay, so when we're talking about you know this the possessive the possessive in English is is very strange because it's this relic from history of these forms left over from old English So here's here's this table this vastly simplified table English used to have these things called case endings And this is not a very this is like a super simplified version. These are all what are called the the strong Case endings that were strong and weak case endings for each gender and in English we had masculine feminine and neuter but the important thing to remember is that the Singular form of the neuter and the masculine was yes, and that just sounds like gobbledygook right now I get it. So let's take our King which in old English would have been Kining Right, and so if we're going to look at this crown well in old English, they would have just used the Latin corona So we're just going to refer to this as a hat So if we want to talk about the King's hat in old English, we would use the special Possessive ending the masculine possessive ending right because English had a million of these endings There was one where if you were the subject of a sentence you would use that ending if you were the object of a sentence You would use that ending the Norman invasion Locked all those off along with a bunch of English heads and now we have a much more simplified language for better or worse if we're talking about the King here we can refer to this this guy's hat as Sick King is hit which might not be the most accurate But you know Beowulf isn't around to correct me So if we're looking at this tuning here, right the possessive ending is this es If for example, we had and I'm gonna draw a queen that's not going to be as nice queen point hilda So the the difference between so so okay, so the old English word for Queen was perhaps unsurprisingly Queen And if we're going to talk about The Queen's hat we would use this singular strong feminine genitive ending which is equina right with an e Say Queen a hat and that's where all of this started Okay, so we have this really ludicrously complicated system. Even this table is simplified, right? Like I've left out half of it But ultimately what it boils down to is sickening his head Sequina head and as we move through history What happens is the French invade and they say ah, this system is very complicated Let us get rid of it and they do and it basically leaves us with by the time we get to Middle English The following so by the time we get to Middle English we have the King is Hata and we have The Queen is Hata and what's happened is this old English masculine and neuter Genitive this possessive form has just become the norm for everything. Everything is now Masculinized for better for worse. That's like everything has been simplified in that direction That's part one. Okay, so hold that in your head. Okay Then so that's middle English and then the printing press gets invented Now All of a sudden people are writing texts in English all over the place, but nobody knows how to spell yet, right? So we've got we've got that possessive form and then we have what's called the his possessive So at this point we're in modern English, right? And so some some bits of Middle English and Old English have fallen away but so for example We're still looking at something like the King is hat But What we're also starting to see in this one weird little period between like the late 16th and early 17th centuries this brief fad for this thing where people went the King His hat and if you can imagine like Post Elizabethan era Londoner saying this it kind of sounds the same To my mind the King is hat the King is hat right like like you're losing this this H is kind of swallowed So nobody knew how to spell because there was no way to spell right like Samuel Johnson had not yet written the first dictionary That's like 1720. I'm pretty sure There were no standards not because people were dumb or anything. Certainly not. It's just that these standards didn't exist like In the great scheme of history there's stuff that we do now You know that 400 years from now people are gonna look back at us and be like you used words to communicate You know like we have no idea So what starts to happen is? Is this this thing this the King his hat becomes more and more common To the point where people just sort of understand it as a given and it starts to get collapsed to save space So the King his hat Becomes the King's hat like so And it was just this one weird fad usage, which you could even argue is like a folk etymology or something made up It doesn't matter it happened. It's a tested in print and this is how it was collapsed And what happened as a result of this usage is the same thing happened to this. So the King is hat became The King's hat and it was just as well frankly because if you were talking about the Queen's hat in This his possessive context. It just you'd either have to do the Queen her hat Which is fine. I suppose or the Queen his hat which doesn't make a ton of sense And if you're wondering how there can be just this Random change in sound in a language without anybody orchestrating it Think of a time where you say something like I'm gonna go to the store. I'm gonna what are you really saying there? It's a contraction of I am going to but nobody actually says I am going to go right now They say I'm gonna go so words are always kind of mashing into each other If you remember from an earlier video when Paige and I were discussing the principle of least effort That's what Jake is getting at is the tongue is lazy. Don't feel bad, but the tongue is lazy Yeah, so what happened was you know this thing became And Pretty soon everything became this way So because of this one strange little fad what we call the Saxon possessive this thing the King is the Qantas Eventually just became Kings and Queens like so how elegant. Thank you Jake page does this square with how I mean this is how apostrophes are used in English But Jake and Paige you all were telling me about all the many ways that apostrophes are used in other languages around the world Right well, I think you know Punctuation marks are tools just like any other tools that human beings use they can be used different ways in different languages so in Dutch Apostrophes are used to make plurals what for words that end in a vowel so okay photo In Dutch is fo to and if you want to have multiple photos Well you have to throw in an apostrophe you have to throw in an apostrophe before the s No good reason why that's the case. That's just how they do it Conversely Dutch does not put an apostrophe for possession, so if you wanted to say Yann's book you would just say J a n s oh so it kind of retains this This genitive it can it retains this possessive form right same thing with German, so how do we say how do we say Jans book? Jans Book like that mm-hmm okay Same thing with German it German is a little bit more conservative and that it retains the yes, so Dasbuch might mean the book in German And if you want to say of the book or if you want to say the books you'd say des Buchs with that es ending tagged on to book oh The same one as in as in old English right so since English is kind of a cousin language to German Mm-hmm you can you can see which way the the ball fell on these two languages wow That's super cool Page any insights from Danish yeah, so from my limited you know expertise in Danish people Who speak Danish tend to abbreviate like all their words like everything gets shortened all the time sure? So the apostrophe is sometimes used in a similar way to how it is here to sort of show what's being shortened Okay, so in Danish to say something like take me with you mm-hmm you would say Tommy mill talk me man So then you can shorten that first word in writing by getting rid of the G And adding an apostrophe okay, this actually doesn't happen much it kind of has limited use but But it's similar to how how we use it for contractions in English sure and like how this possessive was formed It's interesting that the possessive the modern possessive in English is just a form of contraction. Yeah Well folks. Thank you so much for joining me on this journey through the wacky history of the apostrophe in English Thanks for taking us yeah, it was fun any time And remember folks you can learn anything David out page out Jake out
