Let's do a classic problem that really shows up every time you take a flight. I had to calculate something like this very recently because I had a flight from San Francisco to New York. So it says, your flight leaves San Francisco at 9.53am and arrives in New York at 6.26pm. The return flight leaves New York at 11.42pm and arrives in San Francisco at 3.19am the next day. Which flight is longer by how much? Let's tackle the first flight first. We're leaving at 9.53am and arrive at 6.26pm. Remember, this is 9.53am and this is the trick of this problem. This is San Francisco time. San Fran. San Francisco time. Then you're arriving in New York at 6.26pm. This isn't San Francisco time, this isn't Pacific time. This is now Eastern time, so this is New York time. To do this problem, something that you would have to know is that New York is 3 hours ahead of San Francisco. This is 3 hours ahead. When it is noon in San Francisco, it is 3pm in New York. When it is 1pm in San Francisco, it is 4pm in New York. The trick to doing this type of problem is to make sure everything is in the same time zone. Either put our San Francisco time in New York time, then we can subtract, or put the New York time in San Francisco time, and then we can subtract. Let's put everything in Eastern time. To do that, we have to take our San Francisco times and add 3 hours. We have to be careful here. You can say 9 plus 12, that will get us to 12.53. We have to be careful here because we are no longer at 12.53am. We are now at 12.53pm. You can draw a number line, or I should say a timeline here to make that clear. If you are at 9.53am, if you go 1 hour, draw a longer timeline over here. If you are at 9.53am, if you add 1 hour, you are at 10.53am. You add another hour, you are at 11.53am. If you are at another hour, you are now crossing the threshold from a.m. into p.m. You are now at 12.53, but it is no longer a.m., it is now p.m. In one way you can think about this first flight, we are leaving San Francisco at 12.53pm Eastern time. Now this is New York, Eastern time. Then we are arriving in New York at 6.26pm Eastern time. Now we can subtract this time from that time, especially because they are both p.m. That is the easiest way to do it. We could do it with a timeline, that would work as well. Just for simplicity, we are finishing at 6.26pm. We started at 12.53pm. Now you might say, how do you subtract 12.53pm from 6.26pm? The key here is to put both of them in military time. If you put it in military time, this is still going to be 12.53. If you put this up here in military time, you would add 12 to it. This is going to be 1826. I added 12 here to put that into military time. Now the subtraction becomes pretty straightforward. You have 6 minus 3 is 3 minutes. You have 2 minus 5 is essentially 20 minutes minus 50 minutes. Right here you are like, how do I subtract a larger number from a smaller number? We can borrow or regroup. We will borrow 1 hour from the 18 hours, or from this 8 hours right over here. That will become 7 hours. Now we have an hour to put into this spot. An hour is 6 10 minute periods. This is our 10 minute spot. You would add 6 to this. This is how it is different than traditional borrowing or regrouping. Since you have an hour, that is equivalent to 60 minutes. 60 minutes plus 20 minutes is 80 minutes. It looks like we took a 6 and added it to a 2, but that is because we are doing it in the 10 minute spot. We really took 60 minutes from out of here and added it to this 20 minutes and got 80 minutes. What that allows us to do is now subtract. 80 minutes minus 50 minutes is 30 minutes. Then you have 7 hours minus 2 hours is 5 hours. Then you have 10 hours minus 10 hours, and the 1's cancel out. We are left with 5 hours and 33 minutes. 5 hours and 33 minutes is how long our first flight takes. Let's try to tackle the second flight. The second flight is interesting because we are leaving at 11 42 pm and arriving in San Francisco at 3 19 am the next day. Once again, let's convert everything to Eastern time. We are leaving at 11 42 pm and then we are arriving at 3 19 am Pacific time. If we want to convert that 3 19 to Eastern, you add 3 hours. This is 6 to 6 19 am. There are two ways that you can do this. The simplest way might be with a number line, especially because you are crossing this day. We are crossing 12 am going into the next day. If we think about it that way, that is my timeline. If we are starting at 11 42 pm, it will take us 18 minutes to get to midnight. Then we get another 6 hours and 19 minutes. Then we have another 6 hours and 19 minutes to get to when our flight lands in San Francisco. This is all in Eastern time. This is 6 19 am Eastern time, although we are landing in San Francisco. We can literally just add these up. It is going to be 6 hours and then 19 plus 18 is 37 minutes. Clearly, going from San Francisco to New York took less time than coming back. We probably have a headwind of some type coming back. The other way we could have done it, and this is a little less intuitive because we are going to use some type of time frame that is not so obvious, you could have subtracted 11 42 from 6 19. You could have done it by doing something a little bit strange. You could have said that, so we are going to subtract 11 42. You want to subtract it from 6 19, but 6 19 is in the next time period. It will not be military time because in military time, you would just say it is 6 19 am. We are saying since we are subtracting from it something in the previous time period, in the previous 12 hour period, I am still going to add 12 hours to it. If we did not reset it at 1 am, if we did not go from 12 to 1, and we just kept going, so it became 1300 hours. This eventually would get to 18 instead of 6 19 am. This is not military time. This is some bizarre thing that I am just setting up so that the math works out. This you could rewrite since it is in the next time period from the 11 42. You could write this as 18 19. Then you can subtract. 9 minus 2 is 7. You have 1 minus 4, can't do that. Borrow an hour. That becomes a 7. If you borrow an hour here, you have 10 minutes here, you are going to be able to add 60 minutes to it. That becomes a 7. 7 minus 4 is 3. 7 minus 1 is 6. These cancel out. Once again, you get 6 hours and 37 minutes. Either way, the return flight is longer.
