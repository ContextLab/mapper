This video will review the available content on Khan Academy and discuss how our courses are designed to help students master the content they're learning. When learners interact with Khan Academy, they will experience videos, articles, practice questions, and instant feedback to help them improve. When we think about the resources Khan Academy contains, think of them split into two categories. The videos and articles are instructional content and the practice questions are practice content. Together, our goal is to provide learners a growth mindset experience and authentically learn until they have mastered the content. A key part of that practice is they'll get instant feedback about how they're doing alongside worked solutions to help them get back on track if they're not quite clear on a particular concept. We know many educators are familiar with Khan Academy's great math content, but many are unaware Khan Academy has a lot more to offer. Take a moment to explore the dozens of courses available to you, including courses in the sciences, finance and economics, art and humanities. Additionally, we have test prep content, including our digital SAT course created in partnership with the College Board. Another example that we're excited about here at Khan Academy is we're excited to introduce our financial literacy course. The financial literacy course helps students and their families understand money better, making it easier to reach goals and avoid financial problems.
