This is more of a request than a video, but I've been contacted by a news organization that's doing a piece on the Khan Academy. And they've asked me if I could find people who live in New Delhi, Bangkok, Dubai, or Hong Kong. And I think the reason why they asked for these cities is because they have bureaus in those cities, and they want to see how it's being used in all parts of the planet. So if you are a Khan Academy user and you've benefited from the site and are willing to have some people show up with cameras at your house to see how you use it and interview you, send me an email at sal at khanacademy.org. And in your email, tell me who you are, how old you are, what context you're using the Khan Academy in, and how it might have been useful. It doesn't have to be anything long and flowery. And I'll send those emails, I'll forward them over to the international news organization that approached me, and they may or may not contact you. And you need to get this to me as soon as possible. They just told me about this today. They're going to do the piece no matter what, but they would like to include some footage from some of you all over the world. I need the deadline is I'll make it the 5th of January, or essentially January 5th, 2010, which is tomorrow, Tuesday. A lot of you all are probably asleep as I put this video out, so I'll check my email in the morning on January 5th to see if any of you all have responded. Because they told me that they want to have this piece done by Wednesday. So if you email me by tomorrow morning, they might come over fairly quickly. So email me, www.salatkhanacademy.org. Tell me which of these cities you live in. Tell me the context and who you are of how you use the Khan Academy, and maybe we'll get you on TV.
