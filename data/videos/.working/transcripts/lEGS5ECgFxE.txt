A, B, and C are collinear, and B is between A and C. The ratio of AB to AC is two to five. If A is at negative six comma nine, and B is at negative two comma three, what are the coordinates of point C? And I encourage you to now pause this video and try this on your own. So let's try to visualize this. So A, A is at negative six comma nine, negative six comma nine. B, let's see, it's less negative in the horizontal direction, it's lower in the vertical direction. So maybe we could put B right over here. B is at the point negative two comma three, and at C it's going to be collinear, so we're gonna go along the same line. So let me draw that line right now. So it's going to be, it's going to be collinear, it's going to be collinear, and it tells us the ratio of AB to AC is two to five. So B is gonna be two fifths of the way. So let's say C is, I'm just trying to eyeball it right now. Let's put C right over here, and we don't know C's coordinates. Well the way we could think about it is to break it up into horizontal change in coordinate and vertical change in coordinate, and apply the same ratio. So for example, what is the horizontal change in coordinates going from A to B? Well let's draw that. Going from A to B, so this is A's x coordinate, it's at negative six, B's x coordinate is at negative two. So it's this change right over here. This is the horizontal change that we care about. Now what is that? Well if you start at negative six, and you go to negative two, you have increased by four. Another way of thinking about it is negative two minus negative six is the same thing as negative two plus six, which is going to be four. Now the ratio between this change, and the change of the x coordinate between A and C is going to be two to five. So let's call that change, this entire change. Let's call this x. So we could say that the ratio between four and x is equal to, notice this is the horizontal change between from A to B, just if you look on the horizontal axis. So the ratio of that, which is four, to the horizontal change between A and C, well that's going to have to be the same ratio. So it's going to be two over five. Now to solve for x, a fun thing might be just to take the reciprocal of both sides. So x over four is equal to five over two. We could multiply both sides times four. And we are left with x is equal to five times four divided by two, which is equal to 10. So the change in x from A to C is going to be 10. So what does that tell us about C's x coordinate? So we could start with A's x coordinate, which is negative 6, add 10 to it. Negative 6 plus 10 is 4. So we figured out the x coordinate. Now we just have to do the same thing for the y. So what is the change in y going from A to B? Going from A to B, what is the change in y? Well here we go from 9 to 3. We've gone down 6. Another way you could say it is 3 minus 9 is negative 6. To find the change, you could think of I'm just taking the end point and subtracting from that the starting point. Negative 2 minus 6 was positive 4. 3 minus 3 minus 9 is negative 6. Or you could just look at it. We've gone down 6. So we can write negative 6 here. Now our change in y is going to have to have that same ratio. So our change in y between A and C, let's just call that distance y. So our change in y is that's our change in y. And we're going to have to have the same ratios. So we could write that the ratio between our change in y from A to B, which is negative 6, to the ratio between our change in y from A to C, negative 6 to y is once again going to be equal to 2 to 5. Once again, we could take the reciprocal of both sides. y over negative 6 is equal to 5 over 2. Multiply both sides times negative 6. And we are left with y is equal to 5 times negative 6 is negative 30 divided by 2 is negative 15. So our change in y, or I guess our change in our vertical axis, which we're calling y in this case, is negative 15. So here, if our y value is 9, and if we were to subtract 15 from that, where does that put us? Well, 9 minus 15 is going to put us at 6. So the coordinates for point C are at negative 6. Almost made a careless mistake. 9 minus 15 is negative 6. I was wondering, this seems very low to be at point 6. So 4 comma negative 6 is a coordinates of point C.
