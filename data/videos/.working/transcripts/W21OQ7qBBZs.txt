What we wanna do in this video is try to graph the function g of x is equal to 1 1 by 2 times x minus three to the third power plus five. So if you have some graph paper in front of you, have a go at it, or even if you don't, just think about how you would try to graph this. All right, now let's work on this together. So this is really a transformed version of a function, let's call it f of x is equal to x to the third. And the reason why I know it's a transformed function is if I were to put a constant in front of x to the third, so if I were to say this is ax to the third, that's just scaling it, and that's analogous to what this 1 1 by 2 is. And then if I were to shift it to the right by three, then I would replace the x with x minus three to the third. And then if I were to shift it up, that's what the plus five is. So g of x is just f of x where I'm shifting it to the right by three and up by five, and I'm scaling it by one half. So let's just work on that a little bit. So what does f of x equal x to the third look like? Well, f of zero is zero, f of one is one, f of negative one is negative one, because negative one to the third is negative one, and then f of two is, let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Be right over there. On this side, it kind of falls off. Let's see, negative two would be negative eight. So negative two, negative four, negative six, you can't even see where I'm writing now, I'm off the screen. But the graph is going to look something like this. This is my best hand, my best hand-drawn version of what it would look like. So you could view this as almost the parent function, and now we just need to transform it. And we can do this really, well, we could do the shifting in either order, but let's scale it first. So if we were to do one half times this, so if we were to say one half, so let me write another function here, h of x is equal to one half times x to the third. Well, h of zero is still going to be zero, but h of one, instead of it being one, is now going to be one half. You have to multiply by this one half here. Similarly, h of negative one, instead of being negative one, is going to be negative one half. h of two, instead of it being eight, is now going to be half of that. It's now going to be four. h of negative two, instead of being negative eight, is now going to be negative four. So h of x would look something like this. h of x is going to look like this. One way to think about it is as x increases, it grows slower, and as x decreases, it decreases slower. That's what that one half does. And now, we want to shift it to the right by three. So if we take what was this point zero, zero, we shift it to the right by three, so we go there. So that's what that does. And then we shift it up by five. That's what that plus five does for. So one, two, three, four, five. What was it zero, zero, will now go there. And what was at one, one half is now going to, we'll go to the one to the right, and then half up, and then one to the left, and half down. That's analogous to this point right here. And then what was two to the right and four up? Well, once again, from this point, we go two to the right, and one, two, three, four up, and two to the left, and one, two, three, four down. And the graph is going to look something like this. And you bear in mind, I'm just hand drawing it, so it's not going to be a perfect drawing. But there you have it. That is my best hand-drawn version of G of X right over there.
