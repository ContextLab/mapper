Hello grammarians. So today I'd like to talk to you about the idea of concrete and abstract nouns and before we do that I'd like to get into some origins, some word origins or etymology. So let's let's take each of these words in turn because I think by digging into what these words mean literally what they mean and where they come from will get a better understanding of this concept. So both of these words come to us from Latin concrete comes to us from the Latin concreteus which means to grow together. So this part of it means grown and this part means together and refers to something that you know has has grown together and become thick and kind of hard to get through and physical. The connotation here is that this is a physical thing something that is concrete is physical. Abstract on the other hand means to draw something away. So something that is abstract is drawn away from the real from the concrete from the physical. So this is not physical. And we make this distinction in English when we're talking about nouns. Is it something that is concrete? Is it something that you can look at or pick up or or smell or sense or something that is abstract something that isn't physical but can still be talked about. So for example for example the word sadness is a noun right? This is this is definitely a noun. It's got this noun making ending this noun forming suffix ness. You know we take the adjective sad and we we toss this ness part onto it. We've got a noun. But can you see sadness? Is it something you can pick up? Sure you can tell by being you know observant and empathetic that your friend is sad, but it's not it's not something that you can pick up. It's not you can't be like a measurable degree of sad. You couldn't take someone's sadness put it under a microscope and say oh Roberta you are 32 degrees micro sad. You know it's not it's not it's not something physical. Concrete things on the other hand are things that we can see or count or measure just parts of the physical world. So anything you look at like a dog is concrete. A ball is concrete. A cliff is concrete. Happiness is abstract. The idea of freedom is abstract. Though the presence of freedom in your life may manifest in physical objects like oh my parents let me have the freedom to eat ice cream. Ice cream is you know a concrete noun. But freedom the thing that allows you you know the permission that you get from your parents to have ice cream. That's not a physical object. So that's basically the difference. So a concrete noun is a physical object and an abstract noun is not. This is why I really wanted to hit the idea that a noun can be a person place thing or idea. Because nouns can be ideas and those ideas tend to be abstract sadness happiness freedom permission liberty injustice all of these are abstract ideas. That's the difference. You can learn anything.
