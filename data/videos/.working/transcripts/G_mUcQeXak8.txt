Fill in the blanks to complete the equation. So they have 76,830 is equal to 6 10,000s plus blank thousands plus 800s plus 3 10s. So let's just think about 76,830. So if we write 76,000, 830. I'm going to try to color code it. 830. We could write this out as being the same thing. This is the same thing as 70,000 plus 6,000. The 7 is in the 10,000s place. So it's 7 10,000s, which is 70,000 plus the 6 is in the 1,000s place. So it's 6,000 or 6,000s, one could say, plus 800. Or you could say 800s plus 3 10s or 30 plus 3 10s or 30. And then there's a 0 1. So we could just write that out as 0 if we like. Now what we have on the right here is almost what they have on the right over here. Notice the 0, they didn't write that. So we can ignore that. The 0 really doesn't affect the value. We have 3 10s. We have 3 10s. We have 800s. But then that's where it starts to break down. Here we have 6,000s. So we're going to have to think about this a little bit. And then they have 6 10,000s, which is 60,000. We have 70,000s. So we've got to work through these two places right over here. So they have 6 10,000s, which is the same thing as 60,000. We have 70,000. So they essentially took 10,000 from here and regrouped it someplace. And since these two places are the same, they must have regrouped it into the 1,000s place. So let's try to do that. Well, let's get rid of 10,000 out of the 70,000. It becomes 60,000. So this becomes a 6. And then we're regrouping that into the 1,000s place. So we're going to add 10,000 to the 1,000s place. Now, what's the 1,000s place going to be then? Well, it's 10,000 plus 6,000. It's going to become 16. It's going to become 16,000s. This right over here is going to become a 16. So now what we wrote here looks just like what they wrote up here. This is 6 10,000s plus 16,000s plus 800s plus 3 10s. And we're done.
