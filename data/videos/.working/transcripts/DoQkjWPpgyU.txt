Hi, this is Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy, and I just wanted to let you know about the Breakthrough Junior Challenge in conjunction with Khan Academy. And for those of you who aren't familiar with the Breakthrough Prize, it's an incredibly prestigious set of prizes awarded every year to the world's leading mathematicians, biologists, chemists, physicists. And the idea is to award people who are literally moving humanity forward through the sciences and through mathematics. And what we're doing this year is we're going to extend it even further. We're going to have a Breakthrough Prize for high school students. That's what the Breakthrough Junior Challenge is. And the idea is to award people who can explain things in new and innovative ways, ways that can open up all of our minds. Because the big breakthroughs, the types of things that the Breakthrough Prize is awarded, these all start with new insights, new ways of looking at the universe. And these new ways of looking at the universe often happen with the people who are just starting to look at it. It might happen with young people, especially high school students. So we're going to give this prize. It's going to include a scholarship. It's going to include a prize for your teacher and a possible lab for your school. And we're going to give this for students who can explain either an existing concept in a new way, in a way that opens our minds, or a new idea that they came up with, or a new discovery that they came up with. So it's a very exciting thing to be part of. I really believe that we're going to hopefully inspire another generation of potential Breakthrough Prize winners. And I think even this competition is going to open our minds. It's going to make us all see the world in a new and exciting way. And if you win, you will come out here to Silicon Valley and you will share the stage with both people from Silicon Valley, leaders in the tech community, leaders in science. You'll share a stage with the winners of the Breakthrough Prize. And there will be a few Hollywood celebrities out here. It's going to be televised on national television. So this is going to be a really, really, really fun event. But most importantly, I think we might be able to move society forward. Thank you.
