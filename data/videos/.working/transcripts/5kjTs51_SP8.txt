Hi, everyone. Welcome. As you are joining, please feel free to put in the chat what brought you to this webinar today. We'd love to hear the things that you would like to learn and we will start in just a minute. Well, in honor of International Day of Women and Girls in Science, it is a pleasure to have these experts and leaders in science education with us. Special thank you to Donna and Melissa. You'll get to know them and their roles in today's session. I'm Sarah. I'm a proud former high school science teacher who's going to be leading today's discussion. And at Khan Academy, we are focused on helping districts drive student learning and close skill gaps. And AI is just one of those tools in the Educators Toolkit to be able to facilitate this. So let's hear what Donna and Melissa have to say. Melissa, you are a little bit of a celebrity in your own right. You've been featured on 60 Minutes and CBS News for your work in AI and science education. Can you share a little bit about what that's been like for you and what it means to you science education? It was a really exciting opportunity for me to actually be able to showcase the work that we're doing here at Hobart High School with Khanmigo, especially in the science classroom. I feel like sometimes science takes a backseat to some of the other subject areas like math and language arts because math and language arts are tested a lot more than science, a lot more than sciences, especially on a national level. And it was really cool to be able to get out there and show science and also show how we're integrating Khanmigo into the science classroom. And I also feel like it's an opportunity to show that science is a place where all other disciplines can come together to solve problems. And so that's really what we want to teach kids is to be really good problem solvers. We want to teach them critical thinking skills and the things that they're going to need to be able to solve the future future issues that we might be facing. We know that science careers are growing and we need kids to be able to not just not just feedback information to us that we've told them, but we need them to be able to build on that and deepen their understanding of scientific principles and apply those to solve real world problems. So it was really exciting to be able to be on 60 Minutes and kind of show my science classroom a little bit. Yeah, that's great. I love the whole problem solving piece of it. I think that's what kind of drives us all to science and being a science keeper. But, Donald, let's go to you. What specific science skill gaps have you seen in students? How have you aimed to tackle these in the past? And then how do you think AI helps with some of those skill gap challenges? Yeah, absolutely. So one thing that I noticed with my ninth and 10th graders is that they were coming from middle school and they were coming with huge variations in what they were able to do and what they knew. And so it was really critical to make sure that I got them all on the same page right before we started a lesson. And this also applies to students when they're absent a lot too. So this usually helped with that. And so one thing that I would do is start off my lessons with some sort of hook or an opener, something that was relatable to all my students and something that we can consistently come back to to build on our knowledge. So that was one big gap and one big struggle for me as a teacher is to try and make sure I'm hitting my students and meeting them where they're at, hitting my context properly, and trying to blend what they knew and what they were able to do with where I wanted to get them to. So that was one. And then one other I'll talk about, and I know Melissa can talk to this one a little bit as well, is a skill gap that I think we see in not just science, it's also in other domains, is students being able to explain their thinking and being able to explain how they got to the conclusions that they got to explain their reasoning, apply the knowledge that they just learned. Because it's not just about the definitions, it's also about how did you get there? What was your thought process to get you there? And some of the ways that I resolved that when I was back in the classroom, just paper and pencil, just have the kids writing it out. Because often you think of your shy students and for them to be able to raise their hand in front of all their peers and practice explaining their thinking, that's not going to happen. So just paper and pencil usually as technology advanced, we started using our Google forms and having them type them out. But ultimately that all comes back to the teacher. All of those 30 kids, five classes, that's all coming back to you and you need to give them each feedback. And that happens often in science class where they're explaining their thinking. So while the human in the loop is super important there, it's also very, very time consuming to be able to do that every time. So I'm going to kick it over to Melissa, who's actually come up with some really awesome ideas utilizing AI and Conmigo to help with some of these issues that we run into. Yeah, absolutely. Con is just a buffet of opportunities, Con and Conmigo, to help bridge those skill gaps. I too notice a lot of skill gaps. Some of them are, as they're moving up from middle school, some of them are still existing because of the pandemic. So in chemistry I see some math skill gaps that are there. And sometimes I'll just use Con Academy content. So if we're having an issue with something like rounding when we're doing significant figures, I'll identify something in Con Academy in the content that is there to help students maybe remediate that skill gap just a little bit, especially if I notice it across the board. I can also individualize that to students. And the really nice thing about the AI component is that you, they have a companion in the corner, Conmigo's in the corner for them. So as they're working through some of the activities and problems that are in Con courses, they can get real time tutoring and they can, that can kind of help them step by step. And they can explain their reasoning and the way that they're thinking about it. And I think it makes it overall okay to be wrong and okay to maybe not understand something. And so it's less intimidating when you're with Conmigo or you're with AI to make a mistake than it is to make a mistake in the front of the classroom. And so in my classroom, we also use Tutormee math and science. That's the learning activities for students. And so I will allow students to have that open during bell work or during an exit ticket. Because sometimes the most intimidating thing is to have, I mean, we were all, we all went to school when you popcorn around the room and you start calling on students and you're terrified. You're absolutely terrified that you're not going to be able to answer the question. And so if you have that there and you can maybe, whoof, I really, I thought I got it yesterday or I thought I got it during class, but I really don't get it. They can type in a few sentences and that exchange maybe deepens their knowledge if they already understood, or maybe it helps scaffold them. So it is like a live scaffold that can't be in all places at all times. And so it does help kind of plug in those gaps. And I love that it adapts to the level of my learner. And one of the things that I've been trying to do, and I've been playing with quite a bit more is we're able to assign those activities like Tutormee math and science in ConMigo. And I can customize the discourse with a prompt. And so I know that students are going to be guided down a path towards where I need them to go. But at the same time, the AI is going to adjust the level of communication with where that student is at. So when we talk about adaptive assessment, when we talk about scattered skills, when we talk about level learning, this is exactly what AI offers that I've been trying to do, right? I mean, absolutely, every single teacher out there is trying to level learning. But sometimes you're trying to level learning to 32 different kids, and you're, you sometimes end up with the kids that you know are super struggling. But what happens to the kids that are in the middle, and what happens to the kids that need enrichment when you're doing that. And so it is able to customize the learning experience for the student based around what I want the discussion to be about in my science classroom, which to me is how you really address you really address gaps as you meet the learner right where they are. And you scaffold and that's what we do as teachers, but you can also scaffold with the AI. Now, so Melissa, let's stay on that path a little bit. You're talking about differentiation and how you can really meet the students where they are to identify their skill gaps. Can you go a little bit further then and talk about how you use Conmigo and student engagement? What are you seeing of students being engaged more in your classroom by using Conmigo? I have great examples of engagement. I want to just start with one that happened around final exam time. And this came from one of my colleagues. So we teach the same course. And in another course, one of the students like absolutely aced the final exam. And this was in a higher level dual credit AP level course. They absolutely aced it. And you know, the teacher said, well, what was your strategy? And she said, well, I took your review for the final, and I put it into Conmigo. And I asked Conmigo to make similar questions for me, especially with the questions that I was struggling with. And so it empowers students, it helps them build confidence. It also, I mean, I think our whole job as teachers is we have to get away from IDK, which is I don't know, right? So instead of just saying, I don't know, we're teaching students how to behave when they don't know. And so when you don't know the answer, and that's really what it what about if you're going to enter the workplace, you're going to go to college, how are you going to behave when you don't know? And AI is one of the tools that our students are going to have in their tool belt, regardless of where they go next in life. And so when we start to reinforce those behaviors, we start to see students as they learn to communicate, and they learn to interact with Conmigo or, or any other AI, is that they are learning that they can expand on their own thinking. And they're learning that they can do that through dialogue and discourse. And I think those are really important things for students to learn in terms of skills for later on in life and skills today. What else do I have students do? I guess just again, going back to bell ringers or exit tickets, I don't have a place to start. Okay, you don't have a place to start. So let's think about where might we start. And like you said, I said earlier, and Donna said, you can't be in all places at once. But students are building the competence to go ahead and open that up and say, okay, I'm just gonna ask a quick question. I really don't know. And I don't know how many of you grew up with back of the book answers. I lived for those. I hated that they were only on the odds. But it's also a place where my students go to just make sure they're on the right track, right? So, you know, you've got this back of the book that you're flipping to. And sometimes this back of the books is just this isolated answer that's sitting there. And you're like, I didn't get that answer. And so now I'm off the rails. You don't have to be off the rails anymore. And so when they get away from me, and they're at home at night, and I can't tell you through the years how many videos that I made and sent to kids answering questions, because they knew they got the wrong answer, but they didn't know how to work the problem. And I'm not getting that as much anymore, because they have a personalized tutor that they can go to and ask those questions and get that resolved before they come in the next day. I'm also having less examples of incomplete homework. So I used to walk into the classroom and be like, Okay, were there questions? Yeah, I didn't get the whole assignment. I just didn't get it. Okay, what didn't you get? Let's start here. A lot less of that. So I'm getting a lot more of I really struggled with this one. And I did ask Conmigo, but I still I'm still kind of I need more practice, or I'm needing more explanation. And so we're really getting into a level where we're able to move the learning forward. I don't know if I answered the question. You did. You did great job. Okay. And then even to add to that student engagement piece, in the districts that I work with, one of the Conmigo teacher tools that I really like to, you know, put on to teachers radar is the real world context generator. Because we've all had students who don't want to go into science who aren't going to go down that scientific path, maybe they wanted to go into the trades. So you can take the concepts that you're teaching, like mitosis, and have Conmigo relate that to plumbing or carpentry or whatever that student wants to do. And Conmigo can do some really great connections between those things. So if you want to engage students about why do I have to learn this, right, the age old question that we always get, that Conmigo teacher tools are really powerful one to help make those connections of why those things are important, no matter what route you want to go to in your career. So yeah, student engagement is definitely a key piece of AI in education. Don, I'm going to move over to you. How do you see AI transforming science education beyond just saving teachers time? Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, transforming science education is a big ask, but you know, it's incremental. And so what I think of first is that teachers are wearing a ton of hats today. They're doing more than just developing and delivering their curriculum for their students. There's a lot going on. And the hope is that technology as it's done and AI will help teachers save time and help them actually be able to focus on the parts of teaching that they're most passionate about, right, and be able to release their grasp on some of the the tedious tasks that maybe they're not as passionate about. And that's going to allow our teachers, our science teachers, to be able to focus on whatever it is that they're into. So maybe it's differentiating for their struggling students, and they can make really, really cool new ways that they can actually reach all of those kids because they have a little more time on their hands. Or maybe for another teacher, their jam is creating activities that integrate and align with what's going on in science today. And that could be something that they have more time for. One that I was really passionate about and that was always a little bit of a struggle was allowing teachers to be that mentor or that coach, that guide on the side, who's actually helping them to develop those soft skills that they need to become independent learners and to become functioning members of society. I feel like, you know, if there's less time spent on grading little tedious things and giving them feedback on every single thing that they hand you, there's more time to have a conversation with the kid afterwards and talk about, well, what does this feedback mean to you? What are we going to do differently next time? And develop those skills, which are just important as the chemistry and the science skills, in my opinion. And so I think that this technology is ultimately going to, you know, support us in doing some of the things that we're already doing, but allow us to do them at a higher fidelity and in a more sustainable way. I think that is critical for us as teachers. Melissa, anything to add to that? I would just say in terms of transforming science education, I'm doing a lot more experimental design because students do have access to ConMigo to kind of fill in those gaps. But instead of maybe doing a prescribed lab, like last year with gas laws, I gave students a list of materials and I had them create a problem statement and figure out what they wanted to investigate and then design an experiment. So if it was a pressure volume relationship or a pressure temperature relationship, the students were guiding that inquiry. So I think it changes the scope of what we're able to do when they can step out of the box and they have, they're using AI to help them, and their knowledge, obviously, to help them investigate problems and then connect back to how is that like something that happens in the real world, like maybe a bicycle tire going flat or something like that. So again, just stepping out of my comfort zone and stepping out of prescribed labs, of course, within standards, within the bounds of standards and within the bounds of safety. And you know, you have to get your experiment approved by your teacher and those types of things, but I think it's allowing my students to think more out of the box and be more creative and be more in the application phase of scientific knowledge and some discovery, because for some students, it's their first go at it. I was talking with another teacher who teaches physical science and she's like, you know, do you have anything on building catapults? And I was like, you know, you could give the kids a list of materials and you could have them go out to ConMigo and see what they come up with in terms of a design so that they're unique instead of prescribed. And so I think it just puts a different dynamic in the science classroom. And again, that's where I would use tutoring, math and science. I might even do that as an assignable task. So now we're able to assign in tutoring, math and science so that I'm having a bit more control over the initial statement and what they have available and things like that. So I see that as being a way to transform. Another thing that I've done is I've used teacher tools, I've used lesson planning, I've also used just the open chat to plan problem-based units. So I planned part of what you saw in 60 minutes was a problem-based unit where a local water supply was contaminated. And so I used ConMigo to help me build several weeks of lessons that went along with that, that had inquiry labs that went around, went along with it. And it was our own, like we made it our own. I adapted lessons based on where the kids were. So I was able to go in to ConMigo, adjust my lesson plans based on where my students were. If I noticed a huge skill gap somewhere, we were able to go in and plug into that. If we needed to do a little bit of background research on something that we hadn't gotten to yet, I was able to use ConMigo to do that. So again, I just feel like it gives me limitless potential as a teacher in terms of what I can do for my students to really deepen their learning and really get them acting and behaving like problem solvers and scientists. And I've seen that theme of student engagement, right? It seems like those types of activities where you're letting them create their own problems, that's engaging, right? Instead of just, hey, here's a lab, follow these steps and write your lab. That's life. I mean, it really is life though. I mean, no one is standing there with a lab when you get to your first job saying, okay, here, you're going to follow this exactly. And don't make any deviations. And we know exactly what you want you to know at the end. Nobody's doing that. That's not even the real world. And that's not how things work. And so really, it's those skills, the in-between skills, the conversations, the talking with your group, the, I don't want to call them arguments because they're certainly friendly discourse that occurs in my room. It's not, but I mean, there's some passion that comes out and kids when they have ownership of what they've designed and what they're doing, they become very passionate. They become able to defend it, which honestly, don't we want that? Don't we want to know something so well that we can defend it? So, and Melissa, I want to ask you a question before we jump to our next one, because you've been talking a lot about your students working with it. Did that take some time to teach them how to talk with AI and Conmigo? 100%. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, you need to encourage, like you have to kind of prompt, well, they'll put it in, they want the immediate answer. Okay, so do I. I mean, really, don't we all just want the immediate answer? But I think what students are starting to see through dialogue, and I think this was even spoken in the 60 Minutes piece, is that really when you are having this dialogue and you are integrating your own ideas with AI and then expanding on them, that's really where your deeper, better answer is going to be. And so yeah, there was a lot in the beginning where they would say, how many, like, here's the problem, solve this for me. And it's asking, they're like, it's asking me another question. That question is why I was okay with allowing AI in my classroom, specifically Conmigo. Okay, if you're not asking my kid another question, I'm sorry, they're not my kids, my student, another question, but they feel like my kids sometimes, then I don't want them to just get the answer. I want them to have the dialogue. And I'm like, well, let's answer back. You know, so a lot of them were wanting the immediate response. But I think they're figuring out that it's really where the learning is taking place. And then they understand. Quick answers can come from anywhere. So if you're after the quick answer, we always have this discussion. If you're after the quick answer, you can get it a lot of different places. That's always been around. But if you're after the understanding, this is how the understanding takes place. When you ask me a question, and I ask you a question back as your teacher, it's not because I don't know the answer, it's because I want you to think about it. And so that's what makes me comfortable in my classroom, using Conmigo, when I know a lot of teachers are afraid to use it, because they don't want them cheating. And they don't want, you know, I get all of that, it made me very comfortable seeing it firsthand, that it's not just giving them the answer that we're deepening the level of understanding. So, Melissa, you kind of just touched on other teachers, maybe in your building or even in your apartment, who are a little more apprehensive about using Conmigo. Can you speak to a little bit about how your your district has helped kind of support this and support those teachers who may be apprehensive? And, and are they coming around a little bit? Or what's that culture like, from a teacher perspective? Oh, absolutely. I mean, absolutely. I think as a teacher, and I think this is all our initial response is, you mean, AI, it's a big word, and it's a big idea. And it has unlimited, scary potential, right? And so I think everyone's looking at it and saying, but I am the best with my students. I still feel like I'm the best with my students. But I also realized that I'm limited, just in terms of being one individual in a classroom of 32 individuals, or however many students you have in your classroom. In terms, I'm missing a lot. There's a lot that I miss that I'm not able to get to. And so I think one of the things for our district is, I mean, obviously, we've done extensive amounts of training. There was a pilot group that went through. That builds a level of comfort when you see the way that the AI actually responds. You have to allow teachers the opportunity to engage and teach as a teacher with, say, Conmigo Tutor, Remed, Life and Science. And there is a toggle switch. You can switch it over. You can be a student. So you can see how it's going to interact. And it kind of builds that confidence that, yes, this is going to interact with the student in the same way that I would. That's not just going to allow them to cheat, give them the answers. But as I think the cheating is the big thing, for a lot of teachers, the big issue, I don't want them cheating. And then also, just that, that fear of, well, then, you know, and people say, Oh, then AI can just teach the class. I would argue that my classroom has become more human since I started using AI. And what I mean is the level of connectedness in my classroom between myself and my students, based on things like, say, Lesson Hook, Teacher Tool Lesson Hook, that I'll create, whereas I might have just started maybe with a bell ringer, reviewing old knowledge, I might start with a bell ringer or with a lesson hook that engages the students, gets them having conversations with one another. That's a way that I've used AI to create more human connection in my classroom. So I think just having those solid examples of the ways that teachers have used AI to increase student communication with one another and the teacher, and student engagement with one another, the course material, and the teacher. So I think those things help when you see it in action, help allay fears that this is going to take over, or that we don't need teachers anymore. I think quite the opposite. I'm more connected to my students than I've ever been. Now that AI is a piece of the puzzle, because quite honestly, I just think it makes me think out of the box. It makes me try new things. Because, you know, I thought I was really good at what I did. And my lectures are pretty awesome. And I don't know why you wouldn't love my lecture as much as I do. And so I also know that that maybe isn't the way that all students learn. And so I've gotten out of my box quite a bit. And it's been through using like, I'm not an idea generating person. But if I go to lesson hook, I'm going to get three ideas right away. And I'm not stopping there. Because then you can use the AI to help you make, if you need to make a student lab document, or you need to make an introductory activity that you put in Canvas, I don't stop there. I make it do it all for me, of course, with my feedback and my input. But it also changes the vibe in my classroom, which is just really cool to see. So it's a place where it looks collaborative. I had a teacher walk in, one of our MTSS teachers came in the other day to bring me something. And she's like, Oh, my gosh, your classroom management's awesome. I'm like, it's not really my classroom management. These kids are just way into what they're doing right now. And so it's, it's really cool. Yeah. And it kind of brings back to what Donna had mentioned about having time to work on these soft skills and to make connections with your students that we all want to do as teachers, but sometimes we're just so bogged down in the details that that kind of gets swept under the rug, unfortunately, too much. But so Donna, what advice would you give to district leaders who want to start integrating AI into their science instruction effectively? Yeah. So we our content team actually visited several schools in Texas, two weeks ago. And we saw a lot of teachers who are quickly adopting this. And then we also saw a lot of teachers who are a bit more hesitant. And so some of the things that I would say to help with those conversations with the latter group would be the first try and pinpoint what it is that they're struggling with your teachers that is, you know, what, what are their needs? Because I think it varies. It varies a lot based on how many years they've been teaching, what age group they're teaching, the domain. So you want to try and figure out what are you struggling with right now? How are you resolving those issues, if at all, and likely you'll see that it's probably some form of an unsustainable system or there's nothing there. It's just kind of like, oh, I'm just kind of winging it. Because again, there's so much going on. And I think that is where the conversation can begin. And you can step in and start talking about some of the ideas that Melissa shared, shared a ton of ideas, and that both of us have shared throughout this webinar, and they can start to step in and make those, you know, make those a reality. Because I think that ultimately, the conversation does need to make sure it spins toward this idea that AI technology, they're not the final solution. They're not the final answer, they're not going to be everything. They're not going to replace teachers, as Melissa says. They're going to offer some relief, right? They're going to give back some of that time. They're going to provide you some support. And it's going to make it so that you can focus on the parts of your teaching that you love the most. And it does take some finessing. I think Melissa was touching on this, where you can get Kanmigo to create you something, but you do need to do a little work with it. So that's that needs to be part of the conversation as well. You do know your kids best. And you do. There's that bell, Melissa. You do know your kids best. It's real. I know she's in the real real classroom right now. But yeah, just kind of linking it back to to the context that they're in at the moment, the problems that they're trying to resolve at the moment, because the list is endless. We know every day you get home, and there's still a million things to do that you're not going to be able to get to. So utilizing this technology and controlling it too, and saying, I'm not going to give away that part of my what I love about teaching. I love making creative, differentiated parts of my assignments and my assessments. So I'm not going to give that to Kanmigo. I'm going to give something different to it. That's going to make me better at the things that I love doing and the things that I am good at doing. So that's that's how I would probably start that conversation. But also curious, Melissa, what you're what you might say to give district admin some tips on this. Just in terms of I would start small in terms of integration and just know that there's going to be a learning curve. I would, you know, and again, I'm modeling this off of my experience. And I think my experience here in school city of Hobart has is always it's always unique and it's always powerful because the school city of Hobart does provide us with so many resources. And so I think just the starting small in terms of integration, but also just really setting some benchmarks and some guidelines in terms of how you want your students utilizing AI. And one of the things that we did here in school city of Hobart is talk about a continuum of AI and how much you wanted it to be a part of your classroom and your assignments. And that was more of a consensus activity where teachers came together and we really talked about what that continuum would look like and where you were on that that comfort continuum. So if you're comfortable with using it as a tutor, but you're not comfortable with letting students use it for writing, which at that time there wasn't writing coach. So now I mean, honestly, limitless, right, with writing coach. But again, setting realistic benchmarks, we do even last week, we had one of our math teachers do a training on Bookit. So just a small piecemeal integration training, so you're not overwhelming everyone. But hey, go back and try this. I don't think there's a single teacher that I know that didn't try it because how can you not try it because it integrates, integrates directly into Bookit and then you can play and you've got this engagement strategy for your students. So I think just the little starting small, like I always start when someone asks me, like, where did you start? Start with lesson hook in terms of my teaching five minutes, right? So it took me, it would usually I can spend between five and 10 minutes and just change the trajectory of my whole day. So I would share that with other teachers. So definitely and draw on the experience of other teachers and draw on the experience of other districts and what other teachers have to say in terms of the benefits that it's shown in their classroom, not only for themselves, but for their students. And I think it really sells you when you see your students building confidence when you know that your students go home and that they have access to a one in one on one tutor that's going to talk with them in a, in a Socratic way, asking them questions the way that you would ask them questions instead of just giving them the answers. So I think just my advice is to really, you have to try it, but you have to start small and you have to let teachers really see the benefit. And I don't know any teachers. I know, I don't know any teachers that have seen the direct benefit that do not use it willingly and as an extension of what they're able to do for their students in the classroom, because why wouldn't you want your students to have one more tool in their toolbox and be able to empower themselves and be able to build confidence and be able to learn how to ask those questions when they don't know what to do. And that's the thing. We want students to know how to behave when they don't know what to do in science. It's a lot about finding answers, but it's also a lot about asking really great questions. And so the more we can get students engaged with asking their own questions in any subject area and, and gaining a deeper understanding of those through the incorporation of AI, I think is a win-win for everyone. Right. Donna, any final closing thoughts from you today and things that you want our fellow science educators to walk away from? Yeah, I think, Melissa, you hit it really well on that last one, going incremental with taking on these new ideas. There's so many tools out there, right? And there's so many things that we're asked to try out. So trying it incrementally and seeing, you know, how does this work for me? I would say teachers, try it yourself before you hand it off to your students. You know, we would never give our students a lab before we've tried it, unless you're in your first year, then you make that mistake, right? You're like, whoops, never again. So trying it yourself, seeing, you know, how does this thing work? What are its limitations? What are some of the things we can laugh at about it because it's not doing it well, you know, like that's how technology is and what can it actually do to help with all the tasks that are on my plate? And how can it, I love, Melissa, your spin on it is very, it's close to my heart in getting these students to have those independent skills and to be able to function independently out in the real world when they get out there. We're both high school teachers. So we're seeing these kids at their sophomore year when they're really starting to integrate into society and with their friends and everything. So it's cool to be able to have something that's supporting us in all of those aspects of what we do for these students. It's been so great to hear both of your insights and expertise, especially on today, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. And as you've heard from Melissa, Hobart has strategically implemented Khan Academy and Khanmigo at their district with a district partnership. Here is a link if you want to learn more about partnering with our team. Aviv, before we end, any questions in the chat that we need to respond to? Nope, not today. Thanks. Okay, great. Well, thank you for joining us today and onward. You. Hi.
