Hi everyone, Sal Khan here from Khan Academy. And many of y'all know about another project, another not-for-profit that I've been involved with known as schoolhouse.world, which is all about giving folks free tutoring. And we do that by finding amazing volunteer tutors. Now the tutors we've been finding, they found a lot of reward just being able to tutor other folks, but we wanna make sure that they also get other rewards. Because if you can tutor something, not only does that mean that you know the material, but it also means that you can communicate. You have empathy. You wanna spend your time doing good for others. So we were excited last year when University of Chicago said that they were going to use someone's tutor reputation as a way to evaluate students applying for University of Chicago. And just a few weeks ago, MIT also announced that they were putting schoolhouse.world profiles as an optional thing that students could submit and the schools will look at them. To get a sense of the amazing tutors we're finding, this right over here is the tutor profile in the transcript for Karen G, who's a high school student. And you can see that she's hosted a ton of sessions, 543 learners impacted, 33 countries reached, 864 positive ratings. And you can see what people are saying about her. My friend and I have been trying to go to every single one of your sessions for the past few weeks and we literally love you. And we can go after page after page of what everyone is saying about her. And then what also fellow tutors are saying. So she's getting feedback to become a better and better tutor. And we also have the certification mechanism which is qualifying her to tutor in specific units to show all of the things that she has gotten mastery in. This right over here is the tutor profile for Kate Pierce. So once again, another incredibly amazing high school student, 326 sessions hosted, over a thousand positive ratings. And what people are saying about Kate right over here. She was very reassuring and checks in with us whenever we needed help or got a question wrong, very helpful and patient and broke things down. These are things that you can't get just through traditional transcripts. The ability of someone like Kate to communicate and empathize with other folks. So if you're a university or an employer who's really interested in these types of students, I encourage you to click on that form in the link on this post and we can reach out to you and figure out how we can build a relationship so that you can discover amazing talent from the tutors at schoolhouse.world. So any young folks out there, especially high school students or college students who are interested in tutoring, I encourage you to check out schoolhouse.world and I am going to work with you and work for you to ensure that the rest of the world, college admissions officers and eventually internships and employers and scholarships, recognize that one of the best ways to prove what you know and give back to others is to tutor on schoolhouse.world.
