Hello grammarians, welcome to the last and strangest part of the irregular verb, the truly irregular. Yes friends, here I have compiled all the weirdest, all the wooliest, all the eeriest and spookiest forms of verbs that don't otherwise fall into other categories. So we can't say that they end with a changed ed, we can't say that they end with an en, and we can't say that there's a vowel shift. We've already covered those. This is the time for the weird stuff. First up, U-G-H-T. Oh, what a strange collection of letters that is to be found in English. So we take a word like teach, and in the past tense it's taught. Likewise, catch becomes caught, and bring becomes brought. Yes, that's really strange. There are only a couple of words that behave that way. It's also pretty weird and pretty rare for there to be a vowel shift from the present to the past, and also a duh sound. So for example, we take the word flea, which means to run away, and in the past it's fled. Likewise, in the present we say say, and in the past we say said. So that a becomes e, and that e becomes e, and it's this weird vowel shift that's also followed up by a duh sound. There are some words for whom time does not exist. These are verbs for whom the present tense is the same as the past tense. Prepare to have your mind blown. The past tense of bet is bet. The past tense of set is set. The past tense of hurt is hurt. Yeah, it's weird. Finally, there are some helper verbs or auxiliary verbs called modals that are super weird, and have these properties that aren't repeated anywhere else in English. So present tense can becomes past tense could. I can stand on my head, or I could stand on my head when I was five. May becomes might in the past. Shall becomes should. And will becomes would. And what's super weird about these L's in could, should, or would is listen to me saying them. You don't pronounce the L's, and this is the only place in English where that silent L shows up. It's so strange. Ah, I love it. These are the irregular verbs, and these in fact are the most irregular of the irregular. If you can master these, you will be a grammar champion. And I believe in you, because you can learn anything. David out.
