The number of 3 by 3 matrices A whose entries are either 0 or 1, and for which the system A times the vector, or we kind of call it the 3 by 1 matrix XYZ is equal to 1, 0, 0, has exactly two distinct solutions is. So let's think about this a little bit. Let me define, just so we make sure we understand what this is saying, let me define my vector A, or sorry, my matrix A, the 3 by 3 matrix as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, just all lowercase letters. These are the actual entries in the matrix, and if that's the case, then this equation would be this thing, this is A times XYZ, times XYZ being equal to 1, 0, 0. And if we were to multiply out this expression over here, or if we were to multiply out this equation, we would get A times X plus B times Y plus C times Z is equal to 1. And we could do that for each of these rows. This row vector dotted with this column vector is going to be equal to 0. This row vector dotted with this column vector is going to be equal to 0. And if that's very unfamiliar to you, you might want to watch the linear algebra playlist. We go into a lot of detail on multiplying matrices and vectors and solving equations of this variety. But if we were to multiply it out, we would get, so if we multiplied this part out, we would get A times X plus B times Y plus C times Z is equal to 1. We would get D times X plus E times Y plus F times Z is equal to 0. And we would get G times, so this right over here, we would get G times X plus H times Y plus I times Z is going to be equal to 0. Now, this is the exact same equation as this right here. I just expressed it as three equations with three unknowns. Or another way to think about it is any solution to these three equations would essentially represent a point in three dimensions that is common to these three planes. Each of these equations represent a plane. And here we just have to think about it. What are all of the possible solutions we could have? Now, there is a situation where there is a solution where these planes intersect in exactly one point. So you could have the blue plane. The blue plane might go like this. The blue plane might look like this. The orange plane maybe intersects like this. We could do that in orange. The orange plane might come out like this. So it will intersect like that. It will go below it like that. And then maybe the green plane intersects like this. It doesn't have to be, they don't have to go at right angles like this. But this is easier for me to draw. So then the green plane intersects like that. And they would all intersect at that point. And that point would represent the solution. So this is one possibility where you have one solution. So this is what the one solution, this would mean having one solution. Now, there's the other situation in which there's no solutions. There's the possibility that there's no solutions where they don't intersect in one point. And a pretty straightforward way to imagine that is kind of a triangle. So maybe this is, so let me draw it like this. This is the blue plane. This is the blue plane like this. And then the orange plane might come in like, let me draw it as best as I can. Might come out like this. Come out like that. Then go down, go under like that. And then the green plane might cut across like this. The green, try my best to draw it. The green plane might look like this. Where it cuts across, kind of like a teepee or a pyramid. Where the green plane intersects like that. So these three planes do not intersect in any one point. They each intersect with one other plane. Or they each intersect with the other two planes in an infinite number of points. But there's not one point in three dimensions that satisfies all three planes. This point right here satisfies the green and the blue plane, not the orange plane. Or the green and the blue equations, not the orange equation. This point right here satisfies the blue and the orange equation, not the green equation. This point over here satisfies the green and orange equations, but not the blue equation. So this right here, this is the case of no solutions. And then the final circumstance that you could have is an infinite number of solutions. And that especially, so you can imagine, these actually, well, they can't all three be the same equation because this one has a 1 here, but this one has 0s here. But these two could be the same equation. They could represent the same exact plane. So let's say they both represent this magenta plane over here. And then you have this blue thing over here, the blue plane. The blue plane may be coming out like this. The blue plane coming out like this, like that. They're kind of forming this x. And so you can imagine, in this situation, you have an infinite number of solutions. You have an infinite number. Any point here, any point at the intersection of these two planes would be a solution. So you would have an infinite, infinite number, infinite solutions. And that would even be the case if these were all 0s. If d, e, f, and g, h, and i were all 0s, then any x, y, and z would satisfy them. So it would really kind of reduce to kind of being all of r3. And so anything that satisfies the top equation would satisfy all 3. Because if you put these there, it would all be 0. So as you see, and maybe you already realized this before that, if you have three planes intersecting, you can either have one solution, no solutions, or an infinitely many solutions. Another way to have no solutions is if two of these planes are parallel. Or maybe these coefficients are 0, 0, and 0. 0x plus 0y plus 0z is equal to 1. Well, no x, y, and z is going to satisfy that. So that would be another no solutions case. But no matter what you do, you're either going to have one solution, no solutions, or infinite solutions. Now, this question is asking us, find the number of matrices A, the number of 3 by 3 matrices A, whose entries are either 0 or 1. So sure, all these coefficients are either 0 or 1. That has exactly two distinct solutions. Well, I just showed you. You either have one solution, no solutions, or infinite solutions. You cannot have exactly two distinct solutions. So the number of 3 by 3 matrices that has exactly two solutions to this equation is A big 0.
