We're asked to subtract negative two x squared plus four x minus one from six x squared plus three x minus nine. And like always, I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can give it a go. All right, now let's work through this together. So I could rewrite this as six x squared plus three x minus nine minus, minus this expression right over here. So I'll put that in parentheses, minus negative two x squared, negative two x squared, plus four x minus one. Now what can we do from here? Well, we can distribute this negative sign. We can distribute this negative sign. And then if we did that, we would get the six x squared plus three x minus nine won't change, so we still have that. Six x squared plus three x minus nine. But then if I distribute the negative sign, the negative of negative two x squared is positive two x squared. So that's going to be positive two, give it a little more space, positive two x squared. And then subtract, and then the negative of positive four x is, I'm going to subtract four x now. And then the negative of negative one, or the opposite of negative one, is gonna be positive one. So I've just distributed the negative sign. And now I can add terms that have the same degree, on our x, the same degree terms, I guess you could say. So I have an x squared term. Here it's six x squared. Here I have a two x squared term. So I can add those two together. Six x squared plus two x squared. If I have six x squareds, and then I have another two x squareds, how many x squareds am I now going to have? I'm now going to have eight x squareds. Eight x squareds. Or six x squared plus two x squared, we add the coefficients, the six and the two, to get eight, eight x squared. Then we can add the x terms. You could view these as the first degree terms. Three x, we have three x, and then we have minus four x. So three x minus four x, if I have three of something and I take away four of them, I'm now going to have negative one of that thing. Or you could say that the coefficients, three minus four would be negative one. So I now have negative one x. I could write it as negative one x, but I might as well just write it as negative x. That's the same thing as negative one x. And then finally I can deal with our constant terms. I have, I'm subtracting a nine, and then I'm adding a one. So you could say, well, what's a negative nine plus one? Well, that's going to be negative eight. That's going to be negative eight. And we are all done.
