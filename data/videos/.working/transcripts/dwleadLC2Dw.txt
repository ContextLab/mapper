Let's say I'm some type of an investment bank, and I go out there and I buy a whole bunch of mortgages. So right here are a whole bunch of people's mortgages. And when I say buy a mortgage, it means that the homeowners who borrowed the money, instead of the money going to the mortgage broker who the homeowner thinks that they got the loan from, or from the servicer who they think they're paying the check to, since I now have bought these mortgages, I've essentially become the lender to the homeowner. And so the homeowner's mortgage payments will now come to me, the investment bank. It will now come to me, the investment bank. So I do this for a bunch of homeowners right over there. But I don't want to be the end holder of the paper. I really want to be an intermediary. So what I do is I set up a special purpose entity. I set up a special purpose entity, which is really just a corporation that I set up. And I stick all of the mortgages inside of that special purpose entity. So I stick them all inside of that. So now the special purpose entity is the owner of the mortgages. And the investment bank, at least starting off, would own all of the shares of the special purpose entity. And so the investment bank could then sell shares. It could split the special purpose entity into a million or 10 million shares, and then sell those shares to investors. And these shares would be called mortgage-backed securities, or sometimes MBSs. They're a part of a general class called asset-backed securities. Because what's going to happen now is that all of this money flowing from homeowners will go to the mortgages, which are now owned by the special purpose entity. So they'll all end up inside of the special purpose entities. And some of them will default, some of them won't. But on average, the special purpose entity will then be able to pay a dividend, or essentially you can almost view it on interest, to the owner of the mortgage-backed security.
