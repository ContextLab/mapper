At Hogwarts, there are four houses, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The bar chart below shows the number of house points that each house received today. How many house points did Hufflepuff receive? So if we look at this bar chart, we can assume that this column right over here is Hufflepuff, because it's the only one that starts with an H. This will be Gryffindor. This is Ravenclaw, and this must be Slytherin. And so if we look at Hufflepuff's bar chart, it looks like they have three points scored today. So let's put three points. Let's try one more. So here they're seeing how many house points did Slytherin receive. So this is going to be Slytherin, and it looks like they received four points.
