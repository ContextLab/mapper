Since last September, Patricia has been working at the convenience store down the road. So we have to think about what they've underlined right over here. This has been working. Do we want to go with that? And the first choice is always exactly as they wrote it right over here. So they wrote has been working. They wrote has been working over there. So do we want to go with it as it's written, which is always going to be the first choice, or do we think one of these other choices is going to make more sense? So since last September, Patricia has been working at the convenience store down the road. Well, has been working actually looks pretty good. Looks pretty good because we're not talking about something that just happened in the past tense. So if this is last, this is a timeline right over here. And if this is last September, she starts working last September, but then she keeps working since then. So we want something that is both, that starts in the past, but then keeps going on through the future. And so that's what has been working does for us. Now let's think about the other choices and see why they don't quite do that. So if we used works, works as the present tense, that would mean that she's only doing it right now. It doesn't mean that she's been doing it starting at some period in the past and continuing to do it all the way through right now. So if we said since last September, Patricia works at the convenience store down the road, then we essentially have the verb tense wrong because this is starting in the past and continuing while this is just the present. Since last September, Patricia is working at the convenience store down the road. So once again, this one is talking about the present while we want something that goes, that starts in the past and then continues through the present. So this one is only the present. Since last September, Patricia will be working. Well, this is now occurring in the future. And that's not what since last September is trying to talk about. Since last September, we want to go the past into the present. So we'll throw out that. Will be working kind of implies that, well, we're really talking about the future. And since last September, Patricia worked. So this is strictly the past. It's not really talking about the past and continuing through the present. So since last September, Patricia worked. That's kind of like, hey, she had worked and maybe she's not working anymore. But we want to convey that she started working then and she's continuing to work. So has been working seems to make the most sense.
