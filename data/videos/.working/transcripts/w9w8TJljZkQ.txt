This is ConMigo, an AI-powered guide designed to help all students learn. ConMigo is not just for students, though. Teachers can use ConMigo too by toggling from student mode to teacher mode. Once in teacher mode, ConMigo transforms into the teaching assistant you've always wanted. ConMigo has many exciting features that support teachers, and this video will showcase ways teachers can use ConMigo to track their students' progress. This feature is called the class snapshot. Once the class snapshot feature is selected, ConMigo will ask you, which course do you want to use the class snapshot for? I'm going to select Algebra 1. Once that button is selected, ConMigo springs into action and tells me how my students have performed the last seven days in my course. ConMigo will show me their learning time. ConMigo will show me how they're performing on their assignments, how they're performing on their skills, and how they are performing towards their mastery goals. ConMigo also includes additional prompts to help guide me into diving into my students' data, such as which students should I celebrate for their work on their assignments, who needs a check-in about their skills progress for the week, give me a list of students who are above 25% on their mastery goal, and I think this one may be my favorite. Group my class by their recommendations. This feature really does help me when I want to do skill-based group instruction. When I select the who needs a check-in about their skills progress for the week, ConMigo creates a list of students that they think I should check on who may need a nudge in the course because they haven't been leveling up two skills per week. I'm able to see the list of students, and again ConMigo gives me a helpful link that I could click on that will give me direct access to the report that I need. After having my data chats with my students who are struggling, I can also use ConMigo to help me draft an email that I can send home to parents about their students' progress. Create a parent letter for Paul about his progress. And then I just let ConMigo do ConMigo's magic. This is wonderful. Thank you so much ConMigo. Oops, I totally forgot Paul's mom speaks Spanish. Could you please translate this to Spanish? Again, one click of the button and my email is ready to go to Paul's mom. This is an amazing feature. Thank you so much ConMigo. I appreciate all of your help. You have saved me so much time. Thanks so much for watching and be on the lookout for more videos to come on how to use ConMigo to support your students.
