What can we do to improve K-12 education in America the best? Well today, if you're motivated to learn, if you really, really, really want to learn, this is an amazing time for everyone because if you have access to Wikipedia, if you have access to the latest information on the web, there's a website that I've just been using with my kids recently called Khan Academy, K-H-A-N, just one guy doing some unbelievable 15-minute tutorials. There's great college lectures out on academicearth.org. So if you're motivated, now you can go to the very best lectures. Speaking of allocation of society's resources, I think you said on your campus tour, at least at Harvard, that the allocation of IQ points of our society to Wall Street financial instruments was higher than it needed to be and that some of those IQ points should go into other fields. Yeah, well, if you say, okay, what portion of society's IQ goes into studying great teachers and documenting what those great teachers do and how you would spread those practices, what is effectively the R&D component in education? It's about as close to nil as you can imagine. And yet, what's the most important thing in terms of having a society that has both got a quality of opportunity and is competitive with other countries? It's education. And so it's this mind-blowing misallocation. You know, my favorite vignette is that guy, Salman Khan, he was a hedge fund guy making lots of money and he quit to do these little web videos. And so we have moved, I'd say, about 160 IQ points from the hedge fund category into the teaching many, many people in the leveraged way category. So, you know, that was a good day, the day that his wife let him quit his job. Now, we need something like that, you know, in a very broad and dramatic way.
