I thought it would be interesting to get a little bit more intuition on ellipses and their foci, or foci, sometimes I like to call them focuses, but the correct word is foci or foci, but either pronunciation is apparently okay. So let's work with this. This is an interactive exercise on Khan Academy as you see over here. So let's see if we can work through this together and learn a little bit more about ellipses. So they tell us the equation of an ellipse is X minus X1 squared over A squared plus Y minus 1 squared over B squared equals 1. And this is true. This is the equation of an ellipse. This would be an ellipse that is centered at X equals X1, Y equals Y1. The major radius would be A. The minor radius would be B. So then they say find the foci of the ellipse below by moving the orange points to their correct positions. Then use that information to find the values of X1, Y1, A, and B. So they want us to move these to their correct position. And the correct position is where the sum of the distance, so if we move it to the correct position, the sum of the length of that red line and the length of that green line should be constant. Now you can see they're clearly not in the correct position right over here because up here when I was moving it around, you see that look, the distance to focus 1 from this point on the ellipse is 11.7. That's the green line. The distance to focus 2 is 6. You add them together is 17.8. But when you move it around, that changes. And so we would have to find a different, we could just keep trying in different foci until that sum of these, the red length and the green length is constant. Now in my mind, that is a hard way to do it. An easier way to do it would be, well let's figure out the center of the ellipse first, which we could do just literally by inspecting this drawing, and then figure out what the length of the major radius and the minor radius is, and then use that information to find the foci. So let's see if I can put these dots. Let me put them first at the center. All right, so let's see. So that center, and let me, that looks pretty good. That looks like the center. And I can even confirm. So in the y direction, that is if I'm at the top of the ellipse, I am 10 from that center. And if I'm at the bottom of the ellipse, I am 10 from that center. And so that does look like the center. And it also tells us that the major radius is 10. And it's along the y-axis. So the major radius is 10, and it's along the y-axis. And we also know the y-coordinate of the center. It's y is equal to 4. And then the x-coordinate of the center is x equals 5. So once again, where I put this orange dot, that is the center of the ellipse. It says x equals 5, y equals 4. And that's why I put x equals 5, or x1 equals 5, y1 equals 4. And you see from the equation of ellipse, that's what defines the center of the ellipse. And then a is going to be, a, we can see from here, this is the radius in the x direction. I guess you want me to think about it. And that's going to be the minor radius. It's a shorter radius. And you see that has length 8. We're going from x equals 5 to x equals 13. Or x equals negative 3 to x equals 5. So it has length 8. So this thing right over here, a is going to be 8. So this is 8. And we already said the major radius is going to be in the vertical direction. And it is of length 10. So just like that, we figured out we could write the equation down. I don't have my pen out. But you could just say, the equation of this ellipse is going to be x minus 5 squared over 8 squared plus y minus 4 over 10 squared equals 1. But now let's actually figure out where we need to put these foci. And then figure out that, hey, look, if we put them in the right place, the sum of the red and green lines is going to be a constant. And clearly where they are right now, it's not a constant. You see that sum of the distances is at 20.6. And then it goes to 20. It's clearly not constant. So let's see if we can do it. And one way to do it is just to remember, well, there's a formula. And we talk about it. We explore the intuition behind it in a previous video. But the formula for the foci ellipse is you find the difference between the larger of these two values and the smaller of these two values. So in this case, you would find the difference between 10 squared and 8 squared. Well, that's going to be 100 minus 64, which is 36. And then you take the square root of that. So it's going to be equal to 6. So the focal length is going to be equal to 6. So if we go back to the center, if we had figured out our focal length is 6. And again, remember, all I did is I took the larger of these, I squared it. And from that, I subtracted the other one squared. So 100 squared minus 8 squared is 100 minus 64, which is 36. And I took the square root of that to get 6. So our focal length along the major axis, I could say, is going to be 6. So it's going to be 6 from the center up and 6 from the center down. So 6 from the center up, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And 6 from the center down, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now that's what the math tells us. But let's just make sure that this actually holds. So now let's go to points on the ellipse. And you see, it's calculating the distance to each of the foci. And those lines, or the length of the lines, or the distances. And you see when you sum them up, we are at a nice constant 20, which is the really cool thing about ellipses. That look, I could go anywhere around here. And the sum of these two distances of the green and the red line, their lengths, is a constant 20. That's actually what defines an ellipse. In fact, you can draw an ellipse on a chalkboard. If you have a string of, say, length 20 centimeters, and you put one focus there and one focus there, and you kind of put your chalk in the string, and you just tried to move it around, and so it would look something like that. Anyway, hopefully you found that as fun as I did.
