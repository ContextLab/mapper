Here again with famous author Jeffrey Moore and what are we doing last time we were talking about this Gerald Conti's letter We were and and this is part of a process in the invention We call read and react where a lot of academics as you read somebody else's ideas And then you react to them and you write an essay based on your reactions So we spent a bunch of time you're my guinea pig here and I appreciate you being the guinea pig So we spent some time Building up some ideas that you were having in reaction to the letter and I they're summarized here on the page I'd love for you to just sort of read them out and we at the bottom half We kind of formalized it and then we're going to talk today about well, where do you go from here? This is very nice. Everyone should have a Jeffrey Moore to make a synopsis of their thoughts Which I believe is which I believe is the function of the Khan Academy All right. So this is so these are some of the notes that you got from what I had said in the last video Micro-managing and standardized testing can strangle the creativity of the great teacher. Yes, I did say that in the last video Did you still believe that I thought about a little bit more. I definitely I definitely believe that Micro-managing strangles the creativity of a great teacher, you know, if they tell you day by day what to do Your your individual unit tests and homeworks are dictated by someone else. I think that definitely Hurts that the standardized testing I've thought about it a little bit more I mean most of the standardized tests that I've seen especially at the state level the ones that you know to measure whether students are At grade level or what or not, whatever else They are kind of a minimum bar You know, it's not always obvious because the results aren't always great But if you look at them, they are a minimum bar and I think most great teachers will look at those as minimum bars And so I don't know if it necessarily, you know You If great learning is happening The kids are gonna learn a hundred different things and they should also be able to meet meet the five things that get them Past that that that the minimal bar. So I don't know whether the standardized testing by itself Strangles strangles the creativity I think the place where where that could be the case is a situation where you have a great teacher in a tough environment where the kids are Well behind grade level and just then that minimum bar is no longer a minimum bar anymore It could be a very difficult bar. And so what does that teacher do? In fact, you're gonna get to that. I think it was okay. Okay. Yeah So let's look at the other ones whenever the public be that a governor or politician or superintendent gets worried about the education system The reaction is to place more constraints on it and make it more rigid. This is I still believe this This other way that is a very cool point. I'd never thought about that. That's a really cool idea This might de-risk some of the worst classroom some of the ones that are really failing where students are not getting even to a minimal Level but it has a horrible consequence of suppressing the very best teachers. I still believe this I mean this all goes back to okay, you're worried you're micromanaging micromanaging is bad It's kind of a march to mediocrity. I agree with that if you if you tell the best teachers what to do hour by hour They're not going to be the best teacher The solution that they are placing on teachers like Gerald Conti is not the correct one I believe that there are solutions that can bring up the standards of the worst performing schools Without necessarily holding back the Gerald Conti's of the world. I still think that although I think it's it's you know It's not an easy a Challenge I think it would be more of their experiments that need to be tried to see if we can if we can do this And then let's see you wrote top-down state-mandated curricula that have been have to be followed to a T While they might help de-risk some of the worst performing classrooms have the negative impact of holding back the very best And this is I did say that I think this was this was the thesis sentence We constructed what we were trying to say if you had to just put it all into one sentence So I guess my question would be here you've had a week to think about this How do you feel about this as this is everything? I'm gonna say is somewhere represented in this sentence. I Agree, I definitely agree with the top-down state-mandated Curricula because this is much more about micromanaging then I mean you you you could have standardized testing without a top-down State-mandated curricula you could tell a teacher look you do whatever you see is fit you use whatever textbooks you want you you do whatever activities You want but at the end of the year we're gonna just do a test and just make sure your kids are at some minimal bar I don't think that is is what I'm necessarily against It's the do this week by week or do this hour by hour and you have to use this textbook You have to use this test you have to use these problem sets So this is what I guess you wrote a synopsis of what I I said I'll write a little bit about the motivations of administrators and officials why they're even thinking along these lines That's all about the test scores and the number of kids that have to take remedial math But then I would really focus in on how state mandates have to be followed to the letter While they might help a classroom that is really broken are definitely going to hold back more successful Performing classrooms and then I would write about alternate solutions that might be able to address the broken classrooms without breaking the non-broken ones Yeah, I think this is I still feel this way. Okay, cool So now so now we've got some invention that we think is pretty interesting and we're gonna apply some organizational exercises to it now Sound I've had a conversation offline. This isn't exactly the way he writes but I again, he's agreeing to play guinea pig with me to sort of walk through this system because I think in my experience in teaching freshman English This is a way in which a lot of people have been able to come to terms with writing Maybe they're not quite as gifted at it as some others. This is kind of fun so what we're gonna do is let's let's double-click on any one of these ideas in red either in the Thesis sentence or in this paragraph below it and we'll just start developing that one. Okay. Well, I guess I mean we'll start with a thesis sentence So the first claim We have two claims here if you'll notice one is These curricula might help de-risk some of the worst performing classroom. So let's take that one. So that is now a sub claim It's not a thesis sentence But it's gonna become a topic sense meaning it's part of the thesis that we're gonna develop in a paragraph so the topic sentence might say It's something like it is, you know state-mandated curricula might help de-risk some of the worst performing classrooms So that's a claim. Mm-hmm, right? Do you have any evidence for that claim? Why do you believe that? Well, I don't have evidence. I guess, you know that would hold up in a court of law type of evidence but you know if I were to kind of imagine in my head a classroom where maybe the lectures that are being given aren't completely accurate or They're not able to cover all of the material in the class or Maybe has not absolutely nothing to do with the teacher Maybe it's a the students are acting up and it's disrupting some of the other students in the classroom There there I could see look if you have some if you have some well, actually I would take that back I mean we're talking about state state state mandated Curricula Yeah, I mean the issue is that you are essentially trying to solve for if there's a if there's a teacher that has bad judgment And is you know, even though this is math class They have the the students finger painting the whole time because they just think that will help their you know, eventually help their mathematics Then telling that teacher. No, look you've got to use this textbook on on October 5th the students have to take this test. It's gonna have these questions in it then on October 18th You're gonna have to make them do this that could help de-risk that I obviously talking about an extreme circumstance No, what you did was interesting So the claim the claim and we were looking at an extreme circumstance because this is not the core of our thesis We're actually just trying to say the opposite of our thesis has some validity and we're trying to just export briefly But you didn't have so we didn't have any data for that Now by the way, one of the wonderful things about the web these days is we probably could go on the web or find data And I think by the way in college you're increasingly expected to do that But for the moment during this talk, we're not gonna do that actually I was interested I mean, so if I wanted to collect data, I would probably do a search for something like testing or not testing state curricula improving test scores or Improving outcomes and I probably could find some state results that are doing I think I think we both We're both very confident that that kind of stuff would happen. So when you're writing an essay, I make a claim I might so two paths one path is I'll go to the web I'll enter something a search argument and I will get some evidence for that claim Increasingly that is the standard expected in a college essay But if you're writing the essay say on an exam, you're in the middle of an exam, you can't do that Right. So and sometimes it's not it's not as big enough point to do it So then you give examples and it was interesting to watch you construct your example because you ended up saying well If there's there's problems in accuracy in the teachers Presentation of the material if there's problems with coverage They're not getting it covered and then you went into the students acting up you thought no that way that's not that's not part of the deal So you took that one off and they said they have the bad judgment to not do things Those are all examples of when the claim would be true And so and so all you're doing is you're giving your we call it backing up the claim Now let's back up a claim that you care more about so so I'm not sure whether that's the alternate solutions or the hold back more successful classrooms. I Actually don't believe you. Oh, yeah micro micromanaging. Let's just do that Micromanaging would hold back more successfully performing classrooms. So that's another topic sentence for another paragraph. So Do you believe that and if and why do you believe that? I absolutely believe that I mean that's you know That's the teacher who's gone out and written their own exam that tests much deeper conceptual Understanding than the one that comes from the publishing company the teacher that has their students Constructing proofs of Things or exploring math at a much deeper level than that is expected by the state tests That teacher to tell them no, no, no, you have to use a publisher's test You have to do, you know You have to make these kids do 200 problems of busy work as opposed to having these students try to do something creative or inventive That's unfortunate. That's that's holding back everyone's experience. Okay, so again What if you if you were listening to this and what we're gonna kind of wrap this up with an idea here in just a second Sal gave three different examples of How a micromanaged approach to testing would hold back a creative teacher And so again in the paragraph he was supporting this He would be saying he'd state his claim and then he'd give those examples right one after another in sentence It's just the way he did in conversation and that would make start to make up and organize the body of a paragraph Now I want to close this with a with a model I want you to do a little drawing for me if you will And this model is called the Tillman model and you can look it up on the web to you lmin Tillman was a lawyer teaching other lawyers how to how to make arguments and he's got a rather it's a complex It's a complex model. We're gonna look at it in another in another video in detail but I just want to give you the the simplified version of it and it's basically just a line where you put claim on the right and you put evidence on the left and The idea is whenever you make a claim you've got to link it to some evidence Sometimes the evidence is data. Sometimes the evidence is examples So in a more scientific paper, you'd actually refer to test data But in a more humanities oriented paper, you'd probably refer to examples Although you might refer back to a line in a poem like Ozymandias Okay, the data and examples and then the third part of the model. It's a little bar that goes down in the middle He called the warrant which is kind of a Abstract term but it's anything you would say to connect the if the evidence the connection between the evidence and the claim isn't obvious You have to put an extra sentence in there saying and here's why the evidence warrants me making this claim And you read or believing in this claim And so that's so we use that model in the next in the next video we'll talk a little bit more about how you can use this model and a more complete version of this model to help structure Paragraphs, it's a kind of get a big picture. What's been going on here because that's as you're guinea pig I want to understand what's happening You and I read the last I read you know This this thing down here in the last video you had me react to it essentially And then you recorded as what I was reacting to and then through that you were able to mine out my claims And then the whole point of this one is we picked a couple of claims and you had essentially me go through the exercise of coming Up with the evidence and maybe the warrants to for a few of them We didn't do all of them, but maybe now we're ready to start Exactly, and this is part of the transition in our chevron model We had one that said assess the writing situation then do invention then do organizing This is the transition from invention to organizing eyes, so we're beginning to organize our thoughts
