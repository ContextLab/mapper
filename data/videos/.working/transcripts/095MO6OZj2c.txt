We're told there are 18 students in a school choir. They need to stand in three equal rows for their performance. How many students will there be in each row? Pause this video and try to do this yourself before we do this together. All right, now let's do this together. What I'm going to do is first I'm going to set up the rows and then I'm gonna one by one put these 18 students into the rows and see how many end up in each row. So let's call, let me make three lines here for the three rows. So there and there. So this is row one, this is row two, this is row three. And I'm just going to use a circle to represent each of the students in the choir. So I'm going to put the first student in row one, the second student in row two, the third student in row three. And so I'm just gonna keep doing that, doing one at a time into each row. So one, two, three, I'm gonna count all the way to 18. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. All right, it looks like I got the exact same number of circles or students in each of these three rows. How many are there? It looks like one, two, three, four, five, six in each of these rows. There's six here, six here and six here. And that makes sense because if I add six plus six plus six, I get to 18. If I say six times three, that's 18. Or if I say I have 18 students and I wanna divide them into three equal rows, that is going to be equal to six.
