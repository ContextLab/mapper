So what we're going to do in this video is try to figure out what 312 times 23 is. And we're going to do it two different ways simultaneously to realize that they're really just doing the same thing. So the first way that we're going to do it, I would call that the standard way. Some people would call it the standard algorithm. So let's do it here, 312 times 23. So that's what we're going to do here on the left. And then here on the right, we're going to do what's known as partial products. And actually, we're going to do a few partial products even in the standard way. But over here, let me just write it, 312 times 23. Now either technique, what we're going to think about is breaking up these numbers and multiplying each of the components times each other. So in the standard algorithm or the standard way, you start with the ones place over here and you could first multiply it times the one place above. So three times two is six. Then you can multiply three times this one. It's really three times 10. So you get 30. And then you get three and then you can multiply three times this 300, which would be 900. So three times 312 is 936. Now in the partial products world, we just break that up. First we say, what is three times two? Well, that is going to be six. What is three times 10? Well that is going to be 30. And what is three times 300? Well that is going to be 9, 900. So notice here I just added up the 930 and six altogether to get 936 when I'm doing it the standard way. And with the partial products, I've just kept them separate. Three times two, three times 10, three times 300. Now if we do it the standard way, we would go to the tens place on this bottom number, this 20. Now since we're dealing with the tens place, that's why we put this zero here while we're doing this standard way of doing it. And we say, okay, what's two times two? We would get four. Now notice when I write it down, it's actually 40 and that makes sense because I really did 20 times two, which is 40. Then I could say, what is two times one? Well that is just two. But notice this two is in the hundreds place and that makes sense because 20 times 10 is 200. And then last but not least, if I multiply the 20 times the 30, I could say that that is going to be 6,000. You might just say two times three, but it's really 20 times 30, which is why the six is in the thousands place. Now if I were to do it with the partial products technique, I would say 20 times two is 40. I would say 20 times 10 is 200. And I would say 20 times three is 6,000. So once again, I've just broken it all up. I have more partial products. While here I only have two partial products is one way to think about it. But then in either case, I just want to add up all the partial products. On the standard technique, six plus zero is six, three plus four is seven, nine plus two is 11. I regroup one of those ones. One plus seven is six. I get 7,176. Here I do the same thing. Look at the ones place. I got a little bit uneven, so I'm going to make these lines to just make sure I add up the right places. So I get a six here, six plus zero plus zero plus a bunch of zeros. Then I have three plus four. I get a seven here. Then I have nine plus two. I have a one regroup of one. One plus six is seven, 7,176. And either way, in the partial products, I guess it's the pure. Your partial products, I break up everything. I get six different partial products here while in the standard algorithm or the standard technique, I essentially take the partial products of three times 312 and 20 times 312. So I only have two partial products. But hopefully you see that these are very similar techniques.
