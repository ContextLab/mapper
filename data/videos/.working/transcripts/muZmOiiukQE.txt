Let's get some practice interpreting graphs of proportional relationships. So it says the proportional relationship between the distance driven and the amount of time driving is shown in the following graph. So we have the distance driven on the vertical axis, it's measured in kilometers, and then we have the time driving and it's measured in hours along the horizontal axis. And we can tell just visually that this indeed is a proportional relationship. How do we know that? Well, the point zero zero is on this graph. The graph goes through the origin. If we have zero time, then we have zero distance. And we can also see that it's a line, that it's a linear relationship. If you have a linear relationship that goes through the origin, you're dealing with a proportional relationship. You could also see that by taking out some points here. So, let's see, I'm just eyeballing it. So I'm gonna look at, where does the graph kind of hit a very well defined point? So actually at point A right over here, we see that when our time is five hours, our distance traveled is, or distance driven is, what is this, it's 400 kilometers. 400 kilometers. And then if we look at time, we see at this point right over here, when our time is two and a half, when our time is two and a half, we see that our distance driven is 200 kilometers. And notice, the ratio between these variables and any one of these points is the same. 400 divided by five is 80. And 200 divided by 2.5 is also going to be 80. Or if you wanna go the other way around, you have to go from time to distance. We're multiplying by, we're multiplying, we're always multiplying by 80. In fact, we could say that distance divided by time, our proportionality constant is going to be 80. Or if we wanted to include the units there, it might be a little more obvious that we're dealing with the rate. Distance is in kilometers, time is in hours, 80 kilometers per hour. This is the rate at which we are driving. We are going at this speed, 80 kilometers per hour. This is also the proportionality constant. Well anyway, with all of that out of the way, let's actually answer the questions. Which statements about the graph are true? Select all that apply. The vertical coordinate of point A represents the distance driven in four hours. The vertical coordinate, the vertical coordinate. So point A is at the coordinate five comma 400. Now the vertical coordinate tells us how high to go up, how far to move in the vertical direction. That's going to be the second coordinate right over here. So this is the vertical coordinate. So this right over here tells us the distance we've driven in four hours. So yes, the vertical coordinate of point A represents the distance driven in four hours. We've driven 400 kilometers. So I like that one, I'll check that one. The distance driven in one hour is 80 kilometers. The distance driven in one hour is 80 kilometers. Well, when you just try to eyeball it off of the graph here, see after one hour, it looks like it's a little bit more than 75. So yeah, 80 seems like a reasonable one. But we see it even more clearly when we look at the calculation that we did. If you take a distance, if you take a distance, any one of these distance, 400 kilometers, 400 kilometers over five hours, tells you that your rate is 80 kilometers per hour. And you know this is going to happen for any point on this line. They tell us it's a proportional relationship and we can tell visually it's a proportional relationship. It goes to the origin and it is a line. So the distance traveled in one hour is going to be 80 kilometers. It is going to be 80 kilometers because we're going 80 kilometers per hour. So in one hour, we're going to go 80 kilometers. So I like that choice as well. Of course, I won't pick none of the above because I found two choices that I liked. Let's do another one of these. This is fun. A grocery store sells cashews. The relationship between weight and cost of cashews is shown in the following graph. And once again, we see it as a proportional relationship. It goes to the origin and it is a line. Which statements about the graph are true? Select all that apply. The point zero zero shows the cost is zero dollars for zero kilograms of cashews. Yeah, zero kilograms of cashews, it's zero dollars. Yep, that makes sense. The point two comma 60, that's this point right over here, shows the cost is two dollars for 60 kilograms of cashews. The cost is two dollars for 60 kilograms of cashews. No, this is showing us that the cost is 60 dollars. The cost is 60 dollars for two kilograms for two kilograms of cashews. This axis right over here, this is weight. Actually, if you're measuring kilograms, you're really talking about mass. But anyway, I don't want to get too particular here. But this, you have a mass here of two kilograms. So the, I guess you could say the horizontal coordinate tells you the mass, the vertical coordinate tells you the cost. And that is 60, 60 dollars. So it's 60 dollars for two kilograms, not two dollars for 60 kilograms. That would be a deal. If you could get, this is kind of what a medium sized grown man would weigh 60 kilograms. And for two dollars for that much cashews, that would be an incredible deal. So you definitely want to rule that one out. And I'm not going to pick none of the above because I already figured out that I liked the first choice up there. Let's just do one more, just for good measure. An employee earns an hourly wage, shown in the graph below. Find the hourly wage. So we see here in the horizontal axis, we have hours worked. And in the vertical axis, earnings. We see it's a proportional relationship. That the, and that makes sense. The ratio between earnings and hours should always be constant. If we're earning money at a constant rate, we see it visually, we go through the origin, and we're dealing with a line. So there's a bunch of ways that we could look at it. We could say, we could say hours. So let's see, hours, hours, and then dollars. After one hour, we've made $40. And just the fact visually that we know it's a proportional relationship says, hey, we're making $40 per hour. 40, if we take dollars divided by hours, I'll write it out in the units. $40 divided by one hour. This right over here is $40 per hour. You could view this as our proportionality constant, or you could use the rate at which we're earning money. $40 per hour, and you see that. Two hours, $80. Two hours, $80. 80 divided by two is 40. Three hours, $120. Three hours, $120. 120 divided by three is 40. Our proportionality constant is 40. That your earnings, your earnings, earnings divided by hours, hours is always going to be equal to 40. Or you could say that your earnings, your earnings is equal to, if you multiply both sides by hours, is going to be equal to 40 times your hours. Your earnings in dollars is going to be equal to 40 times your hours.
