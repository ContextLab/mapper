I met Sam when he was a 10th grader at Grace King High School. He was in my Algebra II class. There was a kid who challenged me. He was a natural leader as far as getting other kids involved and active. Oh man! What are you, you're teaching AP Calculus now? Really? Awesome! Oh man, I would have brought you on stage! No, seriously, I didn't know you were here! This guy, he wrote my recommendations for Calc- Honestly, none of this would have happened. I'm not new. I don't know what to do. I feel like crying anyway. This guy really hasn't changed one bit. He's still the same Salman Khan that I saw in high school. Down to earth, easygoing, accessible. Nothing pretentious about him. And that's one of the things that really makes Calc Academy what it is. It's like the whole thing is like the gift that kids don't give. I think what education is about.
