So losing your job is often one of the more stressful things that anyone has to deal with in their life. One, we all wanna find purpose in life and find where we fit in, but oftentimes even more importantly, that loss of income can be a big deal for you and those who are dependent on you. So what do you think about in that circumstance? So depending on the state you're living in, I'm assuming that we're talking in a United States context, you may have access to unemployment insurance. You will typically qualify if you lost your job for no major fault of your own. What do I mean by major fault? You could still qualify for unemployment insurance if you even underperformed, and so it was a performance thing, as long as you didn't do some kind of misconduct or you got fired for doing something really, really bad, you might qualify. And definitely if you just got laid off because your employer had to do some cost cutting or they removed some roles, you're likely to qualify for unemployment insurance in your state. Now the benefits that you get are going to vary from state to state. Most states, the benefit is about three to $600 a week and they don't last forever. Some states like Massachusetts, depending on what your income was before you lost your job and how many dependents you have, it can actually get close to $1,000 or even get a little bit above $1,000. But the amount of benefit you get is based on the income that you had before. It is definitely not your full income, but it's based on that and then it caps out after a certain point. And it's not forever. As I was touching on, some states are closer to about 12 weeks, so give or take three months or so, and some states are closer to 26 weeks, closer to about six months or so. And even while you're in that time period, they expect you to be looking for a job and they will check in on you to make sure that you are looking for a job because this isn't meant to be something forever. This is meant to hold you and your family over while you are hopefully able to transition into your next job. Now, there's other things that you might wanna look at depending on why you lost your job. Sometimes you might lose your job because you're not able to work anymore. Maybe you had an injury that's oftentimes referred to as disability that keeps you from working. If it's a short-term thing where you have to go through surgery and you have to be out of work for a month, that would be short-term disability. And there's oftentimes short-term disability insurance that either you might pay out of pocket or that your employer will cover. If it's long-term, then you're talking about long-term disability insurance. That would be something that's over years or maybe for the rest of your work life. You just can't work anymore, and that's to cover that. And if you've been paying into Social Security and the benefits vary on how much you've been paying into Social Security and how long you've been paying into Social Security, there's also Social Security Disability Insurance, SSDI. That is another option. Now, it's very important to keep in mind. None of these are likely to make you as whole as you were when you had your full income, but they're intended to help you when you're in some of these circumstances. Now, I would say the last thing to consider, but another important thing to consider, because here in the United States, for most people or for many people, your health insurance is tied to your work. And if you lose your work, what happens to your health insurance, which could be very important for you and your family? Well, one option is if you have a partner, if your spouse has an employer and they cover the family, that could be a good option. That's probably the first thing to look at. There's another program called COBRA. The acronym is kind of a, let me see, I have it written over here, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. You can just remember COBRA. But that essentially gives you the right to continue your employer insurance for another 18 months, but if there's a catch, you don't get it for free. You have to pay the full price for that insurance plus a, I think it's a 2%, a 2% fee. So you're going to have to be paying out of pocket, which is also hard, because you just lost your income. You might get some of that unemployment insurance, et cetera. But that's to at least make sure that you and your family can continue to be insured. Now, if your income drops below a certain threshold, then you might qualify for Medicaid. If you are ready to retire, then, you know, and if you're the right age, maybe even Medicare could come into play. And then last but not least, because of the Affordable Care Act, there are subsidized plans on healthcare.gov that you can look at, that you could pay out of pocket, likely cheaper than your employer COBRA plan that you would have otherwise paid. But they all have trade-offs depending on the deductibles and what they might cover. So it's a tough situation that frankly, though, most people do go through at least once in their life. So it's good to keep track of how you hold yourself over. In general, you know, my take on it is, it's great that there are some of these programs, but the best thing that you can have is, you know, have a nest tag, control as much of your destiny as you can. You can't always, none of us can control all of it. So, you know, try to save up that rainy day funds that you can't have, that's what this is for, or one of the things that this is for. But above and beyond that, there are definitely government programs and things that you might do, forms of insurance that your employer might do, to make sure that you and your family are at least in reasonable shape if you find yourself in this situation.
