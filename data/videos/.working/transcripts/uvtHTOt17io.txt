We're told the time and hours that three students spent on a project are represented below. Each large square represents one hour. Order the students by the time spent on the project from least to greatest. So pause this video and have a go at that before we do this together. All right, now let's do this together. So let's see who did the least. And this first block here, you could view that, well, actually when we just visually look at it, we can immediately see that Ara and Vera did a whole hour and then they did a little bit more, while Liam didn't even quite do a whole hour. If we were to write the amount of time that Liam spent, it looks like this whole is divided into tenths. There's 10 equal rectangles and nine of them are filled in. So this is nine tenths, whoops, you can't see that. This is nine tenths of an hour, which is equal to, we could write it this way, 0.99 tenths. So the least is Liam, because we're trying to go from least to greatest, so we've used Liam already. So now let's compare Ara or Ara and Vera. They both did a whole and then then some, so let's compare the then some. Ara did one and then how many hours? So it might be a little hard to see, but this is divided into tenths. There's 10 equal rectangles here. And if I look carefully, it looks like five of those 10 are colored in. So this is one and five tenths of an hour, or hours I should say, which is the same thing as 1.5. Well if I look at Vera, it looks like we definitely have that one, we have that whole, and then here, looks like we have 10 hundredths completely filled in, 20 hundredths completely filled in, 30 hundredths, 40 hundredths, and then five more. So it looks like one and 45 over 100, which is the same thing as one and 45 and hundredths, or one and four tenths and five hundredths. So if we were to compare it between Vera and Ara, if we could just go to the tenths, Vera didn't get to five tenths. She's a little bit below five tenths. She's at four tenths and then some. So Vera is the next smallest, so I will write Vera here, or I could say, I was also the next larger one than Liam, and then the person who spent the most time studying, or on the project, that's what we're measuring, spent the most time on the project, is Ara an hour and a half, and we're done, we've used all of them.
