I want to review a little bit of what we did in the last video and maybe draw a larger, more spread out diagram. Because I think in the last video, I started to cram things on the right hand side here. And this is a very important concept. So I want to do it nice and spread out in a way that we can breathe. And maybe in the process, I can fill in some more blanks. So let's go back and draw the membrane of a thylakoid that's sitting inside of a chloroplast. I'm going to draw the same membrane here. So let me draw it nice and spread out. So let me draw a nice big membrane like that. And that's the inside of the membrane. So you can imagine that this loops around and that would form the thylakoid. On this side of the membrane, we have the lumen. And on the outside of the membrane, we have the stroma, all the fluid that fills up the chloroplast. So this is the stroma right there. And this is just kind of a standard membrane that we see in a lot of organelles. But this is actually a membrane within an organelle. And it'll be a phospho-bi-lipid layer. And I just say that, or I'm pointing that out, because I want to think a little bit about in this video how protons can actually get across this thing. How do we use the energy from these electrons going to lower energy states to actually pump protons across this membrane? So when you have these bi-lipid layers, your outside is hydrophilic. And of course, it's hydrophilic because it operates well in a polar environment. And then the insides are non-polar or they're hydrophobic and you have these tails. So I could draw the whole membrane like that, but I won't do that, it'll take me forever. But let me draw some of the components that I did in the last video. So we have these complexes that span across this membrane. And the place that we started off with was the photosystem II complex. And then later on, we have the photosystem I complex. And let me draw the ATP synthase right here. So ATP synthase also spans across it, then it has this little motor part of it. And the hydrogens go through and spins the motor and it crams the phosphate groups into the ADP to make ATP. But the first thing I want to point out is, as I said in the last video, the first place where the electrons get excited is in the chlorophyll and photosystem II. And then it gets less and less and less excited, it gets handed off from one complex to another complex and eventually ends up in photosystem I. It gets excited again, then it gets handed off, handed off the whole time that energy is being used to transfer hydrogen protons from the stroma into the lumen. But the first question that I would ask is, why is this called photosystem II? Well, this is called photosystem I, where we're starting over here. And the reason is, this was discovered first. Even though in the light reactions, it actually comes into use or it comes into play second. This was discovered first. So that's why they call it photosystem I. But the reality is, photosystem II is where everything starts from. Now, in some textbooks, you'll also see this written as P680. And you'll see photosystem I written as P700. And these numbers come from the wavelength of light that is best absorbed by the chlorophyll in these photosystems. So 680 corresponds to 680 nanometers. That's the wavelength of light that this absorbs the best. 700 corresponds to 700 nanometers. That's the wavelength of light it absorbs best. Now, what I want to do here is draw a little diagram below here to kind of talk more about the electron energy states. I just kind of hand-waved it a little bit in the last video. So I'm going to draw a little diagram here. And over here, I'm going to write the different things that the electron can be a part of. So right now, let's say the electron can be part of H2O. It could be a part of chlorophyll A. It could be a part of, I'll talk more about this in a little bit, pheophytin. And then you have all the molecules or the complexes it can become a part of. I'll actually write them down here. So let me write, I don't want to take up too much space, plastoquinone. And then there's a cytochrome B6F complex. I'll just write B6F. Then you have plastocyanin. I'll just write this PC. You don't have to memorize these unless you'll forget them in a week if you do. But unless you're studying photosynthesis, then it might make sense to memorize them. And this is in photosystem II. Then you have chlorophyll in photosystem I. Chlorophyll in photosystem I. And then you have some other, you have ferredoxin. I'll just write FD for ferredoxin. Some other molecules you keep going. And then you have your eventual electron acceptor NADP plus, which once it accepts the electron becomes NADPH. Now electrons are very, so this is if we go up, that's a high energy state, down is a low energy state. So electrons are already very comfortable in water. And chlorophyll A, they're even more comfortable. At least this is how I view it. They're even more comfortable. But so left to its own devices, this electron will never leave chlorophyll A. But we know what happens. A photon comes in from 93 million miles away. You can imagine photons as little light packets, or you could use a light wave either way. And it excites not necessarily directly the chlorophyll A. It might excite other antenna chlorophyll or other pigment molecules. And then through resonance energy, you can imagine them vibrating, and it eventually will excite the chlorophyll A directly, or excite the electrons in chlorophyll A directly. And this dude right here gets excited. So it goes, let me do that in a brighter color. So it goes to a high energy state. So the electron here is in a high energy state. Ignore that lumen right there. It has nothing to do with this electron. And then it goes, and actually when it goes to the high energy state, maybe I should draw it like this. It actually shows up in pheophytin. That is the primary electron acceptor. And it's actually a chlorophyll A molecule. And actually, let me show you what a chlorophyll A molecule looks like. This is what a chlorophyll A molecule looks like. And in general, it has a hydrocarbon tail. You see that right here. Hydrocarbon tail. And it has a porphyrin ring, or porphyrin head, I guess you could call it. Porphyrin head. This little group right here is called a porphyrin. Porphyrin head. And right in the center of it, you have a magnesium, that green right there. That's a magnesium ion. And when the photon comes in, or when the resonance energy comes in from some of the antenna molecules, electrons in the double bond sitting here in the porphyrin head get excited. Those are the electrons that we're talking about. And they get excited. And the first electron acceptor is this pheophytin that I just talked about. It actually looks just like a chlorophyll, but it has no magnesium ion in the middle. And maybe I'm getting a little bit into the weeds a little bit too much. But the pheophytin you actually see in this diagram right here, it's part of this photosystem complex. So the electron, you can imagine it jumping from the chlorophyll to the pheophytin that does not have that magnesium in the center. And when it sits in the pheophytin, it's at a very, very, very, very high energy state. And then it keeps being transferred from the pheophytin. It goes to the plastoquinone. So maybe we go to a slightly lower energy state here. We keep using the electron in green. Then it keeps going to a slightly lower energy state in the cytochrome B6F complex. And then you have the plastocyanin complex lower energy state. And then eventually it goes into photosystem I at an even lower energy state. Maybe slightly higher than the energy state that was originally in the chlorophyll A molecule in photosystem II. Another photon or another set of photons comes and hits photosystem I, maybe its antenna molecules, through resonance energy that excites the electron. It might directly hit the chlorophyll in photosystem I in its reaction center. And then this gets excited again. This gets excited again. And so once again, we have an electron with a high potential that can keep going from one molecule to another as it gets more and more comfortable. And this releases energy that can drive the proton pump. And it eventually ends up in the NADPH at a fairly high level of energy still. This electron can still be transferred to other things and release energy. And we'll see that when we talk about the light independent reactions. Now the whole point of me showing you this is I wanted to kind of depict graphically that the electron is starting off at a pretty low energy state. And the only way this happens is by energy from light. This would not happen on its own, going from a low energy state to a higher energy state. And I touched on in the last video, if you have this electron going here and it gets transferred from one molecule to another, gets excited again, then keeps going all the way, eventually being accepted by the NAD plus to become NADPH. Where does that H come from? You could say, well, that H is a proton. It gets that electron. And then they merge together and you have NADPH. But either way, the question is, what replaces this electron? And that's where that amazing thing that I talked about in the last video happens. Water gets oxidized. Oxidizing is losing electrons, oil rig. So water gets oxidized by the water oxidation site on Photosystem II. And that electron ends up and replaces the electron in the chlorophyll. So once again, that's an amazing idea that you're oxidizing oxygen. So the net effect of what's happening is you're using energy, using this photon energy right here, to essentially strip electrons off of water. And when it's on water, it's spending most of its time on the oxygen. So essentially strip electrons off of oxygen and put them in a higher energy state and have them end up on NADPH. And in the process, it had gone to an even higher energy state, and as it goes down to NADPH, you're pumping protons across the membrane. That we learned in the last video through chemiosmosis eventually goes through the ATP synthase channel, turns around this part of this protein complex or enzyme complex, and actually generates ATP. ATP from ADP and phosphate groups. And in the electron transport chain video, when I talk about cellular respiration, I give a visual concept of how this actually might happen, how you could, as these go through, you actually can jam together the ATP and the ADP. And so that's another question in my head is, we talk about these electrons going from one molecule to another, but how does that actually pump hydrogen through? And I'm just going to do a very gross oversimplification. I'm sure it's much more complicated in actual plant cells. But you could imagine that we have our pheophyton right here that has that electron on it right there. Maybe it has its electron right there. This is a gross oversimplification. And then you have your plastoquinone right here. That's the next acceptor. Now maybe on this protein complex right there, the point that wants to accept the electron is right there. And let's say that there's another point on it that can accept a hydrogen. So you can imagine when it's on this side of the membrane, a hydrogen can become attached right there. And this guy will want to be attracted to that. So he'll rotate around. So you can imagine if it was kind of a wheel, this attraction, because the electron wants to go into a lower energy state right here, it'll rotate around. That'll allow essentially this hydrogen as it rotates, as this molecule, as this protein rotates around. This hydrogen will be able to cross the barrier. And then once this guy and that guy meet, then the hydrogen will be on the other side. And so it can freely go away again. So that's at least in my head how I imagine electrons going from a high energy state to a low energy state, how that can actually drive a reaction. Remember, the electrons want to do this. So they'll attract the different parts of the molecules together. And as those molecules turn and rotate and move, that can help facilitate hydrogen going from the stroma, the outside of the thylakoid, to the inside of the thylakoid that'll drive the chemiosmosis later on. Now there's one other point I want to touch on here. Everything I've described so far, we started an electron in water. And obviously when water loses its hydrogens, it loses both the hydrogen protons and the electrons associated with it, you end up with just water. So you start off with hydrogens, and then you end up with just O2, and then the hydrogen protons, the electron got taken up by the chlorophyll. When you start off with that, we've seen already that you end up with the electron sitting in NADPH. The electron sitting out here in NADPH. So at some point, you have NAD is the final acceptor. You have NADP plus is the final acceptor, and it becomes NADPH. You can imagine it accepts maybe a hydrogen proton from out here, accepts the electron from this electron transport chain in photosynthesis, and then becomes NADPH. And then that travels in the stroma, which is where the dark reactions occur that actually produce the carbohydrate. But this idea of an electron going from water to NADPH, this is called noncyclic photo phosphorylation. It's called noncyclic because you're not reusing the same electrons over and over again. The electrons start off, depending how you view it, chlorophyll or the water, and they end up in the NADPH. Now there's another type of photo phosphorylation. You might guess what it's called. That's called cyclic photo phosphorylation. You'll see when we study the dark cycles, or the Calvin cycle, or the dark reactions, or the light independent reaction, that it uses a lot of ATP. Actually, ATP in disproportionate to the amount of NADPH it uses. It uses both, but uses a ton of ATP. So cyclic phosphorylation only produces ATP and actually does not oxidize water. So what happens in that situation is this electron, after it gets activated or as it gets excited in photosystem I, it's the electron. It eventually ends up, instead of at NADPH, it ends up at photosystem II. So instead of this guy having to be replaced by electrons from water, this guy in cyclic photo phosphorylation ends up, well maybe I should do it from here, ends up getting replaced by the original electrons. It gets excited here, goes from molecule to molecule, lower energy states. Hydrogen gets pumped into the lumen, gets excited again in photosystem I, and then enters lower and lower energy states, but then ends up again in photosystem II. That is cyclic photo phosphorylation. So you can imagine, in this situation, since the electron never ends up at NAD+, you don't end up producing NADPH. And since you're replacing this electron from the photosynthesis or from the electron transport chain directly, you don't have to strip the electrons off of the water, so you're not going to produce your oxygen. So in this situation, so this non-cyclic phosphorylation, which is kind of what most photo phosphorylation is, what most people associate with photo phosphorylation, this produces O2 and NADPH. And of course, it produces ATP. While cyclic phosphorylation, because it doesn't have to strip electrons off of water, and the electrons don't end up at NADPH, only produces ATP. So I think we now have a very good understanding, hopefully, of the light reactions in photosynthesis. We're now ready to take the products of this. And let's remember what the products were. The products, well, the oxygen just gets eliminated. We don't need the oxygen anymore, but that goes into the atmosphere, and you and I can breed that, and we can use that for cellular respiration. But in the photosynthesis context, we've now generated a bunch of ATP, and now we have a bunch of NADPH, and we can use that in conjunction with carbon dioxide to produce actual carbohydrates in the stroma outside the thylakoids. But we're still inside of the chloropas, and I'll cover that in the next video.
