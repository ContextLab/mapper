Alright, part c. At what time t, where t, where zero is less than or equal to t is less than or equal to eight, is the amount of water in the pipe at a minimum? Justify your answer. Alright, well let's define a function w that represents the amount of water in the pipe at any time t, and then we can figure out how to figure out the minimum value for w over that interval. So let's just say w of t, so that's the amount of water in the pipe at any given time t, it's going to be equal to, well we start with 30 cubic feet of water in the pipe at t equals zero, they tell us that right up here. So we start with that much, and then we are going to add or take away some amount. So then it's going to be plus, we're going to sum up from time zero to time t, remember this is a function of t. Well let's sum up our net inflow times little small changes in time, and we'll sum up all those small changes in time from zero to t, and that'll give us our aggregate inflow, our aggregate net inflow. So what is our net inflow? Well you have the function r, which says the rate at which the water is entering, and your function d, which is the rate at which water is exiting, and instead of using t as our variables here, I'm going to use x, since t is already one of our variable, or is one of our boundaries of integration, and we can use any variable we want, it's really just a bit of a placeholder variable for the integration. So our net inflow is r, I'll say r of x, minus d of x, and then dx. Once again, this is our net rate of inflow, this is our inflow minus our outflow, so our net rate of inflow, times small changes, you could view this as time, although it's x, and then we sum up from zero to time is equal to t. So this is how much water we are going to have in the pipe at any time t. So let's now think about at what point does w hit a minimum in this interval? And there's three possibilities where w could hit a minimum point. It could have hit a minimum right at the beginning, at w of zero, it could hit it at the end of our interval, at w of eight, at t equals eight, or it could be someplace in between where w is at a local maximum point, in which case the derivative of w will be equal to zero. So let's first evaluate w at the end points. So w of zero, well we know that, that's the bounds are going to be zero to zero, but they even gave that to us in the problem. It's the initial state is we have 30 cubic feet of water in the pipe already, and now what is w of eight? Well this is going to be 30 plus the definite integral from zero to eight of r of x minus d of x minus d of x dx. And lucky for us, we're allowed to use a calculator, so let's use a calculator to evaluate this. And so let me get my calculator out, and actually let me go see the definitions of r of x and d of x right over here, so I can type them in. And what I'm going to do, and there's a bunch of ways, the more advanced you get with a calculator that might save you some time if you're on the AP test, I'm going to actually define a function that is r of x minus d of x. So everywhere I see a t, I'm going to substitute it, I'm going to use an x instead. And then I could use that later on to integrate it or to solve it in some way, so let's do that. So y one is going to be 20 times sine of x squared divided by 35, close parentheses, minus, open parentheses, you have negative 0.04 times t to the third power, or so I'll write, times x, x to the third power, plus 0.4 times x squared x squared plus 0.96 times x, and then I can close these parentheses. So does that make sense? 20 times sine of x squared divided by 35 minus negative 0.04 x to the third plus 0.4 x squared plus 0.96 times x. All right, there you go. I have defined y one, and now I can use that to evaluate different things. So let me now go back here, and so let me evaluate what this is going to be. This is going to be 30 plus the definite integral. I'll go to the math functions. You scroll down a little bit, you have, this is the function for definite integral, function integral, and the function is y one, and I can go to vars, go to my y vars, it's going to be a function variable. So y one is what I select. I could have typed it in, but this will hopefully save time and I can reuse y one. And my variable of integration is x, and I'm going from zero to eight. From my lower bound is zero, my upper bound is eight, and let's see, did I type everything in? All right, and then let it munch a little bit, and there you have it. It's approximately 48.544 cubic feet of water at t equals eight, so let me write that, 48.544. So this is approximately 48.544 cubic feet. And now let's see if there's any point in between where w hits a local maximum point, or a local minimum point, I should say. I think I said a local maximum earlier on. I should say a local minimum point. And so if it's at a local minimum or maximum point, really, the derivative of w is going to be zero. So let's see, at what t do we get a zero derivative? So w prime of t, well the derivative of a constant with respect to t is zero, and the derivative of this with respect to t, and this comes straight out of the fundamental theorem of calculus, this is going to be r of t minus d of t, where once again, this is a function, we have t as the upper bound, and so we have whatever here that we were integrating, but it's now going to be a function of t. And so in order for this to be equal to zero, we need to figure out when does r of t minus d of t equal zero? And lucky for us, we've already typed in r of t minus d of t, we've defined that as y sub one on our calculator. So let's go back here, and now I can use the solver. So go to math, and then let's see if I scroll up. Let's see, I get to the solver, I could have scrolled down as well, it's right below definite integral. So I go to the solver, and I say the equation zero equals, and now I could just go to y one. So go to my y variables function, I select y one. So my equation is equal to y one, and I press enter. And now I could put an initial guess for what x value is going to solve that equation, it's really a t value, but I'm using x as a variable here. And now I do alpha, and I click solve here, it's a little blue you see right above the enter. And it gets to, it gets to, well zero is one of them, let's see if I can get another one. So let's see if I can get, see if I start at two. Alpha, solve, let it munch on that a little bit. Okay, so this is actually within the interval. So approximately 3.272. So t is approximately 3.272. That's where we have a local minimum point, but now we have to evaluate w there. So we have to evaluate w at 3.272 to figure out if is it truly lower than w of zero. W of eight is even higher than w of zero. So how do we do that? Well luckily we can go back. So second quit, and that should be stored under the variable x. Yep, it's right there. So then we can say, well let's calculate. We wanna calculate the function evaluated when t is 3.272. So our function is 30, 30 plus the definite integral. Go to the math, so definite integral. And once again we have y one. So let me go to my y variables function y one. We already defined that as r of x minus d of x. Our variable of integration is x. Our lower bound is zero, zero. And our upper bound is 3.272, which we stored in the variable x. So we can actually, it's a little confusing. This is saying what's our variable of integration. This is the actual variable, this is the actual value for our upper bound. And so let's munch on it a little bit. And we get 27.965. So this is approximately equal to 27.965. So now we're ready to answer, at what time t is the amount of water in the pipe at a minimum? We can see that at time 3.272, we have less water in the pipe than either right when we started or right at the end of our interval at t equals eight. So at what time t? We say t is equal to 3.272. We could write w of 3.272 is less than w of zero, which is less than w of eight. So this indeed, just by knowing that the derivative there is zero, it could be a minimum or a maximum, but the fact that it's lower than both of the endpoints, this tells us that hey, this is a minimum. Minimum point right over there. Or we could say that t equals 3.272 is where we hit our minimum value.
