- [David] Howdy, wordsmiths. I reckon it's just about
time for us to saddle up and get to knowledge town. Hyah! I've got three, count 'em, three words to
go through with you today, so let's get to it. The words are simulate,
leisure, and recreation. I'll go through some definitions and then we'll talk about
some of the word parts that make up these words. Simulate. This is a verb that means to imitate, to create an imitation
that looks or feels real. A simulation is a noun, it's a virtual environment like on a computer, or an
imitation of something, right? A flight simulator is a
piece of computer software that lets you practice flying an airplane. This was the flight
simulator of my childhood, and lemme tell you, I was very bad at it. Do not let me fly a plane. I am not ready. Leisure or leisure. It's a noun. It means free time. It's what you do when
you're not at work or school and when you're not asleep. About 200 years ago, people with factory jobs
worked horrible hours and fought for the eight-hour workday. Eight hours of work,
eight hours of leisure, eight hours of sleep. That was their goal. And what do you do during
those eight hours of leisure? Recreation. A noun, it means
entertainment and relaxation. Things you do for fun,
things you do recreationally. Hanging out with friends and family, riding bikes, playing games, listening to music, going on adventures, eating meals, playing sports, wandering, daydreaming, reading books. You know, the very stuff of life itself. All right, let's break down these words. Simulate comes from the Latin similis, meaning the same or resembling. So our root, which you'll
see in other words, is simil. Compare the word similar. Something that is similar is like or resembles something else. A green apple is similar to a red apple in that they are both apples. And this is a simulated
apple, in that it is not real. It is a ceramic apple. You can't eat it. Leisure is sort of a word origin dead end. It ultimately comes
from the Latin root lic, meaning to allow, from which we get words
like license or illicit. But leisure is kind of a
funny one in this category, it's the only word that comes from lic that changes the spelling
of the root in this way. Recreation uses that prefix re, which means again. Hundreds of years ago, this word originally meant
recovery from illness in that you were taking
the opportunity by resting to create yourself again, to recreate yourself back
to your healthy state. But now it means doing things for fun, which, when you think about it, is also a way to get yourself
back to a healthy state. Let's use these words in some sentences. I enjoyed my visit to the
Museum of Historical Robots, but I couldn't understand
why the simulated version of Abraham Lincoln was rapping at me. He's a historical robot, so he's not the real Abraham Lincoln. He can only ever be a simulation, a fake version of the real Lincoln. Most people wouldn't
sort jelly beans by color as a recreational activity, but Adrian found it very relaxing. Most people don't do it
for fun, but Adrian does. Personally, I have done this before, and I must admit, I do also
find sorting candies by color to be a pretty pleasant thing
to do for like 40 minutes. All right, next one. Many of his favorite leisure activities, spreadsheet racing,
competitive tax form filling, high-speed pencil sharpening, were things most of his
friends wouldn't do for fun in their spare time. Now, are these things you or I would like to
do in our free time? Maybe the pencil sharpening
one to be honest, I think I'd be pretty good at that. All right, I'll see you in the next one. You can learn anything. David out.
