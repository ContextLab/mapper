Oh boy, oh jeez, Wordsmiths, I'm not feeling so hot about this word, I tell you what. The word is anxious. Anxious. Or if you prefer, anxious. It's an adjective that means very worried. You might see it in its noun form, anxiety, which is the state of being very worried. If you trace this word back to its origins, you get the Latin word anguere, which means to choke or to squeeze. When I feel anxious, sometimes my throat gets tight and my heart hammers in my chest and listen, Wordsmiths, it's a bad time. And that OUS part, us, is an adjective-forming suffix. It means full of. Right, so being anxious is being full of that choking, squeezed feeling. So, a real fun one this time, huh? So I'll take a deep breath, think of a calming, centered place, and come up with some related words, some similar words that sound like anguere or OUS, that end in OUS. I'll put on some calming music. Ten seconds, here we go. Here are three that I came up with. We've got anguish. It shares the same root as anxious, that anguere word, and it means misery, torment, very deep unhappiness as if you were being choked or squeezed, agony. Okay, next word, anger. This is an interesting one because anger looks a lot like anguere but actually traces back to old Viking languages, not Latin. But it comes from an even older shared root, a common ancestor of Latin and the Viking languages. So it has the same meaning, squeezed or painful. And from there we get anger, hostility, feeling constricted and squeezed. And finally, furious, using that OUS ending. It means full of fury, full of anger. I promise I'm having a very normal day, wordsmiths. There's just something about this derivation that puts me on edge. Okay, let's use anxious in a sentence or two. At first, Bettina felt anxious about hiking Needle-Teeth Gorge but felt reassured when she remembered that her aunt Isabella was a trained wilderness guide. Needle-Teeth Gorge does not sound like a fun or safe place to go for a hike. To me, Bettina's worries are understandable. Let's try another one using the noun form of the word anxiety. Based on what you told me, it seems like potatoes are the cause of your anxiety, Dr. Gomez said. Sometimes it helps to talk to someone about your feelings, potato related or no. Deep breaths, wordsmiths. You can do this. You can conquer your anxiety and you can learn anything. David out.
