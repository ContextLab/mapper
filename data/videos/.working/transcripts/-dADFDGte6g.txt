Let the function f be defined by f of x is equal to ax to the third plus b, where a and b are constants. If f of zero is equal to two, and f of two is equal to three, which of the following must be true? When they say a is greater than zero, b is greater than zero, a is less than b. So let's look at each of these constraints right over here. So we have f of x is equal to ax to the third plus b. And they say f of zero. So what is f of zero going to be? f of zero. Well, this whole term is going to be a times zero to the third. So that's just going to be zero. So f of zero is going to be equal to b, which they tell us is equal to two. So we know that b is equal to two. So now we know that f of x is equal to ax to the third plus two. Then they tell us f of two is three. Well, what is f of two? And I'll just switch colors somewhat arbitrarily. So f of two now is going to be a times two to the third power plus two. Well, this is going to be equal to 8a plus two. And they tell us that that is equal to three. That is equal to three. So we have 8a plus two is equal to three. Now we could solve for a, actually. So let's subtract two from both sides. And we get 8a is equal to one. Divide both sides by 8. a is equal to 1 eighth. So which of these are true? a is greater than zero. That's true. b is greater than zero. That's true. a is less than b. 1 eighth is less than two. That's true as well. So all three are true.
