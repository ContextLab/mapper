This is ConMigo, an AI-powered guide designed to help all students learn. ConMigo is not just for students, though. Teachers can use ConMigo, too. In fact, when teachers access ConMigo, their device will transform into the teaching assistant they've always wanted. Let's take a look! Upon entering ConMigo's dashboard, you're able to see all of the wonderful things that ConMigo can do. ConMigo can give you a class snapshot into your student's activity the last seven days. It can summarize your student's chat history so you can see what they've been up to. Need help with an upcoming lesson plan? ConMigo can help with that, too. Feeling iffy about a lesson that you're about to teach? ConMigo's refresh my knowledge will help you prepare for it. I can use ConMigo to help me come up with a creative lesson hook that gets my students excited about an upcoming lesson. ConMigo can help me write learning objectives for that unit, as well. ConMigo can help me create a writing rubric for my student's next essay or assignment. And ConMigo can write unique, thought-provoking exit ticket questions that I can use as checks for understanding. I can also use ConMigo to collaborate with my students to create a fun class summary poem that I know they'll love. Ready to see ConMigo in action? Great! Me, too! I'm going to start off with refresh my knowledge because next week I'm covering a unit on the parts of speech and it's been a little while. So I'm just going to type in parts of speech. I also have to let ConMigo know my grade level. 7th grade. Amazing! With one click of the button, ConMigo is able to give me an overview of the five major concepts and then offers to support me a little bit more by offering to quiz me on the topic and learn through conversation. Now, I want to come up with a creative lesson hook for my students. So we are going to cover nouns. These are good, but I would like to make it funny. So ConMigo, can you make it funny? Absolutely! Humor is a fantastic way to engage students. I couldn't agree more. Thank you so much, ConMigo. Now, could you help me create a lesson plan on nouns to introduce the topic to my students? I would love one on introduction to nouns. And again, with one click of the button, ConMigo creates an incredible lesson plan for me. Wow! This is incredible! Okay, can we please print this? This is amazing! ConMigo included the learning objective, the activities that my students are going to do, the exit ticket, key terms, the resources that I'm going to need, and then a lesson summary. This is absolutely incredible. In just a few minutes, ConMigo, my new teaching assistant, has saved me so many hours of planning time to help me create a quality lesson plan for my students. Incorporating ConMigo into the classroom is going to be a game changer for teachers. ConMigo's insights and suggestions are going to enhance classroom learning and make teachers' lives easier by saving them so much time so that we'll have the ability to focus on what's important, our students. Thank you, ConMigo.
