In the last video, I started introducing the intuition for the Laplacian operator in the context of the function with this graph and with the gradient field pictured below it. And here I'd like to go through the computation involved in that. So the function that I had there was defined, it's a two variable function, and it's defined as f of x, y is equal to three plus the cosine of x divided by two multiplied by the sine of y divided by two, y divided by two. And then the Laplacian, which we define with this right side up triangle, is an operator of f and it's defined to be the divergence, so kind of this nabla dot, times the gradient, which is just nabla of f. So two different things going on, it's kind of like a second derivative. And the first thing we need to do is take the gradient of f. And the way we do that, we kind of imagine expanding this upside down triangle as a vector full of partial differential operators, partial x and partial y. And with the gradient, you just kind of imagine multiplying that by the function. So if you imagine multiplying that by the function, what it looks like is just a vector full of partial derivatives. You're taking the partial of f with respect to x and the partial of f with respect to y. Those are the two different components of this vector valued function that is the gradient. And in our specific example, when we take the partial derivative of f with respect to x, what we get, so we look over here, three just looks like a constant, so nothing happens. Cosine of x halves, the derivative of that with respect to x, we kind of take out that one half. So one half and the derivative of cosine is negative sine, so that's negative sine of x over two. And sine of y over two, well, y just looks like a constant, so sine of y over two is just some other constant. So in our derivative, we just keep that constant in there, that sine of y over two. And then for the second component, the partial derivative of f with respect to y, three still looks like a constant because it is a constant. Now cosine of x over two looks like a constant because as far as y is concerned, x is a constant, so cosine of x is a constant. But then the sine of y has a derivative of cosine, and we also take out that one half, so you take out that one half when you take the derivative of the inside, and then the derivative of the outside is cosine of whatever was in there, so in this case, y over two. And we're multiplying it by that original constant, cosine of x over two. So still we have our cosine of x over two, since it was a constant times a certain variable thing, x over two. So that's the gradient, and then the next step here is to take the divergence of that. So with that divergence, we're going to imagine taking that del operator and dot-producting with this guy. So if I scroll down to give some room here, we're going to take that vector that's kind of the same vector, the partial partial x, and I say vector, but vector-ish thing, partial partial y, and now we're going to take the dot-product with this entire guy, so I'll go ahead and just copy it over. Just kind of copy it over here, and let's see, so we need a little bit more room to evaluate this. So here, when you imagine taking the dot-product, you kind of multiply these top components together, so we're taking the partial derivative with respect to x of this whole guy, and when you do that, what you get, you still have that one-half, and then the derivative of negative sine of x over two, so that one-half gets pulled out when you're kind of taking the derivative of the inside, and the derivative of negative sine is negative cosine, so negative cosine of that stuff on the inside, that x over two. And of course, we still multiply it by this. This looks like a constant, the sine of y over two, and we multiply by that, sine of y over two, and then we add that because it's kind of like a dot-product, you add that to what it looks like when you multiply these next two components. So we're going to add, and you have that one-half, and then cosine of y over two, when we differentiate that, you also pull out the one-half, so again, you have that pulled out one-half, and the derivative of cosine is negative sine, so now we're taking negative sine of, and then that stuff on the inside, y over two, and we continue multiplying by the constant. As far as y is concerned, cosine of x over two is a constant, so we multiply it by that, cosine of x over two, and then that, so that is the divergence of that gradient field. So the divergence of the gradient of our original function gives us the Laplacian, and in fact, we could simplify this further because both of these terms kind of look identical, but the main point of this video is kind of how you go through that process, where you imagine taking the gradient of your function and then the divergence of that, and that's what the Laplacian is. See you next video.
