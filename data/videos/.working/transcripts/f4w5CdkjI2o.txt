- [David] Ah, wordsmiths. Welcome to my shop. Here I offer only curiosities. Would you like to see? Oh, I hoped you might. The words on offer today
are ingenious, experience, and evaluate. We'll go through their
definitions, explain their origins, and use each one in a sentence. Ingenious is an adjective that
means clever or inventive. Having lots of smart new ideas. Coming up with cool
inventions or solutions. Experience, it's both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it means something
that has happened to you, or knowledge or skills
gained by doing something. As a verb, it means to go
through something yourself. Evaluate, it's a verb. It means to analyze or examine something in order to form an opinion about it. Let's get into where
these words come from. For ingenious, let's
focus on two word parts. In means, well, in. And gen means born or created. It's the idea of skill or
smarts being an inborn quality, something you've either got or you don't. For my part, I don't
really think that's true. I worked very hard to know
everything that I know, and I bet you did too. Word origins aren't destiny. Just because a word has a particular origin doesn't make it true. Something to keep in mind. Related words to ingenious include, generate, to make, to produce. I can generate electricity
from these solar panels. Gene. A gene is a science term. It's part of the DNA inside your cells. And genius. A genius is a brilliant person, a uniquely smart or talented person. Or you can use it as an adjective to describe a particularly brilliant idea. A genius idea. In experience, let's focus on two parts. Again, ex meaning out, and pair meaning try, or test, or risk. If you've experienced
something, you've tried it out. Per, and this word is from Latin, and is different from
the Greek prefix per, which means through like
in persist or persuade. Words that use these word
parts include experiment, a process of testing things. An expert, a person who knows
a lot because they've tried and tested a great deal. And expel, to push out, to get rid of. And finally evaluate. I'm sorry that my Vs and Us
always look almost identical. It comes from the Latin word parts. Ex, again our old friend meaning out. Val, meaning worth or
strength from the Latin. While uate, to be strong, to have value. And ate, a suffix that makes
it into a verb, an action word. So, a verb forming suffix. To evaluate something, therefore is to pull the
value out of something, to analyze it. Other words with that vowel
root include valuable, something that's worth a lot
of money or is very important. Something that has a lot of
value, right, is valuable. Valid, something that is
strong or true is valid. A true statement. Or prevail, to win, to be
stronger than your opponent. Now, let's use these
words in some sentences. "We didn't have the money for
our movie's special effect, so Robbie ingeniously used mirrors to make it look like
the car was floating." He was very clever, he was very creative. He made use of what he had. "Marcy carefully
evaluated the shiny stone. Was it a precious gem or
just a piece of cut glass?" She examined the shiny stone
to develop an opinion about it, to determine if it was an expensive gem or just ordinary glass. "Rohit loved driving through
the automatic car wash, but he wanted to experience the suds for himself outside the car." He wanted to go through the process. He wanted to try it for himself, to experience the feeling of
being a car in a car wash. Wordsmiths, I'm so glad you
