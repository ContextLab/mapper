is three comma negative four, a solution to the equation five x plus two y is equal to seven. So there's two ways to think about it. One, you could just substitute this x and y value into this equation to see if it satisfies it, and we'll do that way first. And the other way is if you had a graph of this equation, you could see if this point sits on that graph, which would also mean that it is a solution to this equation. So let's do it the first way. So we have five x plus two y is equal to seven. So let's substitute, instead of x, let us put in three. Let's put in three for x. So five times three plus two times y, so y is negative four, plus two times negative four needs to be equal to seven. I'll put a question mark here because we're not sure yet if it does. So five times three is 15, and then two times negative four, two times negative four is negative eight. So the left-hand side, it simplifies to 15 minus eight, and this needs to be equal to seven. And of course, 15 minus eight does equal seven. So this all works out. This is a solution. So we've answered the question, but I also want to show you, this way we just did it by substitution. If we had the graph of this equation, we could also do it graphically. So let's give ourselves the graph of this equation. I'll do that by setting up a table. There's multiple ways to graph this. You could put it in a slope, intercept form, and all of the rest, but I'll just set up a table of x and y values. And I'll graph it, and then given the graph, I want to see if this actually sits on it. And obviously it will, because we've already shown that this works. In fact, we could try the point three, negative four, and that actually is on the graph. We could do it on our table, but I won't do that just yet. I'm just going to do this to give ourselves a graph. So let's say, let's try it when x is equal to zero, we have five times zero plus two times y is equal to seven. So when x is equal to zero, y is going to be, so you're going to have zero plus two y is equal to seven, y is going to be equal to 3.5. When x is equal to one, you have five plus two y is equal to seven. You're going to have five plus two y is equal to seven. If you subtract five from both sides, you get two y is equal to two, you get y is equal to one. So when x is one, y is one. And when x is, well let's try, let's try, well that's actually enough for us to graph. We could keep doing, but we could keep doing more points. We could even put the point three, negative four there, but let's just try to graph it in this very rough sense right here. So let me draw my x-axis, and then this right over here is my y-axis. And let me draw some points here. So let's say that this is y is one, two, three, four. This is negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four, I could keep going down in that direction. This is one, let me do it a little bit. One, two, three, four, and I could just keep going on and on in the positive x direction. So let's plot these points. I have zero, 3.5. When x is zero, y is one, two, three, .5. When x is one, y is one. When x is one, y is one. And so if we were to draw this line, I'll do it as a dotted line just so that I can make sure I connect the dots. I could do a better job than that though. So it will look something like that. And so if someone gave you this line, you said, oh well, it's three, negative four on this line, and let's assume that we drew it really nicely. This was all to scale. Let me try one last attempt at it. Let me do one last attempt at it. So it's going to look something like that. And if someone asks, is three, negative four on it, you could visually do it, but it's always hard when you actually don't substitute it, because you don't know. Maybe you're a little bit off. But if you're here, if you look at over here, you say when x is equal to three, what is y? Well, you go down here, and it looks like y is equal to negative four. So this is a point three, comma, three, comma, negative four. Obviously, in general, you don't want to just rely off of inspecting a graph. Maybe this was like three, negative 3.9999, and you just couldn't tell looking at the graph. That's why you always want to just substitute and make sure that it really does equal, that this equality really does hold true at that point, not just looking at the graph. But it's important to realize that the graph really is another representation to all of the solutions of this equation.
