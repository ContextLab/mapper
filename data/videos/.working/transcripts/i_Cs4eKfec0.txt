Let's now start thinking about counting the number of ways to do something, or the number of ways to arrange things. And so let's say we're at a small dinner party, and there are four people at the dinner party. Let's say there's person A, person B, person C, and person D. And they all want to be polite, and they all want to meet each other. Let's say they've never met each other before. And so they're all going to shake each other's hands, that each person wants to shake the hand of all of the other dinner guests. So the question is, how many handshakes are going to occur? If we assume that each person is going to shake each other person's hand exactly once. And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it, and then we can count out the scenarios together. So I'm assuming you've had a go at it. So one way to think about it is, well, each person, let's say person A, person A is going to shake how many hands? So you could say person A is going to shake the hands of person B, person C, and person D. So person A is going to engage in three handshakes. You could make the same argument that person B is also going to engage in three handshakes. He's going to shake person A, C, and D's hands. You could argue that person C should also engage in three handshakes. She'll shake the hands of A, B, and D. And then likewise, person D is going to engage in three handshakes. So in total, you have four people each engaging in three handshakes. So you have four people each engaging in three handshakes. So you have 12 handshakes. So my question to you is, do you feel good, do you feel good about this number? Pause the video and try to think about it. So let's actually draw it out. Let's actually draw all of the handshakes. I kind of went through this argument fairly fast. But I actually want to visually represent each handshake that goes on. So let's talk about all of the handshakes that A engages in. So A is going to shake B's hand. A is going to shake C's hand. A is going to shake D's hand. So it still seems consistent with what we have here, but let's keep going. We're then saying that B is going to shake A's hand. B is going to shake C's hand. And B is going to shake D's hand. Now let's keep going. Then we have C. C is going to shake A. C is going to shake B. C is going to shake D. And then we have D is going to shake A's hand. D is going to shake B's hand. And D is going to shake C's hand. And you're probably saying, well Sal, you just listed exactly 12 things. But there's something interesting here. We are double counting. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about where are we double counting? So I'm assuming you've had another go at it. But the realization, remember, we're saying that each person shakes each other guest's hand exactly once. So this is A and B shaking their hands. But this is also A and B shaking their hands. So we have double counted this. It's no different if B is shaking A's hand than A is shaking B's hand. This is exactly one handshake. Likewise, A shaking C and C shaking A. This is the same, I guess you could say this is, we're either saying that these are two handshakes, even though we're saying that people should only shake their hands once. So we're double counting. Likewise, we want this one and this one. This we are double counting, the way that we've described it. So if we're double counting, what should we do with this number 12? Well we should just divide it by two. Once again, over here we're counting when A shakes D's hand. Over here we're counting where D shakes A's hand, but that's really the same thing. So if we're double counting and we want to get the right thing, let's divide by two. And so four times three divided by two is 12 divided by two. We get a total of six handshakes. And if we want to see the six handshakes right here, let's get rid of all the double counting. So A, B is the same thing as this one, so let's get rid of that. A, C is the same thing as that one. A, D is the same thing as this one. B, C is the same thing as this one. B, D is the same thing as this one. And C, D is the same thing as D, C. So we are left with one, two, three, four, five, six total handshakes.
