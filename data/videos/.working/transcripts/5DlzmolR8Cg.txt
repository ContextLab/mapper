I want to write this expression here as a decimal. And the first question that might pop in your head is, do I multiply 4 times 1,000, then add 3, then multiply 1,000, then add 67, then multiply by 1 over 1,000? Or do I do the multiplication first? To answer that question, we just have to remind ourselves about order of operations. Order of operations, if you have a bunch of multiplication and addition in a row like this, you will do the multiplication first. So you will do the multiplication first. Let me put some parentheses here to remind us of that. So let's figure out what each of these expressions in the parentheses actually represent. What's 4 times 1 million? Well, that's 4 million. What's 3 times 1,000? Well, that's 3,000. What is 67 times 1,000? There's a bunch of ways of thinking about this. Actually, let me write them all over here. Well, I'll do the most obvious one right over here. 67 times 1,000 is 67,000. And we can represent this literally as 67,000. Or we could represent this as 60 over 1,000 plus 7 over 1,000. And what's 60 over 1,000? Well, 60 over 1,000 is 6 hundredths. So let me put that in a different color. 6 hundredths, 7 thousandths. So you could do this as 67 thousandths. Or you could do this as 6 hundredths and 7 thousandths. Either way, let's add all of these things together. So we have 4 million. So the 4 in the millionths place literally represents 4 million. Then we have no 100 thousandths. We have no 10 thousandths. But then we have 3 thousandths. So the 3 is in the thousandths place. Let me put a comma here so we can keep track of things. And then we have no 100s. We have no 10s. We have no 1s. We don't even have any 10ths. But we do have some hundredths. We have 6 hundredths. We have 6 hundredths. And then we have some thousandths. We have 7 thousandths. So we put that 7 in the thousandths place. So we could read this as 4 million, 3 thousandths, and 7 thousandths. Or we could read it as 4 million, 3 thousandths, and 67 thousandths.
