Plot the images of points D, E, and F after dilation centered the origin with a scale factor of 1 half. So we're gonna center around the origin and we wanna scale this thing down by 1 half. So one way to think about it is the points that will correspond to points D, E, and F are going to be half as far away from the origin because our scale factor is 1 half in either direction. So for example, let's think about point D first. Point D is at negative eight. So if we scale, if we have a scale factor of 1 half, what point D will map to is going to be at negative four on the x direction and on the y direction, D is at negative nine. So this is going to be at negative 4.5, half of that. So that is going to be right over there. That's where point D is going to be or the image of point D after the scaling. Now let's think about point E. E is two more than the origin in the x direction. So it's only gonna be one more once we scale it by half. And it's seven more in the y direction. So it's gonna be at 3 1 half. Seven times 1 half is 3 1 half. So we're gonna stick it right over there. And then finally F, it's six, its x coordinate is six more than the origin and its y coordinate is six less. So its image after scaling is going to be three more in the x direction and three less in the y direction. So it's going to be right over there. So we've plotted the images of the points. So if you were to connect these points, you would essentially have dilated down D E F with the center at with, and your center of dilation would be the origin. So let's just write these coordinates. Point D and point D remember was the point negative eight, negative nine, that's going to map to, well we're gonna take half of each of those. So negative four and negative 4.5. Point E maps to, well E was at two seven, so it maps to one 3.5. 3.5 and then finally point F was at six negative six. So it maps to three, it maps to three negative three. So the important thing to recognize is the center of our dilation was the origin. So in each dimension, the x direction or in the y direction, we just halved the distance from the origin because the scale factor was one half. We got it right.
