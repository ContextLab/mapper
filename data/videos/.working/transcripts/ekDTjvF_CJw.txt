Let's say I want to multiply 3.1, or 3 1 1 1 times, times 2.4, which could also be described as 2 4 1. So pause the video and see if you can do this, and once again I'll give you a hint, see if you can express these as fractions. So there's a couple of ways you can express it as a fraction. You could express this as 3 1 1 1 times 2 4 1. Two, do the same color. Two and four tenths. Now whenever you're multiplying, these are mixed numbers right over here, and mixed numbers are not the super straightforward to multiply. It's easier if they were written as what's often known as improper fractions, but essentially not as mixed numbers. So three is the same thing as 30 tenths. So 30 tenths plus one tenth, this is 31 tenths, times, two is the same thing as 20 tenths. So 20 tenths plus four is 24 tenths. 24 over 10. And hopefully this makes sense too, that 3.1, this three right over here, this is 30 tenths, or I could write, oh let me write 30 tenths, and this is one tenth. So this total is gonna be 31 tenths. Likewise, this two is 20 tenths, plus four tenths gives us 24 tenths. And now we can multiply. So this is going to give us, our denominator is pretty straightforward, 10 times 10 is 100, and then 31 times 24, we can multiply it in the traditional way, that we're used to multiplying two digit numbers. 31 times 24 is going to be equal to four times one is four, four times three is 12. Now we're gonna be multiplying in the tenths place, we're gonna put a zero here. So two times one is two, we're really saying 20 times one is 20, but you get the idea. Two times one is two, two times three is six, really 600, because it's 20 times 30, but I'm just following the standard, the method for multiplication, then you add these, and you're gonna get four, four, seven. So when you multiply these two things together, in the numerator you get 744 hundredths, which can also be expressed as, this is the same thing as 7 hundredths over, or 700 hundredths I should say, plus 44 hundredths, and 700 hundredths, well that's just going to be equal to seven. So this is seven plus 44 hundredths, which we could write as .44, that's our seven and 44 hundredths, and we would be done. And you might already be seeing a pattern. If you just took 31 and multiplied by 24, you get 744, and notice, I have one and two digits behind the decimal point. Notice I have one and two digits behind the decimal point. So think about whether that always works. Think about, and why that might work. If you just multiply the numbers as if they didn't have decimals, so you would've gotten 744, and you say, hey, I got two numbers behind the decimal, so my product is gonna have to have two numbers behind the decimal, why does that work? Or does it always work? And how does it relate to what we did here, which is converting these things to improper fractions, and then multiplying it that way.
