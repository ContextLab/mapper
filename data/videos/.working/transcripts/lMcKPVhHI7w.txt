We are told that Leela brought six liters of water to the picnic. Omar brought four thirds as much water as Leela and Zoe brought two thirds as much water as Leela. Put Leela, Omar and Zoe in order from the least to the greatest amount of water they brought. Okay, pause this video and have a go at this before we do this together. Okay, so let's just think about this. Leela brought exactly six liters of water. Omar brought four thirds as much water. So four thirds, this is greater than one. So this four thirds as much water, if I'm multiplying something larger than one times six, I'm gonna get something larger than six. So this is going to be greater than six. Four thirds as much water, it's going to be four thirds times six is one way to think about it, which is going to be greater than six. And then if we think about Zoe, Zoe brought two thirds as much water. Two thirds is less than one. So if I multiply two thirds times six, that's going to be less than six liters of water. So now we can put them in order. The person who brought less than six liters is Zoe. So Zoe is the least, we wanna go from least to greatest. Then Leela is in between, Leela. And then the most, because it's more than six liters, four thirds times six, that's going to be Omar. And we're done.
