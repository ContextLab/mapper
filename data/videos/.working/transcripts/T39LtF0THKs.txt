Hello teachers, welcome to the unit on financial goals. So this is what we, this unit we're going to build on some of the previous units for students and yourself to think a little bit about how they think about money and what they actually want to do with that money. So in terms of how they think about money, this is the money personality unit and who doesn't like figuring out, filling out a survey and figuring out their personality. We don't have quite have a survey here, but it is helpful for people to, and we know none of us fall into just one bucket, but it's always good to have a framework for what types of positives and weaknesses you might have when it comes to money, what types of biases that you might bring to the table so that you might be able to protect yourself and others against them. Charitable giving, this is a financial goal that you might have. We all want to have positive impact on the world and Khan Academy is a not for profit just reminding folks who are thinking of a nonprofit to give money to, but I'm glad that this is part of the discussion. And then smart goals, which is actually really useful even beyond financial literacy when you're thinking about goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound. So it's not just like, I wanna be successful. Well, no, that's not so specific or even measurable. The others, it might be somewhat true or it's not even time bound. So it's good for students and for everyone to be able to be a little bit more concrete with their goals and then to hold themselves accountable and to measure how they are doing against them. This next unit is about different time horizons of goals. Students, many young people think in the very short term, but it is good to think in the medium and long term as well. And then we go into ideas of net worth and a lot of people hear, oh, this person is worth that much, they hear terms like assets and liabilities, but this will give a little bit more specificity to what those words mean and hopefully make the kids a little bit more sophisticated. So as always, if you have limited time, I encourage you to go through the exercises which you could do very fast if you wanna just do the unit test to get a sense of things. But ideally watch all the videos, bring a little bit of your own story to this and encourage your students to talk about these ideas with their parents. Not only will it make these ideas hit home a little bit more, but it might in many cases help the parents.
