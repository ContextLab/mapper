I met a traveler from an antique land who said, Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies, Whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read, Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed. And on the pedestal these words appear, My name is Ozymandias, king of kings, Look on my works ye mighty and despair. Nothing beside remains, round the decay of that colossal wreck, Boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away. So this is a poem called Ozymandias written by a poet, Percy Bichelli, In the early 19th century, some of the language may seem a bit old-fashioned, But it's held up pretty well over the years, And we're going to use it today to talk about a second form of invention in college writing, Around the notions of recall and reflect. And this is a kind of writing you do typically in literature classes, Art classes, sometimes when you're doing personal essays, You're writing about your own autobiography, And you're trying to figure out in all of the experiences you've had, Which are the ones that are important, That you have that give you clues to new learnings about yourself, Or about what it is to be a human being. And this is kind of at the center of the whole journey of the humanities, Which is to get deeper and deeper into your understanding of who you are as a person, And how you interact with society and the various institutions that we all live among. So Sal and I are going to do an experiment here, Where I'm going to ask Sal to do some recalling and reflecting in relation to this poem. But before I say anything, just overall reaction to the poem as I was reading it, Any particular reaction? Yeah, I like it. If kind of my understanding or my impression is right, I mean, it kind of talks about something that, you know, I always like to, you know, talk to my friends and family about, Is, you know, just this whole notion of people being obsessed with their kind of, Their achievements in the near term, and their kind of ego gratification. But it's, you know, we're all these little animals on this little planet, And we have a very small lifespan, and we're going to go away, And that stuff is kind of silly in the scheme of things. In the bigger things. Okay, and this, by the way, the visual I always get from this is Burning Man. So I'm thinking about, you know, somebody ought to like put this statue out at Burning Man One year and sort of sort of have that. That's interesting. When I see this, I actually think of like Wall Street. Well, I think of kind of the power brokers or politicians, And I think of kind of how they view their world today versus What it really will be in the long term. Yeah, by the way, when you said that to me, The other thing that just called in my mind were the Oracle cylinders as we drive up. 101. So my name is the King of Kings, whatever. Okay. Well, okay. So here's the kind of the, when you have a poem like this, And you say, well, okay, so my teacher, the class assignment is to write something about this poem. Where would I start? So I like to ask people to do is to pick out, you know, just close your eyes. Don't look at the poem itself. Just thinking about as you heard it. What's the first detail in the poem that comes to mind? If my eyes are closed right now, I know people can't see me, but they are generally closed. And if I remember, you know, I, there was kind of this, you know, I bring kind of these, these two trunks and the sand and we're kind of in this very desolate environment is kind of what my memory of kind of how it was all starting. Gotcha. Stay, keep your eyes closed again. Another detail from the poem, just the second one that comes to mind. And then it starts talking about something kind of laying in the sand and my brain was like, is this as a person? Is this a thing? I at first started to imagine it was a person. Gotcha. Person or thing. Gotcha. Okay. Anything else from the poem that comes to mind? The broken visage of something. I remember that word in particular. Yeah. And yeah, I mean, those are kind of the, Okay. Let's use those three things. Okay. So as you're looking at those three things, let's circle them on the poem. So that one caught you, two vast and trunculus legs of stone. Trunculus legs of stone. Actually, I didn't actually capture the stone part the first time I heard it. Well, then it's okay. Stay with what you actually captured then. Yeah. Okay. So just to self-recapture. And then the second thing you said, something between lifeless things and what was it? I saw this, a half-slung shattered-vision lies. Okay. Okay. Shattered-vision lies. Shattered-vision lies. Okay. And on this part, I was like, what are they talking about? Is it a thing or person? Who knows? And then, yeah, the shattered visage. Okay. Okay. And then I underlied lifeless things because you said you didn't know if it's a person or a thing. And of course, by that time, it's pretty clear that it's a thing. No, it wasn't. Interesting. Maybe not. By the time I started talking about the pedestal where the words, I was like, maybe it's a dead body of some kind or something. Okay. Okay. Yes. By the time it was a pedestal, these words, then I kind of understood. Okay. So what's interesting is if we look at this thing, we say, okay, what is it about those images that you think is striking? I guess having random, just kind of having a random object in kind of this desert is almost more lonely than just a desert. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because, okay. So, object in the desert, right. Okay. I mean, you can't be lonely if there's nothing there. Right. If it's just desert, there's no, but yes, there's this one thing standing in the desert. So we talked, when I asked you your first reaction, you were reacting a lot to the bottom half of the poem. How does the idea of lonely relate to the bottom half of the poem in your mind? Well, from the poem's point of view, there's this relic is sitting here in the desert and it's clearly just this trace of this maybe once great civilization. And there's this irony that on that relic is written, my name is Azimandias, King of Kings. This isn't some of the small ego, right? He's not just saying king, he's the King of Kings. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair. How intimidating am I? I'm a big deal. And so, at one point, this is evidence of this maybe great empire, this egotistical king who thought he was almost a god. But it shows how futile his words were and how silly they seem from the perspective of now. Okay. So I think that's clearly, I think that's exactly what I, I'm pretty sure that's what the effect Shelley wanted to create. So now you say, okay, but Shelley wrote this poem in 18, I don't know, let's say 1810, that's within 10 years of being right. It's 2013, I mean, why do we care? Why do you care? Why does this touch you? Because these are still kind of themes that are alive in our world. I mean, you see people who are very much driven by empire. I mean, the 1800s was a period literally of empire for the world. But today, you still have people kind of blindlessly pursuing empire and numbers and money. And as you say, you don't take a moving truck to your grave. Right. Yes, right, the bank. But it's interesting that we've relocated it. So this was in a political military sphere. You and I both intuitively relocated it to Silicon Valley. And frankly, at least I internalized that to the tech industry in particular, and the financial services industry. Those were the two that we've, you were in financial services, right? Oh, both. I mean, tech first, and then I worked in finance. And I mean, I tend to give tech a little bit more of a free pass because I do think that especially Silicon Valley is more focused with impact and innovation than necessarily empire and legacy. While, you know, not all, I mean, these are huge stereotypes. I mean, very well balanced people in the financial world. But a lot of what you see, I mean, even the, you know, when you go to a place like New York, you see the skyscrapers. And these are, I mean, these are really, these are really kind of shrines to ego. Yeah, you don't have to do it that tall. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I think it's great. And to me, so the shattered visage, for me, is the exact, it's the face, which would be a person, but it's broken and it's in stone, and it's in the sand. And it's that image of what ego can do to personality. I mean, if you freeze on ego and don't let it kind of turns you into a lifeless thing, at least that may be that may not be you. That's probably me editing over you. But so what we're doing here, and we're going to bring this to a close, is so there's a poem here, it created an impression, when you listen to a poem or see a work of art, you get an impression. And part of what the exercise of literary criticism or artistic criticism is to recall the impression by coming back with the details that stand out most in your mind. They're the ones that somehow are key to the depth of the impression. And then just speculating about them to say, what does that mean to me? What can I learn about myself or about this experience that I didn't know before? And then use that. So let me just ask you as a way of closing, if you had to step back for this and say, this poem obviously confirmed a number of things you felt. Is there anything about the poem you said, well, but I don't know that I looked at it that way quite that way before? Is there something I learned from this poem specifically, or is this poem more just one more example of something I already knew? I think it's very, I mean, it's very in line with kind of how I often kind of, you know, when I get self-righteous with my friends who I'll now take out Ozymandias and just read it to them. And they're like, oh, he wants dinner now. Yeah, I mean, but, you know, it's, I think it has a power to it that, you know, just saying like, why are you, you know, we can talk with our friends over, over, you know, coffee and say, hey, you know, why are we really here? And why are we pursuing all this material stuff? And why are we so concerned about our titles and our position and our power and all of that? But I think, I think, you know, a poem like this has a nice way of really putting it in perspective. That's great. Okay.
