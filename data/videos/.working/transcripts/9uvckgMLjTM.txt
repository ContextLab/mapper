What I want to do now is start thinking about ancient civilizations, and we're going to start with Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia, the word is literally referring to the fact that this region is for the most part between two rivers. You have the Tigris River and the Euphrates River. And when we talk about ancient Mesopotamia, most people are referring to the period between around 3000 BCE, or maybe even going a little bit before that, so 3000 before the common era, and then going up to about the time of Christ, or a little bit before that. So we might go to 1000 BCE, or maybe a little bit later, maybe around 500 BCE. And what I've done here is we clearly have a map of the region. I also have timelines for different geographies. So this timeline that I have right here in blue, this is my timeline for Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia, right over here. And you can see that I have different colors along this timeline. And you can also see what other civilizations were around at the same time in history. And this is not a comprehensive list here. So what we have in this yellow, this is ancient Egypt. And you can see them sprouting out around the Nile. It's no coincidence that these are around rivers. The rivers flood and provide fertile ground where you can have agriculture, where you can support population centers. So it's no coincidence that you have a civilization around the Nile, you have a civilization in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. So this is the Egyptians right over here. This is ancient Mesopotamia. Right over here I have the Indus Valley civilization, and then we have China. And once again, not comprehensive. We have other civilizations going on, but these are ones that you will often hear being spoken about. Now in Mesopotamia, especially when we're talking about ancient Mesopotamia, you will hear about different groups and different languages. And so you'll hear about the Sumerians. Oftentimes they are most famous today for their cuneiform writing. And we'll do a whole, probably a whole series of videos as it's one of the original ways of symbolic writing that the Sumerians developed. You might also hear about the Akkadians. And the Akkadians, or both Akkadian could be referring to an actual empire, or it could be referring to the Akkadian language. And same thing about Sumerian. You might hear about the Assyrians. Assyrians. You might hear about the Babylonians. Babylonians. And all of these groups are associated with Mesopotamia. The Sumerians lived generally in this area right around here. In a future video we might talk about Abraham from the Old Testament is from Ur, which is a Sumerian city. And Sumerian is also a language. And it's a language that's not related to the languages that we now associate with the region, or the languages that were spoken by the Akkadians. The Akkadians, so if we're talking about languages that are similar to modern spoken languages, Akkadian was a Semitic language. Let me write that down. It was Semitic. So Akkadian is related to Arabic and Hebrew. And if we think about more ancient times, Aramaic. So all of these things were related. And the Assyrians and Babylonians, they were Akkadian, they spoke the Akkadian language, or if we go later on, they spoke Aramaic. But they were in constant contact with the Sumerians. So they even have Akkadian being written with a cuneiform type of script. And the general geographies were these different civilizations, these different empires sprung up from. So you have Nineveh right over here. That is the historical capital of the Assyrian Empire. And on my little line here, and this isn't exact, and we're learning more and more about this time period all of the time, you have to realize this, we're talking about 3,000 BCE, that's over 5,000 years ago. So we're still trying to put all the puzzle pieces together. But we believe around 3,000 BCE, there was a somewhat unified Akkadian Empire. Then it started to break up and split up. At some points, you had the Assyrians, you had the Assyrians more or less in control of the region. At other points, you had the Babylonians with the capital at Babylon. And we'll talk about famous Babylonian kings like Hummurabi and Nebuchadnezzar. And actually Babylon gets referred to a lot more. But for most of this time period we're talking about, the Assyrians were actually the dominant empire with their capital at Nineveh. Sumer, you see that here, Ur, where Abraham is from. That was more often part of these other empires. And so this is just to start to get us acquainted with this region of the world with Mesopotamia. As we go off into the next few videos, we'll continue to dig deeper. We'll talk a little bit about, we'll talk more about the cuneiform writing. We'll talk more about Hummurabi and his famous Code of Laws that seems to have influenced the Old Testament. We'll talk more about Nebuchadnezzar and his role. And he actually has a role in the Old Testament as well. And the interactions between these different civilizations. And it gets quite interesting.
