We're told that Bernard tracks the profit for his business for five months. The function P of X, and P of X is defined by all of this, models the amount of profit for Bernard's business of dollars, P of X, over X months. The transformed function D of X, which is P of X minus four, so essentially you just get rid of this plus four up here, models a different profit scenario. What is the best interpretation of the range of P of X as compared to D of X? So pause this video and think about it, and then we'll think about this together. All right, so let's just remind ourselves what range is. Range is the set of all of the possible outputs from a function, or if you think about it in this graph form, it's the range of all of the possible Y values. So let's write, let's make a little column here. Range, and we have two functions here. We have our original function, P of X, and then we have our new transformed function, D of X, which is P of X minus four. So first of all, P of X, what's the range of Y values that it takes on over those five months? So it looks like this minimum value right over here, I'm gonna eyeball it, but I'm gonna estimate it, looks like it's about 3500. Ideally they would have told us exactly that. But it looks like, well actually it's not a profit of 3500, it's a loss of 3500, it's negative 3500 here. And over the five months, the function would keep going, but we are bound, the domain I guess we could say is from zero to five months. So at five months, it looks like we are at, what is this looks like, about halfway between 11 and 12, so this is $11,500. So the range looks like it gets as low as, including, so that's why I'm putting a brackets here, $3500, 3500. Actually let me not put a comma there, that might get confusing, $3500. And it gets as high as 11,000, I said I wouldn't put commas there, $11,500. And now let's think about D of X. D of X is essentially at any given one, at the low point or the high point, everything is just shifted down by four. So this right over here, this is $4000, yeah this is listed in thousands of dollars, yes. So this is why, so thousands of dollars, so this is not just down by four, it's down by 4000. So this is negative 7500, so the low point is negative 7500, if I'm estimating correctly. And the high point, it looks like it is $7500, which is 4000 less than 11500, so 7500. So the best interpretation of the range of P of X compared to D of X, you could say, well the range gets shifted down by $4000. The low point is 4000 less, that's when the businesses had had a negative profit. And then the high point is $4000 less as well.
