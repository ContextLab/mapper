Most major air pollutants cannot be seen, although large amounts of them concentrated in cities are visible as smog. So this actually feels decent. It's not as cleanly written as I might like, but it doesn't seem like there's any outright errors, especially where they underline. So, of them, well this is large amounts of them. Well, the them is referring to the major air pollutants. So this is completely cool. Large amounts of them concentrated in cities. Well, that's just saying, well, these are the large amounts of the air pollutants concentrated in cities. This is making grammatical sense. Are visible, so we're talking about something that's plural, so it completely makes sense to use the plural form of the verb. So are visible as smog. So this makes complete grammatical sense. So I would say that this has no error.
