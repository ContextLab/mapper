In the video on dehydration synthesis, we saw how we could start with a glucose molecule, and through dehydration synthesis, form a bond with another glucose molecule. And just by doing that, you would form the disaccharide maltose, if these were both glucose molecules, but then you could keep going, and you could form longer chains of glucose molecules. And these things, where you take a monosaccharide, glucose is the most common example of that, and you create chains of these, we call these polysaccharides. Polysaccharides. This is a polysaccharide, and there's all sorts of interesting examples of polysaccharides all around you, especially polysaccharides of glucose, or things that are derived from glucose. This right here, this is a bowl of mashed potatoes, which is mostly starch, which is mainly just chains of glucose. So this right over here, let me do that in a color that's actually visible. So that is starch. The shell of a lot of insects, and things like lobsters, and the wings of these insects right over here, that's made of something called chitin. And chitin is also a polysaccharide. It's made of chains of, essentially a modification of glucose chains of that. That's chitin right over there. Very similar to starch in our muscles, we have glycogen, which is our store of energy, in our muscles. You have cellulose, which is actually probably all around you right now. Cellulose are things like, let me write this down, because this is something that is all around you, and you don't even realize it. Cellulose, this is what constitutes things like paper, and wood. It's involved in the cell walls of plants. This right over here is a picture of cotton, cotton in its natural form. Cotton is actually one of the purest forms of cellulose. It's roughly 90% cellulose. And if you take a zoom in on a cotton fiber, or actually a fiber of cellulose, you will see chains of glucose molecules. So you see this right over here. That is a glucose molecule. Then you see another glucose molecule, and this chain has been formed through dehydration synthesis. The difference between starch and cellulose are the main difference in terms of how this bonding has. With starch, the glucose molecules just keep forming the way that you saw in the video on dehydration synthesis, while in cellulose, they get flipped over. So you can see here, this oxygen is pointing that way, this oxygen is pointing that way, that oxygen is pointing that way. You can look up more about cellulose, but it's really interesting. What gives its structure are these hydrogen bonds that form between the partially negative, very electronegative oxygens on one strand, and the partially positive hydrogens on another strand. That's actually what give its structure. So really, really interesting things, these polysaccharides. But a question is, how do you actually break these things down? If I were to eat these mashed potatoes, how do I eventually turn this thing into glucose so I can use it for energy? The way that that happens is through hydrolysis. You can break down this word, the hydro. If you see hydro, the prefix hydro, that's a good clue that it has something to do with water. Then if you see lysis, if you're lysing something, this means that you're going to break it down. So this is breaking down something using water. That's exactly what happens with hydrolysis. If you have this polysaccharide, and let's throw a water molecule in there, we are going to add up, this water molecule is going to be able to break, it's going to be able to break one of these bonds. So we might end up with something like, we would end up, this chain could keep going in both directions, but we could end up with something that looks like this. That looks something like that. So half of this water molecule gets broken up, essentially to break this bond. It's the opposite of dehydration synthesis. So let's see if we can understand, get an overview of exactly how that happens. So this right over here, this is a maltose, this is maltose right over here, it's a disaccharide, it's just two glucose molecules attached to each other. If we kept doing this, if this kept going, if this guy had a bond to another glucose molecule, and this guy had a bond to another glucose molecule, we could be dealing with starch, or we could be dealing with glycogen. If this was flipped over in the chain, and they kept flipping over and over, then we could be talking about cellulose. But let's just think about how the mechanism, the mechanism by which this bond can actually be broken, it's really just the reverse of dehydration synthesis. So this is just going to be an overview of it. So we could start, this oxygen right over here, it's got two lone pairs, there's always a chance that if it bumps into something in just the right way, it could nab a hydrogen proton that is just sitting out there in the fluid. We're assuming that this is happening in an aqueous solution, it's happening in water. So it could just grab a hydrogen proton from maybe a passing hydronium molecule. And so if it does that, it would form a covalent bond and have a positive charge. And now relative to actually both carbons, but let's focus on this carbon right over here, this guy would be what we call in organic chemistry, a good leaving group. So these electrons, the oxygen might want to just take these back because hey, it's got a positive charge, oxygen is really electronegative. And so if things just bump in exactly the right way, if things interact in exactly the right way, you might have another water molecule, and this is where that extra water molecule is valuable in our hydrolysis. So let's say this is just another water molecule just passing by in exactly the right way. This could form a bond with that carbon right over there. And just as it forms a bond with that carbon, the carbon says, okay, I'm getting to share some other electrons, let me go of these electrons. So let's go of these electrons. And then what do you have left? Well, we can go over here. And so now this carbon has, let me color code it. So this bond that was just forming, that is this bond right over here. This oxygen is this oxygen right over there. It actually has another hydrogen attached to it, so let me do that. So right when it makes the bond, it'll have a positive charge. And then this bond right over here goes back to this oxygen. This oxygen right over here is that oxygen right over there. Now, when it started off, this guy grabbed a, this guy, and this, let me actually, the hydrogen proton that I grabbed, I showed an orange, that's this one. That's this one right over here. That's that one right over here. Now, this one grabbed a hydrogen proton, and now this one can actually give back a hydrogen proton to the solution. So if a water molecule passing by, I could just grab this hydrogen proton and then become a hydronium molecule. And so it took a hydrogen proton, is giving it back, and so what we are left with, but net, it took up this water to break, this water molecule right over here, to break the bond. And so this is a positive charge. It could be a passing hydronium molecule, and then it'll just hand it off, it'll just hand it off to that. And there you have it. We have our, we have two stand-alone glucose molecules right over there. We have broken the bond, and these each could be parts of chains, in which case we've just broken the chain, or if we're just dealing with maltose, now we've broken it down into the individual, into the individual glucose molecules. And the example here is with glucose, but it could have been the case, or with maltose, and it could have been the case with sucrose, where we break sucrose down using hydrolysis into a glucose molecule or a fructose molecule. So it's a very important reaction in biology.
