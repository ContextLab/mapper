I'm now going to give you a series of numbers, and I want you to figure out what the pattern is, and then tell me what the next couple of numbers are going to be. So let me give you some numbers. This number, and I have this number, and I have this number. And I want to know what the next two numbers in the series are. And you might want to pause it and try it yourself, because I'm about to tell you how to do this. Well, let's see. What's happening is we go from 6,342 to 6,442. What happened? Well, it looks like the only difference is the 3 became a 4 in the hundreds place. So we had one more hundred. So essentially, we added 100 here. We added 100. Or another way to add 100 is to increment the hundreds digit by 1. And let's see, when we went from 6,442 to 6,542, what happened? Well, the same thing. We had the hundreds digit 4, and we incremented it by 1. When you increment the hundreds digit by 1, 4 plus 1 is equal to 5, you're actually saying 400 plus 100 is equal to 500, because we're operating in the hundreds place. So we've added 100 again. So it looks like the pattern is each number is 100 more than the one before it. So let's add 100 again. So how do we add 100 here? How do we add 100 to 6,542? Well, we just increment the hundreds digit by 1 again. So now it is, instead of 6,542, it's going to be 6,642. We incremented the hundreds digit by 1, or added 100. And we could just keep going. We could increment it by another 100. And that's just adding 1 to the hundreds place. 6,742 would be the second number to add. Let's do another one. Here's the numbers. So that's 6,342, 7,342, 8,342. And this pattern, very similar to the previous one, but where are we incrementing right now? The 342 stayed the same, but the thousands are changing. We went from 6,000 to 7,000 to 8,000. So we're adding 1,000 every time. Plus 1,000. Plus 1,000. So let's just keep adding 1,000. So how do we do that? We increment the thousands digit. So to add 1,000 here, plus 1,000, we'd get 9,342. Now this is interesting. What happens when we add 1,000 to this? Well, we could say we have 10 1,000s. And when we actually read it, that's essentially how we're going to read it. But the way you should view this is you can never have 10 in any one place. We can't have a 10 in the thousands place. So now we're going to create even a larger bucket or a larger can, and that's called the 10,000s place. And that's going to be one place over. So now, instead of having 9,342 when you add 1,000 to it, you complete a bucket of 10,000s. So that allows us to say, well, we have one of this new super huge bucket called a 10,000 bucket. We have one of those, and that's where we put all of our 1,000s. So now we have no 1,000s left, because all 10 were put into that big bucket, and then 342. And this is essentially introducing, and I think we've done a couple of problems with that at that place. So now we have the 1s place. That's where the 2 is. The 10s place, that's where the 4 is, or 40. The 100s place, that's where the 3 or the 300 is. This is the 1,000s place, which you're familiar with. And now this is the 10,000s place. We have one 10,000 here. And the way we would read this is 10,342, and we added 1,000 here to get here. Let's do another one. So let's say I add. We're always starting with 6,342. And then let's say we go to that number. So what are we doing? In some ways, this is the simplest, right? The 1,000s are staying the same. 6,000, 6,000, 6,000, the 300s are staying the same. The 40's staying the same. We're just incrementing the 1s place by 1 every time. When you increment the 1s place by 1, you're just incrementing by 1. You're not incrementing by anything fancier than that. So we're adding 1 there, adding 1 again. So what's going to be the next one? Well, we just add 1 to the 1s place. It's going to be 6,345, adding 1 to 4. And then we have 6,346, adding 1 to 5 to 6, 346. Let's do one last problem like this. And every time you see the problem, you should just pause it and try to do it yourself first. That's the best way to learn. So we're going to start with our classic 6,342. So what are we doing right? We have 6,342, 6,352, 6,362. So we're incrementing the 10s place by 1. So when we're adding 10, when you add 10, you just increment the 10s digit by 1. We're adding 10. So the next one is going to be 6,300. Add 1 to this digit. We're adding 10 to the entire number. It gives us 72. And then we add 10 again, we get 6,382. Actually, let me give you a little plot experiment. What happens if we keep going? What happens if we keep adding 10? Well, then we go to 6,392. And now this is interesting. What happens when we add 10 here? Well, we want to increment the 10s digit. That's what we're learning. So if we just automatically did that without thinking, our four places would be 6,000 in the 1s place, 300 in the 100s place, 10 in the 10s place, and then 2 in the 1s place. Well, we can't do that. You can't have a 10. You can only have a digit there. You can't actually have a multiple digit number in any given place. So once you have a group of 10 in a given place, what you do is you combine them all up, and then you put them into the next highest place. So this is incorrect. That's incorrect. What you do is you take these 10, and you say, well, those 10s are actually equal to 100. So you would go, you would take these, and you'd essentially put them here. So you would add 1 to the 100s. So the next number is 6,402. And it also kind of makes sense if you just look at it visually. The 6 and the 2 stay the same, the 39 becomes 40. Anyway, you find a look at it that might be easier. Let's go back to some of the visual ways that we were viewing some of these problems before. So let me ask you a question. What is, let me pick a vibrant, bold color. What is 100 more than 3,624? And you might want to pause it and try it yourself. And I'm going to do it very visually for you. I'm going to draw you the 1,000s place. So how many 1,000s do we have here? So we go to the 1,000s place. 3,000, right? 3,624. So let me draw 3,000s. So 1, 2, 3. Let's do the 100s place. 100s. How many 100s do we have? We'll go to the 100s place. We have 600s. So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 600s. All right, let me see. I can write 100 here in each of these. 100, 100, 100, 100. OK, now we're in the 10s place. 10s place is there. We have two 10s. So 10s. Draw those out. That's 1, 2 10s. 10, 10. And then finally, we have the 1s place. That's there, 1s. How many 1s do we have? 1, 2, 3, 4. You could view these as the top of the cans of marbles, where these would be much bigger cans. Or you could even view them as some type of currency. Or if you gamble, you could use these as poker chips, where these are $1, $10, $100, thousands of dollars. So this is 1, 1, 1, 1. And this was over here. These reached 1,000. So what was the question? What is 100 more than 3,624? So we're essentially going to add 100 to this representation. So how do we add 100? Well, we're going to add 1 to the 100s place. We're going to add a group of 100. So let me add a group of 100. And I'm going to do it here, because I'm going to keep erasing it. So if I add a group of 100, it's going to go into the 100s place. And I'm just going to add another group of 100 right there. So now how many 100s do I have? Well, I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700. So now I have 700. And everything else stayed the same. So I have 3,000. This is 3,000. 700s. I have 2 10s. So that's 2 10s, or 20. And then 4 1s. 24. So what is 100 more than 3,624? It's 3,724. We just incremented the 100s digit by 1. Let's do a couple more like that. Let me erase this as neatly as I can. So I'm going to do different scenarios. So let's do another scenario. So I'm back to 3,624. And now I'm going to ask you, what is 1 more? What is 1 more than 3,624? Well, if I'm only adding 1, I'm essentially adding 1 more. We can call it $1 poker chip. And that'll go into the ones place. So we would add it down here. It's in the ones place. So now that we have, we have 3,000s. 600 still. You can count them. 2 10s. And then how many 1s we have? We added 1 chip here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So we get 3,625. So we just incremented or we just increased the ones place by 1 to go from a 4 to a 5. 3,625. Hopefully you're getting the hang of this. Let's do, oh, I didn't want to erase with the yellow. Let's do another one. I just want this to become second nature to you. Let's do another one. So what is, just going with the pattern, what is 10 more than 3,624? Well, if we're going to add 10 to the number, we're essentially adding a 10-denominated chip, or you could say a can of 10, or a group of 10, however you want to imagine it. So where would we add it? We're adding 10, so we'll add a group of 10 right here. Actually, I don't want to do it there because I want to be able to erase. Actually, that's fine. That's fine. And then how many is that? I've added 10. So what is my new number? It's 3,600. And how many tens do I have now? Well, I just added this one. So I have 1, 2, 3, 3 tens. So that's 30, and then I have the 4, 1 still. 3,634. So when I add 10 to this, what did I just do? Essentially, this 2 got increased by 1 to 3. And why is that? Because the 2 counts how many 10 buckets I have, and I just added one more to that. So that's 3,634. Let's do one last problem like this. This is actually quite enjoyable, I think. So I'm going back to 3,624. And now my question is, what happens if I add 1,000? So what is 1,000 more than 3,624? Well, if I'm going to add 1,000, that means I'm going to add a bucket of 1,000, or a can of 1,000 marbles, or a poker chip that is denominated 1,000. So I'd put it in 1,000's place. So it would go right there. Oh, that's not what I wanted to do. Undo that. It should look like that. There you go. So I add 1,000 there. 1,000, a bucket of 1,000. So now what is the number? How many thousands do I have? I had these three. I added 1,000, so now I have 1,200, 3,400. My 100's, I still have 1,200, 3,400, 5,600. I have 1,200, 2,200 is 20. I have 1,200, 3,400 ones. So my new number is 4,624. So if someone asked you, what is 1,000 more than 3,624? It's 4,624. I'll see you in the next video.
