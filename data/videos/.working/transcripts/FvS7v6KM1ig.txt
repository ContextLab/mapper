Factor out the greatest common factors. So let's write each of these terms and then factor them out. So I could write 4, let me color code it, 4x to the 4th, x to the 4th y is going to be equal to, I could do the prime factorization on the 4, that's just the same thing as 2 times 2. x to the 4th is just x multiplied by itself 4 times, x times x times x times x. And then finally I have a y. And then if I were to do 8x to the 3rd y, that is 8x to the 3rd, x to the 3rd power and y. Once again, I could do the prime factorization of 8, which is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2. x to the 3rd is x multiplied by itself 3 times, x times x times and then times y. And so the greatest common factor here is going to be made up of the largest common factors of these two things. So for example, both of these two characters have two 2's in them. So let's put two 2's in our greatest common factor. Both of them have two 2's. So we could have, let me write the GCF. So our greatest common factor is going to have two 2's in it. That's those two 2's right over there. And then both of these have at least three x's. So our greatest common factor can have three x's. I should say x to the 3rd, x multiplied by itself 3 times. So it's going to be times x times x times x. And then we also have a y in both of them. Both of these things are divisible by y. So our greatest common factor is going to be divisible by y. And so our greatest common factor is going to be 2 times 2 times x times x times x times y, which is the same thing as 4x to the 3rd. We're doing the right colors here. So this right over here is 4. This is x to the 3rd. That's close enough to blue. And then we have y. So what is 4x to the 4th y? Well, everything I've already boxed off is 4x to the 3rd y. That's the greatest common factor. And so this 4x to the 4th y is going to be the greatest common factor times what's left over. So if I were to rewrite this, this first term is going to be 4x to the 3rd power y. Let me put that in parentheses. And so this takes up all of the factors except for this last x right over here. Let me do this in a color I haven't used yet, except for this last x right over here. And so that's going to be that x. And you can verify, if you multiply this x times this thing right over here, you'd get 4x to the 4th y. Now let's add to that 8x to the 3rd y. But let's rewrite it as a product of the greatest common factor between these two terms and whatever's left over. So the greatest common factor, once again, is 4x to the 3rd y. It is 4x to the 3rd y. And I already wrote down 4x to the 3rd y. So that takes care of all of the things that I've already boxed off here. And all we have left is this 2 that is not taken into account by the greatest common factor. So I'm going to write the 2 right over there. And then we can essentially see we have two terms. Both of these terms have the greatest common factor in it. That's actually kind of by definition. This is the largest factor that goes into both of these. And we talk about largest factor. We're actually just talking about it has the largest. It shares the most factors between these two terms right over here. But with that out of the way, we can essentially undistribute it or factor it out. Factoring out is essentially the opposite of the distributive property. So it's the other way of applying it. So we can factor the 4x to the 3rd y out. When you factor it out, you're left with an x plus 2. And we have factored out the 4x to the 3rd y. And we're done.
