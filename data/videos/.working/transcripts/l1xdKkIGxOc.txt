A secant line intersects the curve y is equal to two x squared plus one at two points with x coordinates four and four plus h where h does not equal zero. What is the slope of the secant line in terms of h? Your answer must be fully expanded and simplified. So we know the two points that are on the secant line. It might not be obvious from how they wrote it, but let's make a little table here to make that a little bit clearer. So we have x and then we have y which is equal to two x squared plus one. And so we know that when x is equal to four, well what is y going to be equal to? Well it's going to be two times four squared plus one which is the same thing as two times 16 plus one which is the same thing as 32 plus one so it is going to be 33. 33. And what about when x is equal to four plus h? Four plus h. Well it's going to be two times four plus h squared plus one. Well that's going to be two times, let's see, four plus h squared is going to be 16 plus two times four h. So it's going to be eight h plus h squared and then we have our plus one still. And if we distribute the two, that's going to get us to 32 plus 16 h plus 2 h squared plus one. And then we add the 32 to the one. And actually I'm going to switch the order a little bit so I have the highest degree term first. So it's going to be 2 h squared plus 16 h and then plus 32 plus one is 33. And so we have these two points. We have one point four comma 33. And we have the other point, four plus h comma 2 h squared plus 16 h plus 33. And we just have to find the slope between these two points because the secant line contains both of these points. So how do we find the slope of a line? Well we do a change in y over change in x. So it's our change in y. Well if we view this as the end point, or this as the starting point, our change in y is going to be this minus that. So it's going to be 2 h squared plus 16 h plus 33 minus 33. Minus 33, those two are going to cancel each other out. And then over, what's our change in x? Well if we ended at four plus h, but then we started at four, it's going to be four plus h minus four. Four plus h minus four, these two cancel with each other. And we are left with 2 h squared plus 16 h over h. Well we can divide everything in the numerator and denominator by h. And what are we going to get? This is going to be one, that's just a one, and so this is just an h. So we have 2 h plus 16 over 1, or just 2 h plus 16, and we're done. This is the slope of the secant line in terms of h. And once again we just have to think about, well the secant line contains the point 4 comma f of 4, or 2 times 4 squared plus 1 right over here. And then I didn't call this f of x, but I think you get the idea. And then when x is 4 plus h, well this is going to be y, and we just found the slope between these two points.
