Hi, this is Dr. Maha Davin of Stanford University School of Medicine. I'm here with my good friend, Sal Khan. And we're following up to our earlier discussions about cervical spine injuries or neck injuries. And we're going to talk about some of the things you might do to manage a patient who might have a cervical spine injury in the case that you had to do something invasive like manage their airway. Right. When you say manage their airway, there might be something stuck in their airway or blocking their airway. Usually the tongue falls back and blocks the airway, but you're right. If your airway's blocked, you can't get air to your lungs. And if you can't get air to your lungs, you die. Right. And we said usually your tongue falls back. That's like normal. What are you talking about? When you're unconscious, the musculature, the muscles that control your tongue relax because you're unconscious. Your tongue falls back exactly. And it falls back into your pharynx, which is opposed to your part of your throat there. And that blocks the air from either going through your mouth or your nose into your trachea and then into your lungs. Really? So someone's just unconscious and they fall back like that? That might cause them to stop breathing? That would obstruct their ability to breathe. And so even if they were trying to breathe, they wouldn't be able to move as much air into their lungs. Okay. So it could be literally something as simple as moving the tongue out of the way. Exactly. And that's really what these first two diagrams show. The one with young boy there is showing a technique called the head tilt chin lift. Head tilt. Okay. So this is, he's laying down, they're pushing on his, okay, they're pushing on that hand down on the top of his head and then lifting up there. Exactly. And in doing so, in sort of tilting the head and pulling the chin up, what you're effectively doing is pulling that tongue out of the way and opening the airway so air can get into your lungs. I see. And this is a little off topic, but where did you get these pictures? These are actually pictures of my children. Yeah. I thought he was joking because they're clearly drawing. So I thought he lived in some type of animated reality, but no, apparently they are your children. That's my son, Aditya on the left and my daughter, Lavanya on the right. Okay. Someone traced them afterwards. They aren't. Absolutely. A very excellent medical illustrator. Change them from pictures into illustrations. Okay. Very cool. So sorry, that was off topic. And so the head tilt chin lift. But as we talked about earlier, if you had a spine injury, moving the neck or tilting the head could potentially cause an injury. And so in trauma victims, we tend to avoid using this particular technique and we use the one there on the right. I see. I see because they might be right. Something might have happened to their spine or their neck. And the last thing you want to do is turn their neck or flex or extend the neck. I see. Right. Because this is going to put a little pressure on the neck around that area. Exactly. And the bones can move and if the bones move, they can injure the spinal cord. So this is, whoever this person, whose hands these are. My wife's hands. These are your wife's hands? Really fast. It's a family affair. And so what is she doing exactly? She's doing a maneuver which we would use in someone who potentially could have an injury to the neck called the jaw thrust. And essentially what she's doing is she's grasping the angle of the mandible. Right. Exactly right there. Right. Kind of like a little 90 degree angle that we have. And pulling that mandible forward and in doing that, what she's doing is she's doing the same thing as the head tilt chin lift. Just she's not flexing the neck or extending the neck. So you're kind of just moving the jaw as opposed to everything else. And in moving the jaw, you're pulling that tongue forward and opening the airway. I see because the tongue's in there and right. So it's okay. That makes sense. And so this is the technique that we use for trauma victims. Right. Right. The reason that this is important is really shown in the x-rays. And what you see is the same person. And in the first x-ray, you can see as we talked about earlier, their spine is well aligned. So if you were to check their alignment and your vertebral body line. Yeah, I'm an expert at this. Post your vertebral body line, spinal laminar line, and spinous process line all look fine in this particular circumstance. But what you can see is if you remove the lines, you can see that there is a small fracture right there. Right here. Exactly. And right in front of that fracture, there's a bunch of swelling. All that stuff right there is your soft tissues. And so they're swollen. And what you can't see is that your whole cervical spine is held together by ligaments. And sometimes they can be torn. And you may not be able to see them on the x-ray. I see. How did you know they were swelling here? If you look at the x-ray, you can see that the distance between the front of the spine and the front of the soft tissues is widened. Then what you would normally see. Exactly. Exactly. It's usually very small, very narrow in that part of the cervical spine. I see. It makes sense. And what you realize is if a person were to come and try to open the airway, what happens on the next radiograph could occur. So if they use this technique right over here. Exactly. If they were to use the head tilt, chin lift, and were to tilt that head back. Oh yeah, put that pressure right there. Exactly. What could happen, the next x-ray shows. They push the, I want to use magenta. It's easier to see. So they push that back. Exactly. Wow. Okay. And now if you were to draw your lines again. Yeah. Specifically the anterior you might get away with. Yeah, but this one right here. The posterior line is abnormal. Right, right. And again, the key fact here is that right behind that line that you drew is your spinal cord. Yes, which is important. Which is right. And so one of the tenets of emergency medicine and medicine in general is do no harm. And here in an attempt to open the airway by this head tilt, chin lift maneuver, we potentially could do harm to the patient. Yes. Wow. Wow. Good first rule of thumb. Right. Right. The next step that we would take if just simply opening the airway wasn't adequate to get someone breathing again, potentially would be to actually intubate them or insert a plastic breathing tube into their trachea and allow them to breathe. And what you can see there is the act of intubation. So yeah, I've heard this word intubate a lot. My wife is a physician. I've always heard her here. So this is literally you're inserting a tube to clear things. You're inserting a tube to create a passageway from the oxygen rich atmosphere. Right. Right. And directly into your lungs. And again, if your tongue has fallen back and you can't keep it out of the way or you've vomited and you're unconscious. I see. This would be something that would help you breathe. How far does this tube go? It starts right at your mouth and it goes all the way down. It's a flexible tube I'm assuming. It's a flexible tube and it would go right in between this cartilage right here. So we'll kind of go right there. Exactly. Right through the larynx and right there where you've got the pointer there is where your vocal cords are and it would go just beyond the vocal cords. Right into your trachea. I see. Exactly. Exactly. That's because that's where you normally have something blocking. That is the connection between the oxygen rich environment. And after that then the oxygen can get to you at least some part of your lungs. You've got a tube now. Right. You've got an airway and you can give deliver oxygen to a patient through that tube. I see. I see. And what are they doing here? Why are they pinching? In this particular diagram what they're doing is a couple things. There's actually three people there. One person who looks like they're pinching is actually putting pressure on your cartilage, your cricoid cartilage. And they're doing that to push back and occlude your esophagus. What is occlude? They want to close off the esophagus because the esophagus connects the stomach. The stomach is full of whatever you had to eat. Oh I see. So you might be continuing to, the fluid could be coming out and all of that. So you want to, I see. So you want to, there could be stuff coming out from the stomach. Right and that tube, the esophagus runs right back here. And it could come up. Sorry. Show us how much I know what I'm adding. This is. Right. Exactly. Right. So you're right behind your airway right there. Right. And by pushing back you collapse the esophagus and prevent any what we call passive regurgitation. I see. So they're pushing this, let me do this in another color. They're actually pushing back and the esophagus is likely to get closed then. Exactly. So something can come from the stomach that doesn't close, the trachea is more rigid. The trachea is a rigid structure and this is right, this is actually the first ring of the trachea is a cricoid cartilage. I see. And that's what they're pushing on right there. I see. And when you push it closes the esophagus, trachea can still stay open. Exactly. Exactly. So there's three people. One person that we talked about is giving cricoid pressure and that would be that gentleman right there or a young lady. The second person is actually holding the head as you can see. And the reason that they're doing that is for what we showed earlier, they don't want that head to extend or flex. So they're actually holding the person in the neutral position to prevent those bones potentially from moving. Right. And they're just jiggling this thing through and if there wasn't someone holding it, it could do that same damage. Absolutely. And when you're that guy at the top who's trying to see the vocal cords and pass a tube, you don't care about anything else except for seeing the vocal cords. So you might inadvertently flex the neck or extend the neck. Right. That makes sense. Makes sense. Is that also why they said as an accident, don't move the person and that type of thing? That's exactly why. You, again, do no harm in trying to help the person by lifting them up or tilting their head or flexing their neck. You potentially could cause a- Right. And that's why they wait for the EMTs or whoever and then they'll absolutely- Absolutely. And if you really had to open their airway, you could use the jaw thrust maneuver. Right. Right. Just pull their jaw forward. Exactly. Pull them onto the- Exactly. We were talking right, we touched on right before this, there's other ways of doing this or there's other methods that people talk about? This cricoid pressure is quite controversial because one of the things that is supposed to help you with this procedure and some people feel that it may not be proven to help you or it potentially can cause injury but for those of us that are older, use this technique for a long time, still stand by it. Okay, this is what you all teach at the med school? Exactly. Okay, very cool. Well, thank you. This is very, very useful. You bet.
