Let inverted or upside down triangle X be defined as X plus one over X. Let me write that down. Inverted triangle X is equal to X plus one over X for all non-zero integers X. Alright? If inverted or upside down triangle X is equal to T. So if this whole thing is equal to T, where T is an integer, which of the following is a possible value of T? So let's think about this a little bit. So what you could try to do is you could take each of these choices and substitute it in for T and then try to solve for X and see if you can find X's that are integers. But instead of doing each of them one by one, let's just solve this, let's just rearrange this equation where we can solve for X as a function of T and then we could try the different T values out then and see, hey, can we get a non-zero integer value for X? So if we take this and if we multiply both sides by X, we're going to get X times X is X squared. One over X times X is one and then T times X is T X. Now it looks like we have a quadratic, we could try to get into a standard form so that we could try to factor it. So let's subtract T X from both sides. And so if we subtract T X from both sides, we are going to be left with, on the left hand side, X squared minus T X plus one and that's going to be equal to zero. Now this is interesting right over here. We have kind of a traditional quadratic equation right over here and we just have to think about, well, for what values of T can we actually factor this so that we get integer solutions for X? So actually let's just write down all the options over here. So if T is equal to one, then this thing is going to be X squared minus one X, we could just say X squared minus X plus one. If T is equal to zero, then this middle term disappears and you're just left with X squared plus one. If T is equal to negative one, then this thing becomes X squared negative negative one, so it's plus X plus one. If T is equal to negative two, then you get X squared plus two X plus one. And then if T is equal to, running out of colors, if T is equal to negative three, you have X squared plus negative three, so that's plus three X plus one. So which of these can you factor? Well, it might jump out at you that, hey, this is a perfect square right over here. I can factor this one. This is X plus one times X plus one. One plus one is two, and one times one is one right over here. So because I can factor this, I know that this right over here is going to be my answer. If T is equal to negative two, then all of this stuff boils down to that, and we could say that X squared minus T, which is plus two, plus two X plus one is equal to zero. The left-hand side is just X plus one squared is equal to zero, which means that X plus one is equal to zero, which means that X would be equal to negative one. So when T is equal to negative two, that means that X is equal to negative one, and negative one is a non-zero integer. You could look at these other ones and you say, well, this is very hard to factor. I need to take the product of two numbers who's positive one, and their sum is negative one. Well, I can't think of two integers that would do that. Same thing here, X squared plus one. How do I factor that? There's no obvious way, at least in my brain, of factoring that. Same thing over here. Two numbers whose product is one and whose sum is positive one. Well, I need two integers, and I can't think of any there. And same thing over here. Two numbers whose product is one and whose sum is three. I can't think of it, but this one right over here, you can.
