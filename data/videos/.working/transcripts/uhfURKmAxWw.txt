Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy. And as you might know, we are a not-for-profit organization with a mission of providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. And the way that we're able to do that is through the support of folks like you. Khan Academy is much more than me. We're over 100 people developing the math, the science, the humanities content that you've used and the people that you care about have used. The SAT prep, the team that's building out the adaptive software and allowing our content and our software to be localized around the world. None of that will be possible without your generous donations. So if you or anyone that you've cared about has benefited from this, I encourage you or I ask that you go to khanacademy.org and you think about making a donation of any size. Any size will help. And what's especially exciting is that between now and December 31st, every dollar you donate will be matched dollar for dollar up to $2.3 million. And so there's a great way to get a huge return on your donation. So with that, thank you for using Khan Academy. Thank you for supporting Khan Academy and I hope you have a wonderful holidays.
