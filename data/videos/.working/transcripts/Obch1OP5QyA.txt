rewrite the following equation in logarithmic form. So they have 100 is equal to 10 to the second power. So if we want to write the same information really in logarithmic form, we could say that the power, the power that I need to raise 10 to, to get to 100 is equal to two. Or log, log base 10, log base 10 of 100, is equal to two. Notice these are equivalent statements. This is just an exponential form. This is in logarithmic form. This is saying the power that I need to raise 10 to to get to 100 is equal to two, which is the same thing as saying that 10 to the second power is 100. 10 to the second power is 100. And the way that I specified the base is by doing this underscore right over here. So underscore 10, log base 10 of 100 is equal to two. Now here they ask us to rewrite the following equation in an exponential form. So this is log base five of one over 125 is equal to negative three. This is one way to think about it, is this saying the power that I need to raise five to to get to one over 125 is equal to negative three. Or that five to the negative three power, five to the negative three power is equal to one over 125. And we can verify that this has formatted the right way. Five to the negative three power is one over 125. The exact same truth about the universe just in different forms. Logarithmic form and exponential form. So let me check my answer, make sure I got it right. And I did.
