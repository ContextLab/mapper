We're told given G of X is equal to 10 of X minus 3 pi over 2 plus 6, find a G inverse of X. And they want us to type that in here. And then they also want us to figure out what is the domain of G inverse of X. So I've got my little scratch pad here to try to work that through. So let's figure out what G inverse of X is. This is G of X. So G inverse of X, I'm essentially, let me just write this as G of X right over here. G of X is equal to tangent of X minus 3 pi over 2 plus 6. So G inverse of X, I essentially can swap, I can replace the X with the G inverse of X and replace the G of X with an X. And then solve for G inverse of X. So I could write that X is equal to tangent of G inverse of X minus 3 pi over 2 plus 6. So let's just solve for G inverse of X. And I actually encourage you to pause this video and try to work through this out, or work it out on your own. So let's subtract 6 from both sides to at least get rid of this 6 here. And so I'm left with X minus 6 is equal to the tangent of G inverse of X minus 3 pi over 2. Now let's take the inverse tangent of both sides of this equation. So the inverse tangent of the left-hand side is the inverse tangent of X minus 6. And on the right-hand side, the inverse tangent of tangent, if we restrict the domain in the proper way, and we'll talk about that in a little bit, is just going to be what the input into the tangent function is. So if you restrict the domain in the right way, the inverse tangent of the tangent of something, of say theta, is just going to be equal to theta. Because again, if we restrict the domain, if we restrict what the possible values of theta are in the right way. So let's just assume that we're doing that. And so the inverse tangent of the tan of this is going to be just this stuff right over here. It's just going to be that. It's going to be G inverse of X minus 3 pi over 2. And now we're in the home stretch. To solve for G inverse of X, we could just add 3 pi over 2 to both sides. So we get, and actually let me just swap both sides, we get G inverse of X is equal to the inverse tangent of X minus 6. And then we're adding 3 pi over 2 to both sides. So this side is now on this side. So plus 3 pi over 2. Plus 3 pi over 2. So let me actually type that in. Let me see if I can remember it. Because I'm about to lose this on my screen. So inverse tangent of X minus 6 plus 3 pi over 2. So let me write that down. So let me type this. So G inverse of X is going to be the inverse tangent. So I could write it like this. The inverse tangent of X minus 6. And yes, it interpreted it correctly. Inverse tangent. You can view that as arc tangent of X minus 6 plus 3 pi over 2. And it did interpret it correctly. But then we have to think about what is the domain of G inverse? What is the domain of G inverse of X? Let's think about this a little bit more. The domain of G inverse of X. So let's just think about what tangent is doing. So the tangent function, if we imagine a unit circle. If we imagine a unit circle. So that's a unit circle right over there. I guess we can imagine it to be a unit circle. My pen tool is acting up a little bit as putting these little gaps and things. But I think we can power through that. So let's just say for the sake of argument that that's a unit circle. That's the X axis and that's the Y axis. If you form an angle theta, if you form some angle theta right over here. The tangent of theta is essentially the slope of this terminal ray of the angle. Or the, I guess you could call it the terminal ray of the angle. The angle is formed by that ray and this ray along the positive X axis. So the tangent of theta is the slope right over there. Is the slope right over there. And you can get a tangent of any theta except for a few. So you can find the tangent of that. You can find the slope there. You can find the slope there. You can also find the slope there. You can find the slope there. But the place where you can't find the slope is when this ray goes straight up. Is when this ray goes straight up or this ray goes straight down. Those are the cases where you can't find the slope. There the slope you could say is approaching positive or negative infinity. So the domain of tangent. So tangent domain. So the domain is essentially all real numbers. All reals. Except multiples of pi over, I guess you could say pi over 2 plus multiples of pi. Except pi over 2 plus multiples of pi. Where K could be any integer. So you could also be subtracting pi. Because if you have pi over 2, if you add pi you go straight down here. You add another pi you go up there. If you subtract pi you go down here. And subtract another pi you go over there. So this is the domain. But given this domain you can get any real number. So the range here is all reals. Because you can get any slope here. You can increase theta if you want a really high slope. Decrease theta if you want a really negative slope right over there. So you can really get to anything. Now when you're talking about the inverse tangent. When you're talking about the inverse tangent. By convention you're going to, well to make tangent invertible. So that you don't have multiple elements of your domain. All mapping to the same element of the range. Because for example, this angle right over here. Has the exact same slope as this angle. Right over here. Right over here. And so if you have two thetas mapping to the same tangent. Then that's not, if you don't restrict your domain. So that you only have one of them. It's not going to be invertible. And so the convention. The convention is that to make tangent invertible. You restrict it's domain. So you restrict the domain. Restrict the domain. To the interval from negative pi over two. To pi over two. In order to construct the inverse tangent. So the inverse tangent. You can input any real number into it. So the inverse tangent's domain. Domain. This is just a convention. They could have restricted tangent's domains. As long as for any theta. There's only one theta in that domain. That maps to a specific element of the range. But the convention is. Well inverse tangent. Or the convention is to restrict tangent's domain. Between negative pi over two. And pi over two. So invert tangent's domain is all reals. All reals. But it's range is restricted. It's range. And this is by convention. It's going to be between negative pi over two. And pi over two. And not including. And not including them. So let's go back to our original question right over here. What is the domain of G inverse? So let's look at our. The domain of G inverse. Well G inverse. The domain of this. I could put any real number in here. Any real number here. Now what this is going to pop out. Is going to be something between negative pi over two. And pi over two. But they're not asking us the range of G inverse. Actually would have been a more interesting question. They're asking us what's the domain of G inverse. And I could put in any real number right here for X. So let's put that in here. So the domain of G inverse of X. It's negative infinity to infinity. But actually just for fun. And let's just verify that we got the question right. And we did. But just for fun. Actually I am curious. Let's think about what the range of G inverse is. So the range of this thing right over here is going to be between negative pi over two to pi over two. That's for this part right over here. And then we're going to add three pi over twos to it. So the range for the entire function. So the range for this thing. The range is going to be what the low end, if we add three pi over two to this. This is going to give us two pi over two. Which is just going to be. So three pi over two minus pi over two is going to be two pi over two. Which is just pi. Just pi. All the way to three pi over two plus another pi over two. It's going to be four pi's over two. Or two pi. Or two pi. So the range of G inverse of X is pi to two pi. And it's an open interval. It doesn't include the boundaries. But it's domain. You could put any value for X here. And it will be defined.
