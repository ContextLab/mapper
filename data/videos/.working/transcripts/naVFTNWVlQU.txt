Use the cards below to create a list of steps in order that we'll solve the following equation. Three times x plus six squared is equal to 75. And I encourage you to pause this video now and try to figure it out on your own. Figure out which of these steps and in what order you would do to solve for x here. So I'm assuming you've given it a go. So let's try to work through it together. And first let me just rewrite the equation. So we have three times the quantity x plus six squared is equal to 75. So what I want to do is I want to isolate the x plus six squared on the left hand side. Or another way of thinking about it, I don't want this three here anymore. So how would I get rid of that three? Well I could divide the left hand side by three. But if I do that to only one side of the equation, it won't be equal anymore. These two things in yellow were equal to each other. If I want the equalities to hold anything that I do to the left hand side, I have to do to the right hand side. So let me divide that by three as well. And so on the left hand side, I am left with x plus six squared is equal to 75 divided by three. So 75 divided by three is 25. Now if I told you that something squared, so actually let me just pick out the first one I did. I divided both sides by three. So that was my first step there. Let me write that in a darker color. So that was my first step right over there. Now let's think about what we're doing. We're saying that something squared, we're saying that something squared is equal to 25. So this something could be the positive or negative square root of 25. So let's take the, so we could write this as x plus six is equal to the plus or minus square root of 25. So I'm essentially taking the positive and negative square root of both sides. So let's see, this looks like this step. I took the square root of both sides. That's step number two. And so let me just rewrite this. This is the same thing as x plus six is equal to plus or minus five. And now I wanna just have an x on the left hand side. I wanna solve for x. That's the goal from the beginning. So I would like to get rid of this six. Well the easiest way to do that is to subtract six from the left hand side. But just like before, I can't just do it from one side of an equation. Then the equality wouldn't be true. We're literally saying that x plus six is equal to plus or minus five. So x plus six minus six is going to be equal to plus or minus five minus six. Or actually let me write it this way. So let me subtract six from both sides. On the left hand side, I'm left with an x. And on the right hand side, I have, and I could write it this way, negative six. What do we do with that green color? I have negative six plus or minus plus or minus five. So what are the possible values of x? Or actually, I keep forgetting. We don't have to actually give the value for x. We just have to say what steps we did. So then let's see, after we took the square root of both sides, we then subtracted six from both sides. So that was step three right over there. Then that got us to essentially the two possible x's that would satisfy this equation right over here. And just for fun, let's actually solve it all the way. So if we solve it all the way, we get to, so x is equal to negative six plus five is negative one. Or x is equal to negative six minus five is negative 11. And you could verify, but that both of these work. If you put either of them in here, if you put negative one here, you get negative one plus six squared is five squared. If you put negative 11 here, it's negative 11 plus six is negative five squared. Obviously either plus or minus five squared is going to be 25, 25 times three is 75. So these are our three steps. We divided both sides by three, subtracted, then we took the square root of both sides, then we subtracted six from both sides, and then we were essentially done. So let's input those steps. So the first thing we did, we divide both sides by three. That's the first thing we did. Then we took the square root of both sides, and then we subtracted six from both sides. We got it right.
