We're told a bakery bakes 144 cookies and packs them equally into nine boxes. Cindy buys one of the cookie boxes and eats five cookies. How many cookies are left in Cindy's box? Pause this video, have a go at that before we do this together. All right, so my brain wants to first figure out how many are going to be in each box. And then I'm gonna take away the five cookies that Cindy has eaten and then we know how many are left. So to figure out how many are in each box, we'd wanna take the total number of boxes, 144, and then it's divided equally into nine boxes. So if we divide this by nine, then we know how much is in each box. So let me write that, number in each box. So we'd wanna do that first. And once we figure out the number in each box, that would also be the amount that Cindy gets when she buys one of the boxes. And then she eats five cookies. So then eats five cookies. So we'd subtract five from that and we would know how many cookies are left in Cindy's box. So let's first calculate what 144 divided by nine is. And we'll do a little bit of, I'll call it light long division here. So nine goes into 144, 144. 144, it doesn't go into one, but it does go into 14. It goes into 14, let me just do another color, one time. One times nine is nine. You can subtract. 14 minus nine is five. Bring down that four. Nine goes into 54 six times exactly. Six times nine is 54 and we have no remainder. So it goes exactly 16 times. So 144 divided by nine, this is 16. So we're left with 16 minus five. So Cindy had 16 cookies in her box. She eats five of them. So what is she left with? Well, 16 minus five is equal to 11. Cindy's left with 11 cookies.
