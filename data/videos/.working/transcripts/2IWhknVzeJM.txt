Ify is building a tree tower, which is a tower built on top of a tree. The tree is currently five meters tall, and Ify has found, I don't know if it's Ify or Ify, and Ify has found it is growing by 0.1 meters a month, or a tenth of a meter a month. The tower is currently two meters tall, so this tower that sits on top of the tree is two meters tall currently, and Ify or Ify adds to it at about 0.2 meters a month. So I guess he or she, I don't know if he, well, let's just say he, is continuously building this tower on this continuously growing tree, which is fascinating. All right. The function a of m returns the tree's height in meters and months from now. Fascinating. The function b of m returns the tower's height in meters and months from now. So this is the tree's height, a of m is the tree's height, b of m is the tower's height. Find the formula of the two functions. So a of m, so they tell us the tree is currently five meters tall, so it's gonna be five meters tall right at the start, and then every month it is growing by 0.1 meters. So it's going to be five plus 0.1 times m, and this m here, this is not meters, this is actually the months. Remember, m is the number of months. So after zero months, which is right now, this is just going to be five. After one month, it's going to be 5.1. After two months, it's gonna be 5.2, which is exactly what we want. All right, now let's think about the tower. So the formula for b of m, so the tower is currently two meters tall, so it's currently two meters tall, and it grows at 2 tenths of a meter per month. So 2 tenths times the number of months, and once again, this m right over here is not meters. I'm not writing the units here, we're just assuming that whatever this returns is in meters. This m right over here is the number of months that pass by, the number of months from now. All right, the function c of m returns the vertical distance between the ground and the top end of the tower. That makes sense, that would be from the bottom of the tree to the top of the tower. Write the formula c of m in terms of a of m and b of m. Well, the total height is going to be the height of the tree, which is a of m, plus the height of the tower, plus b of m, plus b of m. That's what c of m is gonna be. And then they say write the formula of c of m in terms of m. Well, we just need to add these two functions. If we add 5 plus 0.1 m to 2 plus 0.2 m, that's going to be, let's see, we could add 5 plus 2, and we're gonna get 7 plus, and if I have 0.1 m and I add another 0.2 m, that's gonna be 0.3 m. 0.3 m. And we are done. We got it right.
