What we're going to do in this video is add 48,029 to 233,930 and like always, pause this video and I really encourage you to try to figure it out on your own and let's see if we get the same answer and if we don't, why? Alright, so the way I'm gonna tackle this, I assume that you've had a go at it, I'm gonna take the larger number, I'm gonna write it on top, I'm really doing the standard method, there's multiple ways where you can add multi-digit numbers but what I'm gonna do is really the most typical method and then I'm gonna write the smaller number below it but I'm gonna match up the place value. So I'm gonna write the ones place in the same column as the ones place on the top number. So this is the 10,000ths place, so 48,029. So nine ones, zero ones, two tens, three tens, so on and so forth and now I am ready to add. So let's start in the ones place and if I'm adding numbers, it's always a good idea to start in the ones place. Zero ones plus nine ones is nine ones and then I can go into the tens place. Three tens plus two tens is five tens, this is going well. Alright, then I go to the hundreds place, nine hundreds plus zero hundreds, well that's just gonna be nine hundreds, so far so good. Alright, now something interesting is gonna happen in the thousands place. Three thousands plus eight thousands, well that would be 11,000ths. But we can rewrite 11,000ths as 1,000 and 110,000. Sometimes you might see this described as carrying the one, three plus eight is 11 where you carry the one but all you're really doing is regrouping. Three plus 3,000 plus 8,000 is 11,000. We write the 1,000 here and then you write the 10,000 right over there in the 10,000 place. And now, so we have one 10,000 plus three 10,000 plus four 10,000ths, so one plus three plus four, that's eight 10,000ths or 80,000. And then last but not least, we have these 200,000s right over there and we're done. 281,959, did you get the same answer?
