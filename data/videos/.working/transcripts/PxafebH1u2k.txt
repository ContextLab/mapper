What we wanna do in this video is figure out what two divided by 0.4 is, or two divided by 4 tenths. So why don't you pause this video and try to figure out what it is, and it's a little bit of a hint. Think about two on the number line, and think about how many jumps of 4 tenths do you have to make starting at zero to get to two to figure out what two divided by 4 tenths is. All right, now let's do it together. And as I mentioned in my hint, let's just think about how many jumps of 4 tenths we have to make to go from zero to two. And on this number line, each of these, this is a tenth right over here, because we can see there's 10 equal spaces between zero and one. So let's take some jumps of 4 tenths. So if we start at zero, we can make, let's see, this is 1 tenth, 2 tenths, 3 tenths, 4 tenths. That's one jump, I'll number that. And then we can make our next jump of 1, 2, 3, 4 tenths. It gets us right over there, that's two jumps. Then our next jump will take us right over there. So once again, I'm just making equal jumps of 4 tenths. Then my next jump will take us 1, 2, 3, 4 tenths further. So that gets us right over there. We've taken four jumps. And then it looks like our fifth jump gets us there. 1, 2, 3, 4 tenths, yep. Our fifth jump gets us exactly 2, 2. So we've taken five jumps of 4 tenths to go from zero to 2. Or another way to think about it is, if you were to divide two into equal chunks of 4 tenths, you could divide into five equal chunks of 4 tenths. Or you can make five equal jumps to go from, five equal jumps of 4 tenths to go from zero to 2.
