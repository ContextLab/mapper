We're told that the quadratic expressions, m squared minus four m minus 45, and six m squared minus 150, share a common binomial factor. What binomial factor do they share? And like always, pause the video and see if you can work through this. All right, now let's work through this together. And the way I'm gonna do this, I'm just gonna try to factor both of them into the product of binomials and maybe some other things and see if we have any common binomial factors. So first, let's focus on m squared minus four m minus 45. So let me write it over here. m squared minus four m minus 45. So when you're factoring a quadratic expression like this, where the coefficient on the, in this case, m squared term on the second degree term is one, we could factor it as being equal to m plus a times m plus b, where a plus b is going to be equal to this coefficient right over here, and a times b is going to be equal to this coefficient right over here. So let's be clear. So a, we just have another color. So a plus b needs to be equal to negative four. A plus b needs to be equal to negative four. And then a times b needs to be equal to negative 45. a times b is equal to negative 45. Now I like to focus on the a times b and think about, well, what could a and b be to get to negative 45? Well, if I'm taking the product of two things and if the product is negative, that means that they're going to have different signs. And if when we add them, we get a negative number, that means that the negative one has a larger, has a larger magnitude. So let's think about this a little bit. So a times b is equal to negative 45. So this could be, let's try some values out. So one and 45, those are too far apart. Let's see, three and 15, those still seem pretty far apart. Let's see, it looks like five and nine seem interesting. So if we say five times, if we were to say five times negative nine, that indeed is equal to negative 45. And five plus negative nine is indeed equal to negative four. So a could be equal to five and b could be equal to negative nine. And so if we were to factor this, this is going to be m plus five times m, I could say m plus negative nine, but I'll just write m minus nine. So just like that, I've been able to factor, I've been able to factor this first quadratic expression right over there as a product of two binomials. So now let's try to factor the other quadratic expression. Let's try to factor six m squared minus 150. And let's see, the first thing I might wanna do is both six, both six m squared and 150, they're both divisible by six. So let me write it this way. I could write it as six, actually I'll just write six m squared minus six times, let's see, six goes into 150 25 times. So all I did is I rewrote this and I just really, I just wrote 150 as six times 25. And now you can clearly see that we can factor out a six. You can view this as undistributing the six. So this is the same thing as six times m squared minus 25, which we recognize this is a difference of squares. So it's all gonna be six times m plus five times m minus five. And so we've factored this out as a product of binomials and a constant factor here, six. And so what is their shared common, what is their common binomial factor that they share? Well you see when we factored out, they both have, they both have an m plus five. So m plus five, m plus five is the binomial factor that they share.
