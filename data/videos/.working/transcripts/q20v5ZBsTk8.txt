Ocean sunfishes are well known for rapidly gaining a lot of weight on a diet based on jellyfish. The relationship between the elapsed time t in days since an ocean sunfish is born and its mass, m of t, in milligrams is modeled by the following function. Alright, complete the following sentence about the daily percent change in the mass of the sunfish. Every day there is a blank percent addition or removal from the mass of the sunfish. So one thing that we know from, almost from the get go, we know that the sunfish gains weight. And we also see that as t grows, as t grows the exponent here is going to grow. And if you grow an exponent on something that is larger than one, m of t is going to grow. So I already know it's going to be about addition to the mass of the sunfish. But let's think about how much is added every day. Well, let's think about it. Well, let's see if we can rewrite this. This is, I'm gonna just focus on the right hand side of this expression. So 1.35 to the t over six plus five, that's the same thing as 1.35 to the fifth power times 1.35 to the t over sixth power. And that's going to be equal to 1.35 to the fifth power times 1.35. And I can separate this t over six as 1 six times t. So 1.35 to the 1 sixth power. And then that being raised to the teeth, to the teeth power. So let's think about it. Every day as t increases by one, now we can say that we're gonna take the previous day's, the previous day's mass and multiply it by this common ratio. The common ratio here isn't, the way I've written it, isn't 1.35, it's 1.35 to the 1 sixth power. Let me draw a little table here to make that really, really clear. And all of that algebraic manipulation I just did, it's just so I could simplify this so I have some common ratio to the teeth power. So t and m of t. So based on how I've just written it, when t is zero, well if t is zero, this is one. So then we just have our initial, our initial mass is going to be 1.35 to the fifth power. And then when t is equal to one, when t is equal to one, it's gonna be our initial mass, 1.35 to the fifth power times our common ratio. Times 1.35 to the 1 sixth power. When t equals two, we're just gonna multiply what we had at t equals one, and we're just going to multiply that times 1.35 to the 1 sixth again. And so every day, well let me get, every day we are growing, every day we are growing by our common ratio, 1.35 to the 1 sixth power. Actually let me get a calculator out, we're allowed to use calculators in this exercise. So 1.35 to the, to the, open parentheses, one divided by six, close parentheses, power, is equal to 1.05, I'll say 1.051 approximately. So this is approximately 1.051. So we could say this is approximately 1.35 times 1.051 to the tth power. So every day we are growing by a factor of 1.051. Well growing by a factor of 1.051 means that you're adding a little bit more than 5%. You're adding 0.51 every day of your mass, so that's, you're adding 5.1%. And if you're rounding to the nearest percent, we would say there's a 5% addition to the mass of the sunfish every day.
