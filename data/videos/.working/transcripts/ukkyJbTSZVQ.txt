Hi, everyone. Sal Khan here, and I'm here with Gumi Kim, who's the director of product management at Google in account security. And my question for you, Gumi, is everyone's always talking about account security. Why should I or the folks watching care? Yes. So it sounds like a technical term, but it's actually something that affects us every day. Think of all of the online accounts that you use, whether that's your bank or Google or any other service. Well, any of those accounts actually hold all of your personal information. And like a house, you want it to protect that personal information that you care about. There's always going to be things like bugs and rats and thieves that try to come in. And so you want to make sure that they don't. And what's going to happen? Like, if somehow someone gets into my account, what's the worst that they can do? Well, I mean, just taking a Google account, for example, like not only can they take your personal information like your photos or information you're sending in Gmail, you know, they could also get access to all of your other online accounts. As you know, you know, your Gmail account is actually a key to getting into your bank, your social media accounts, your e-commerce, because once you compromise, for example, the Gmail account, then I can get into all of those other accounts as well. Yeah, people can steal money from you. They can misrepresent you. They can see all your private information. It can get to be pretty scary. So I think this is something people should pay attention to.
