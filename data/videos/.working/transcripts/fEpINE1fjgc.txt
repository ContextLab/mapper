Rectangle ABCD is graphed in the coordinate plane. The following are the vertices of the rectangle, and they give us the labels for the vertices as well. Given these coordinates, what is the length of side AD of this rectangle? So let's just plot it. That's one way that we could tackle it. So let's, let me see, all of these are actually in the first coordinate, so I can focus on the first coordinate. So let's say that's my y-axis. That's my y-axis, and let me draw my x-axis. My x-axis. And actually, I want to really focus in on the points A and D, because we just need to find the length of the side from point A to point D. So point A, let me just do another color. So point A is at x equals 7, y is equal to 1. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So that's x equals 7. y is equal to 1. y is equal to 1. So that is point A right over there. Point A, let me label it. Point A. And then where's point D? Point D has the exact same x-coordinate, but its y-coordinate is a little bit higher. Its y-coordinate is 6. It's actually 5 higher. So point D is at x equals 7, y is equal to 6. So y is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So that's y is equal to 6. And so we can draw the point. It is going to be right over here. This is point D. And we can actually connect them with a line, if we like, to show that this is a side of a rectangle. Let me draw that. I can just draw this like this. And there you have it. I haven't even drawn the whole rectangle yet, but just by plotting these two points, we can think about how long side AD is. We can see, look, the x doesn't change going from A to D, but we do increase in the y direction by 5. We go from y is equal to 1 to y is equal to 5 to y is equal to 6. So our change in y is equal to 5. So what's the length of this line? Well, it's going to be 5. It's going to be 5 whatever the units are. So that's the length of side AD. It's going to be equal to 5. We went from the point 7, 1 to the point 7, 6. Now, they said that this was a rectangle. Now, just for satisfaction, we can draw the entire rectangle. We have the point B. That is that x equals 5, y is equal to 1. So let me draw that. And I'm just doing this just for fun now at this point. We're done with the problem. So x equals 5, y equals 1. That's right over here. That's point B. Let me write B. That's the point 5, 1. And then we have the point C. I'll do this in another color. The point C is that x equals 5, y equals 6. x equals 5, y equals 6. Point C is right over here. Point C is the point x equals 5, y is equal 6. And then we can connect all the dots if we like and clearly see that it is a rectangle. So I could connect those. I could connect these two. And then I could connect these two. And then we see that we indeed have a rectangle. But we answered it a while ago that the length of side ad is equal to 5. If we cared about the other sides, the length of ba, well, this is 2. We just, a difference of 2 along the x direction, the horizontal direction, difference of 2 along the x direction, difference of 5 in the y direction. We go from y equals 1 to y equals 6. So there you have it. We are actually able to figure out all of the dimensions of this rectangle.
