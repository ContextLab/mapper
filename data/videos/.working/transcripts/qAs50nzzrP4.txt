Find the area of the trapezoid. So the area of a trapezoid, I'll say that a, and I'll put a little small t here so that we're finding the area of the trapezoid. The easiest way to think about it is it is the average of the bases times the height. So the average of the bases is 15 plus 11 divided by 2. Sometimes you'll see in formulas this is base one, this is base two, this is base one, base two. A trapezoid obviously has two parallel bases. So it's the average of the bases, 15 plus 11 over two, times the height. And the height here is four centimeters, times four. And the units here are in centimeters, the units here are in centimeters, so when you multiply it, you're going to get centimeters squared, but let's actually evaluate it. So 15 plus 11 is 36. So this is going to be 36, or sorry, it's 26. 15 plus 11 is 26 divided by two is 13. And then you have 13 times four, times four, which is equal to 40 plus 12, it's 52, and then square centimeters. And we're done, we found the area of the trapezoid. And if you're wondering why does this thing here make sense? And one way to think about it is, imagine you were to take the area of just using this base. So if you were to look at the rectangle that has this base and that height, and you would have this area that I'm showing you in white, if I just took 11 times four, you would get this area right over there. So 11 times four would be this area right over here. And if I took 15 times four, I would get this entire rectangle. I would get this entire rectangle. So 15 times four would be the entire rectangle. So it would even include some of this area that is not included in the trapezoid. And if you look at this, and it's not a rigorous proof, but it's giving you the intuition why this is the formula, the actual area of the trapezoid is exactly in between these two areas. It's in between this white area and this larger, the area of the larger rectangle. And you could see that because these lines divide the kind of the difference between the two areas, it divides them in two. So the area of the trapezoid is actually if you average these two numbers. If you add them together and you divide by two, which is the same thing as four times the average of the bases, 11 plus 15 over two. Either way, this is the answer, 52 centimeters squared.
