So we have g of x being defined as the log of three x when zero is less than x is less than three and four minus x times the log of nine when x is greater than or equal to three. So based on this definition of g of x, we want to find the limit of g of x as x approaches three. And once again, this three is right at the interface between these two clauses. Or these two cases. We go to this first case when x is between zero and three, when it's greater than zero and less than three, and then at three, we hit this case. So in order to find the limit, we want to find the limit from the left-hand side, which will have us dealing with this situation, because if we're less than three, we're in this clause. And we also want to find the limit from the right-hand side, which would put us in this clause right over here. And then if both of those limits exist and if they are the same, then that is going to be the limit of this. So let's do that. So let me first go from the left-hand side. So the limit as x approaches three from values less than three, so we're going to approach from the left, of g of x. Well, this is equivalent to saying this is the limit as x approaches three from the negative side. When x is less than three, which is what's happening here, we're approaching three from the left, we're in this clause right over here. So we're going to be operating right over there. That is what g of x is when we are less than three. So log of three x. And since this function right over here is defined and continuous over the interval we care about, it's defined and continuous for all x's greater than zero, well, we can just substitute three in here to see what it would be approaching. So this would be equal log of three times three or logarithm of nine. And once again, when people just write log here without writing the base, it's implied that we're dealing that it is 10 right over here. So this is log base 10. It's just a good thing to know that sometimes gets missed a little bit. All right, now let's think about the other case. Let's think about the situation where we are approaching three from the right-hand side, and we're going to be looking at what are the values greater than three? Well, we are now going to be in this scenario right over there. So this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches three from the positive direction, from the right-hand side of, well, g of x is in this clause when we are greater than three. So four minus x times log of nine. And this looks like some type of a logarithm expression at first until you realize that log of nine is just a constant. Log base 10 of nine, it's going to be some number close to one. This is just, this expression would actually define a line. For x greater than or equal to three, g of x is just a line, even though it looks a little bit complicated. And so this is actually defined for all real numbers. And so it's continuous for any x that you put into it. So to find this limit, to think about what is this expression approaching as we approach three from the positive direction, well, we can just evaluate it at three. So it's going to be four minus three times log of nine. Well, that's just one. So that's equal to log base 10 of nine. So the limit from the left equals the limit from the right. They're both log nine. So the answer here is log, log of nine. And we are done.
