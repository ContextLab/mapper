If 3 times a number is equal to 3 halves, what is the number? So let's just say that our number, that this unknown number, let's just call that x. So we could say 3 times our number x is equal to 3 halves. So now we just have to solve for x. And so if we want to isolate an x here on the left hand side, the most obvious thing to do is, well, it's 3 times x. If we divide by 3, we're going to be left with just an x. But we can't just do that to one side of the equation. If we want to maintain this equality, we have to do it to both sides. So you divide both sides by 3. And we are going to be left with x is equal to 3 halves divided by 3. That's the same thing as 3 halves times 1 third, 3 halves times 1 over 3, which is going to be equal to 1 half. So x is equal to 1 half. And you can verify that 3 times 1 half is equal to 3 halves.
