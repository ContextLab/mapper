Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning more about Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution. Article 6 is, as we'll soon see, kind of a constitutional grab bag. It covers debts, religious tests for office, and it establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. To learn more about what binds these diverse ideas together, I sought out the help of two experts. Kermit Roosevelt is a professor of law specializing in constitutional law and conflict of laws at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. And Michael Ramsey is professor of law and director of international and comparative law programs at the University of San Diego School of Law. So let's start out talking about the debts portion of Article 6. Professor Roosevelt, why were the framers so interested in debt? What was the historical context that led them to explicitly address debt in Article 6? Well, debt is important generally because nations often need to borrow money. And specifically with the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. government had been borrowing money to pay for the Revolutionary War. So there was a question, we're moving from a sort of loose Confederation, almost like a treaty between nations, under the Articles of Confederation, to a single unitary country with a stronger national government under the Constitution. And there's a question, is it still the same country? Will the new United States pay the debts of the old United States? Now, there's a general principle of international law that a successor government undertakes the obligations of the predecessor. So you wouldn't necessarily think this would be a problem, but I think they were particularly concerned because the idea of a republic was a somewhat new one, at least in the 18th century, somewhat unusual one. And the change of a Republican government might cause some worries in Europe where this money was owed. So I think they just wanted to reassure all of the creditors that even if they were changing their method of government, that that wasn't going to affect any of the debts. What might have happened had they decided not to pay those debts? If they decided not to pay the debts, then other countries would probably have been much less willing to lend money to the new United States because they might have thought, well, you know, another change in government could occur. There was substantial question throughout the world whether the United States would be able to survive in the face of all the challenges that they had after gaining their independence. So in order to make it seem that the United States was a country that could be trusted, a country that could be expected to stick around and not collapse into chaos or revert to colonial status, one of the most important things for them was to show that the debts would be honored because a failure to honor debts would suggest that the country did not in fact have true sovereignty and was not prepared to be a actor on the international stage that could be trusted. Another interesting thing to contrast this to is the treatment of debts after the Civil War, where of course the United States, the federal government paid its own debts, but there's a provision in the 14th Amendment explicitly repudiating the Confederate debt. So if you loaned money to the Confederate States of America, you're never getting that back because we didn't treat that as a valid government that would be continued going forward. Another thing that it illustrates is that the Constitution in some respects was a visionary document that was concerned with the long-term future of the United States, but in other respects, it responded to very immediate practical problems that the framers faced in their day. They were thinking about not just the future of the country for the ages, and they were thinking about that, but they weren't thinking just about that. They were also thinking about reassuring France with respect to the debts that existed right at that moment. So there's a lot going on in Article 6, and specifically it talks about the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. So what's important about that statement? What's important about that is that it means the Constitution is our highest law. It prevails over any other kind of law in a conflict. So one thing that that means is the Constitution is supreme over state law, and then the Constitution actually goes on to talk about that a little bit more. But it also means the Constitution is supreme over federal law. So everyone is bound by the Constitution. The states can't go against it, Congress can't go past it, the president can't violate constitutional restrictions. The Constitution is really the last word. It's the pinnacle or the keystone of the arch of American democracy. And that's why we can say that things are unconstitutional, that laws are unconstitutional, and therefore invalid. And most importantly, it's why the Supreme Court can say that laws are unconstitutional and invalid. It creates a superior law that limits the laws that can be passed by the other parts of the government. It creates a hierarchy of laws, and in doing so, it assures that we have a single set of rules that applies to all the states and to the federal government, and it can't be changed except by an amendment, which is relatively difficult to do. There's a procedure in the Constitution for how you can amend the Constitution, but until amended, the Constitution as written is our superior law. And that was different from the way that the rules, the framers were used to under the English system, where they didn't have a written Constitution, and an unwritten Constitution, that Constitution was subject to change by Parliament. So has this supremacy of the Constitution been tested over time? There haven't been a lot of claims that the Constitution is not supreme. So generally speaking, everyone gives at least lip service to this idea. What's been tested is more the question of who gets to decide what the Constitution means and when something conflicts with it. So if you want the Constitution and federal law to be supreme, probably you would wanna have someone in the federal government deciding when there's a conflict, say with state law. And the forms that resistance has taken over the years are more states saying not we can go against the Constitution, we're above the Constitution, but states saying we don't think what we're doing violates the Constitution, right? And you, the Supreme Court, you think it does, but you're wrong. In the 19th century, just before the Civil War, the Supreme Court decided in the Dred Scott case that African Americans could not be citizens to the United States, even if they were freed slaves. And President Lincoln believed that that was wrong. He said that there was nothing in the Constitution that denied that the ability of them to be citizens. And he said that the Supreme Court had misinterpreted the Constitution, and he would not accept the Supreme Court's ruling in that regard. Later in the 20th century, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution barred segregation, particularly in schools, in the Brown v. Board of Education case. But many Southern governors and other institutions throughout the South thought that the Supreme Court had gotten that one wrong, and they refused to abide by what the Supreme Court had said the Constitution means. What they said was not the Constitution doesn't bind us, but we know what the Constitution means better than you, Supreme Court. You're wrong, you're making this up. It's political, it's not judging. Another thing that Article 6 talks about is religious tests. Why were the framers so interested in preventing religious tests in government? What sort of historical evils were they trying to prevent? So this is connected to the basic idea of the separation of church and state. And you separate church and state, really, to protect both of those things. So you wanna protect religion from being corrupted by political considerations, but you also wanna protect your political system from being a battleground between rival religions. So where this comes from is that in England, they had had a series of what they called test acts. And what the test acts did was it required for people to be eligible for government offices, that people had to be members of the Church of England, and that other religious groups, they were barred by the test acts from holding government office. So actually, many of those minority religions, many adherents of those, ended up coming to the American colonies to gain some measure of religious freedom. The pilgrims were an example of that. There was a Catholic colony in Maryland. And just generally speaking, many of the people, many of the colonists who came over were people who were not part of the main established church in England. And so you can see why they would not wanna have something like the test acts, and they wanted to make clear that in the new national government, that any religion or no religion would be allowed for government office holders. Do you think it's true that we don't have religious tests or oaths in the United States? How about the practice of swearing on a Bible during the presidential inauguration? Well, the practice of swearing on a Bible is very interesting, as is the fact that when the president recites the oath of office, every president, going back to George Washington, has added on to the end of it, so help me God. There's actually an oath in the constitution, the president has to swear to preserve, protect and defend the constitution. But the constitution doesn't say, so help me God, the president's just add that on, on their own. And actually that sort of illustrates the way in which the constitution treats religion, which is it can't be part of government in an official sense. But we know that members of government are also people and they have religious beliefs that are important to them. And we don't demand that they exclude religion from their lives, we just demand that it be separated from government authority. So you can swear on a Bible if you want to, you don't have to, you can swear on some other religious book. We had a member of Congress take an oath of office on a Quran. So individual government officials are allowed to include religion in so far as it's about them personally. What you think is appropriate to mark this occasion, what solemnifies this oath for you, you can do that. But we can't require it and they can't make the exercise of their power religious in nature. So you can't, as a government official, exercise your power on religious grounds. Something that strikes me about article six is that it addresses so many different things. Do you have a sense of why debts and constitutional supremacy and religious tests are all in one article? Article six, as you said, is a little bit of a grab bag. It's not entirely clear how these different pieces of article six relate to each other. And I think they were just things that the framers wanted in the constitution and didn't know for sure where else to put them. I'm not exactly sure why the debts are there. If I had to say something about article six, it's sort of the glue that holds the constitutional architecture together. So maybe the debts are in there to explain the continuity between the US government under the Articles of Confederation and the US government under the constitution. Then the Supremacy Clause explains how all of the different parts of the federal system are supposed to fit together. And what the Supremacy Clause is saying is the constitution is above all of them. The constitution connects them all. Everyone has to abide by the constitution. And it tells you the constitution is the highest law, then you've got federal law, and then below that is state law, so that if there's a conflict between federal law and state law, the federal law is gonna win. And then the last part of article six is sort of doing the same thing. Because what holds a country together? What binds people into a single people? In a lot of countries, at the time of the founding, it was religion, right? Religion was the glue that held the society together. And if you weren't a member of that religion, you were an outsider, you were a second class citizen, you would be shunned and not given equal rights in some ways. The last clause of article six says something sort of similar about America, except it explicitly says it's not religion that binds us together, right? No religious test can be required. But you do have to take an oath, what do you have to pledge to support? You have to pledge to support the constitution. So there again, it's telling you the constitution is what we all have in common. That's what makes us Americans. That really is the glue that binds our society together. So we've learned that article six is, as Professor Roosevelt put it, the glue that binds the country together. In assuming the debts from the era of the Articles of Confederation, article six established the continuity of US government. It also placed the constitution, not religion, as the supreme law of the United States.
