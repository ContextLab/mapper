We might get into some teacher tools for BTS for back to school, but maybe it's a little too early for that. So we might save that for our next session and then we'll finish up. Okay. So to get started and to get thinking about summer, we know that summer is a challenging time for students and teachers alike, except for the vacation part, of course. But there's this thing that we all know about that summer slide that shows that students can lose up to a month of learning over summer. I remember my time in the classroom and summer when students came back during after summer, it was like, okay, what happened here? There are challenges with even our low income students are disproportionately affected. Some of the research is showing that they're losing up to two months of even reading skills over summer. We also have concerns about students having access to quality educational materials and there's even social emotional impact there as well. So some of that data on the slide there, as you're thinking about your own students and your own classrooms, what are some summer learning challenges that might be top of mind for you? Go ahead and add that to the chat. If you have something that immediately comes to mind, maybe it's something that you saw on that slide already. What are some of those challenges that you face that you think your students face as well? Okay, so one of the things not practicing writing because it's not a preferred activity. Okay, well, the news is I might have a resource for you. Anything else? Yeah, entertaining them without electronic devices. Okay. Feels like extra work for the summer out of sight out of mind. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so a lot of different concerns there and a lot of valid concerns there. Luckily, there is Khan Academy and we are here to help and we do have some components that can be exciting for students and hopefully help them feel more engaged on things that they can do to be motivated in the summer to work on some of those skills and areas where they might need to work in. And so one of the things that I want to talk with you today about is our summer learning guide and I'm going to put this document into the chat. I will also make sure that it is sent out in the follow up email as well. And let me grab that for you right now. I'm just adding it to the chat. You'll see that guide come through. And this summer learning guide was designed by our team and we call it our summer streaks success guide. It has a lot of different components here. You'll see that it gives some nice pathways of things that can students can access things that you can do to support students in the summertime. We will be talking about a few of those in just a second. You will see that there is a guide for teachers. There's a student guide in here as well. Parent guide and sample parent letter as you're thinking about summer learning at your school sites. And so that resource is here for you. That will be sent out after as well. We are going to talk a little bit more about a couple of things. You'll see them start on my screen right now. We've got a get a jump on math streak that I really love and I'm excited to talk with you about today where students can get a practice on upcoming math skills with something called our get ready for courses. And so we'll dive into that a little bit. Students can also decide to keep up their skills or maybe practice skills and go into some of that unfinished learning that they might have from the school year. And there's also some guidance for writing workshop. So we're going to go into those three today. So first, if you are familiar with our Khan Academy courses, and if you haven't logged into your Khan Academy account, I recommend doing that because as you know, we always give you something to try or something to do within our sessions. And remember that we've got a plethora of courses. We've got courses, everything from math to science to reading and language arts. There's some life skill courses in here that can be pretty exciting. There's financial literacy for those students that might need to learn about that. There are arts and humanities classes. And don't forget, we've talked about this in our previous sessions that a lot of our content is available in over like 50 languages. And so it is possible to change the language within the dashboard and to get support that way for any learners that want to dive in. We will, I am going to be highlighting for you are get ready for math courses. These are here, they are only for math currently. And what's nice about these courses is that they give students a way to get a jump start on the next school year's math content. And they're about a third of the size of regular Khan Academy courses. They only highlight the essential skills so tend to be a reduced amount of work to go through. It can pretty be pretty exciting for students. As we talk and as we get into that couple of things I just want to remind you of and just some thoughts around students working within the courses and within that content is that we recommend that they're working about 30 to 60 minutes a week as they're going through, that they're working to level up those skills. You might be familiar with our mastery levels we call it our mastery loop and students are working through and working to get to that purple master proficient and mastered. And they have conmigo for extra support, especially those that have district partnership with us that have conmigo added in students will have access to that conmigo tutoring chat box as they go through that content. And we'll take a look at what that looks like. There are other tools and supports that exist within our content that we exist within our platform that I would be remiss to forget to mention to you. We have closed captioning and transcripts with our videos. There is immediate feedback when students are working on problems, I'll give you a chance to dive into that in just a second. There's a scratch paper function within the practice exercises so students have kind of a built in whiteboard as they're working through the math problems. And we have articles with step by step guidance and tutorial videos that are linked there as well. And of course, the most probably exciting feature is conmigo our little AI friend that is available to support students as they're working in that content. So I've said a lot there. Let's dive into it and let's try it out. So if you haven't already logged into your Khan Academy account, or if you are new here and you are just learning about Khan Academy right now, it is free to create a Khan Academy chat box. You can create a Khan Academy teacher account, and you have access to all the course content, and you have a set of teacher tools that are available for you with conmigo learners also can make free accounts. And we're going to go into those get ready for courses for a moment and just do a little exploration there before we talk about writing. And so I am going to move on over to my Khan Academy account, just to my demo account here. And if you haven't made an account with Khan Academy, it's just Khan Academy.org, and then join. And when I'm here, we can find the get ready for courses under the explore drop down. And we are going to go to, there's a whole selection of math, but we're going to go scroll down just a little bit to math, get ready courses. And they're all the way get ready for third all the way up through AP statistics, there's even a get ready for SAT prep that is new. But those exist here. I will give you the chance to choose whatever you'd like to explore. You can choose I'll go ahead and I did a while teaching fourth, fifth and sixth was my area as a teacher for about 10 years. And so I'll choose fifth grade as an example. I miss my fifth graders. I have a set of units. This is about a third of the amount of skills that students who are regularly working in the Khan Academy math course for fifth grade. This is about a third of skills. And so here are my units. I can click in. Choose a unit and click into and see how the videos work. I can click into a practice exercise. And I'll do that here. And conmigo is at that right corner, as long as students have conmigo access, it will appear on that right corner, little purple circle. And then you can see conmigo is cute little googly eyes and face and conmigo is here to support. So let me give you Just a couple minutes To try it out. See what that get ready for math course looks like. Try out conmigo support as you're going through. And even if you don't have conmigo, go ahead and go through and exercise. And that's what that looks like for your students. Don't forget that there's a little annotate button here at the far left side. If you want to bring that up to another little circle button that will allow you to bring up the little whiteboard feature. So we're going to go quiet for a moment, allow you to do that for about a minute or two, and then we'll move in to writing. On my side, I'm asking conmigo as I'm looking at my problem here to help me solve this. I didn't have to even ask the question. I just clicked on the little action bubble that conmigo provides. And can we go get me started. We'll ask me some questions about what do I notice start with that Socratic questioning and then give me some other options. If I don't have a question in mind right away. I can say explain simply give an example. What's the number choice. And I can continue to get that scaffolded support. Pretty nifty. So what else. Right. So we've got these get ready for courses. And of course you've got all of the other courses that exist on the Khan Academy side. What else is there that you can have access to within Khan Academy. Well, I'm excited to talk with you about writing coach. How many of you have heard of writing coach put a thumbs up in the chat. If you have heard of writing coach or maybe you saw us, our CEO and founder and 60 minutes when they did an interview and demonstrated that. How many of you have seen writing coach in action. If not, that's okay too. You can put the thumbs down if you haven't seen it yet. I'm going to show you. Okay. So, writing coach exists in the Khan Academy dashboard. It is a free conmigo tool that exists for teachers. And if you create an assignment for your class, it will appear for students as well for them to work in. And so I'm excited to talk with you about that feature and how that can be used strategically for even some of our summer learning. So writing coach what it is, is it is a tool that is designed to help students work through the entire writing process. So it was designed as a support for students to become better writers. And basically, the original writing coach had students go through the beginning of the writing process of working on a prompt, getting those instructions, being able to use conmigo as a tool to ask questions about how to get started about understanding that prompt, going through outlining drafting revising and getting feedback from conmigo, and that still exists in both the free version and in the paid version, but also just updated on our side is the option to have students get just essay feedback. And so what that means is that if you are, don't want students to go through the whole process with Khan Academy and conmigo's help, students can come with already pre written draft, put it into writing coach and conmigo will still give feedback to students on areas that they can continue to work in and such. And so this is new. This has come out in the last couple weeks and is available within the writing coach tool. So I'm going to show you that now. So if you are in your Khan Academy dashboard, how you find writing coach is it's under that conmigo drop down on the top side of your Khan Academy dashboard. And let me go back to the beginning here. And you'll see conmigo drop down and you should see a call out to writing coach. Once you're there. Writing coach will open up a whole new tab. And when you're here, there's a couple of things. There's an area for assignments, my essays and about writing coach. Let's go do about writing coach, only because it's a nice starting spot. And it looks like this for you as teachers. It looks similar on the student side as well. And when you're here, you can see that that gives you a little bit of information about writing coach, there is even a little video overview done by a member of our team Rachel she's super awesome. I'm telling you how to use writing coach if you're unfamiliar, it's about six minute video or so. But what I'd like to show you is what this looks like on the student end and also give you a chance to try it out and go through it as a student. We won't finish it today in our short time together, but can give you a taste of what this would look like for your students. So there is an option to create a new assignment or write a new essay. So as a teacher, you can create a new assignment. And you can give an assignment title, decide on what type of assignment you want to set for students, whether you want them to go through that full writing process from beginning to end or get feedback on something that they've already been. Select your grade level and essay type and put in the prompt and instructions. I'm going to briefly and very quickly show you what that looks like on the student side. It is a pretty great process, but I'll give you just a taste of what this is like. So let's say as a student, I got the assignment of doing a persuasive essay. This is a ninth grade level and I am going to argue for or against the observance of daylight savings time. Notice that Conmigo is here on the side. And this is an example of how students might be asking Conmigo questions about what to do for this prompt. Maybe I don't understand what MLA formatting looks like or what is a credible source because my teacher wants me to put in credible sources. I can ask questions and get Conmigo support. Then I go through the outlining phase and this is the full essay writing process. Write my thesis, start working on my body paragraph. I can ask Conmigo for support. I can try to cheat and say give me a thesis because I don't want to write it and Conmigo is going to say I can't provide a new thesis, but I can help you think of one. I can go through the drafting phase of writing my draft and still have Conmigo support. Ask it to check my work so far. What have I done well? What are some things I can work on? And when I get to that revising phase, Conmigo will actually give me four buckets of suggestions in these different areas. So for my introduction, what did I do well? What do I need some more support with? It will give me some ideas. And so on. And so the power of writing coach is that students have access to Conmigo as a support. On the teacher side, teachers do get a report and get to see exactly how the student did on their essays. I will show you that very, very briefly. It would look like this. If I went in to review how my students did in that process, I'll even get flags on originality if I think if Conmigo thinks that something came into their essay that doesn't match. And if they pasted words from an outside source that gets flagged and teachers have visibility into that. And so that is writing coach in a very quick nutshell. But in your summer streaks guide, you do have some suggestions on how to get started with writing coach for the summer. How you can assign your students an essay, give them time to go through that writing process, or students who come into writing coach themselves and start their own essay and go through that way as long as they have Conmigo access. I will give you some prompts to try on your own. And again, we don't have time in the five minutes that we have left together, but this can be a leave behind for you that you can give it a try and just see what does that feel like as you're going through with Conmigo. And that's going to be coming in the chat in just a second. And there you go, just some sample essay prompts. If you're thinking about, let me try this out and start a new assignment and give this writing coach a try. You can use these prompts to get you started. There's even a full essay draft in there if you want to just paste it in there and see the type of feedback Conmigo will give you can do that as well. And just a reminder that you do have teacher tools that are available for you. Once you have your Khan Academy account teacher tools come with your teacher account. And if even if you're thinking okay during summer, I don't have a full, you know, curriculum to think about using with my students to work on writing. Use those tools for your benefit. You've got chat GPT as a teacher tool with your account, and that you can get some notes on, hey, what are some prompts that I can use with my students for writing. You can craft a writing assignment using clear directions. And you can even craft a rubric for that writing in a matter of maybe three minutes. And so don't forget that those teacher tools exist. Okay. I've shared a lot with you. And there's a lot that for you to dig in as well as you look at that summer streaks guide and you consider about some of the options that are available for you with Khan Academy. And so my question to you now is what are you excited to share maybe with your team, or even with your students about summer learning with Khan Academy. One takeaway. Yeah, they get ready for math courses. Those are pretty great. Yep, that summer learning guide is pretty excellent. And again, I went through a very quick version of that. There's some real nice step by step directions in there for you. Awesome. Yep, get a jump on math. Love it. I love that using the teacher tools to create a summer learning module. I think there's enough tools in there in your teacher tools to do just that. Love that. All right, in terms of next steps. Just a reminder that we're almost to the end of our spring West Coast sessions, and so we have one more left in May, we've got on five eight we've got celebrating student success. Definitely don't miss that Jennifer will be leading that one with you. And just a reminder of our lunch. We know that technology plays a major role inside and outside the classroom, and we want to make sure that it is accessible to students. And so we thank you here as part of your Khan Academy team. I always appreciate all of you and the work that you're doing and I hope you can get to your summer destinations, as soon as possible, because I know that you need it. And so thank you so much for your time today, and I will stick around for any questions that pop up. I forgot to put my session title up there. Thank you so much. Thanks so much. Have a great day everyone. I'm Alex Roberts, I'll get back to you very soon. Thank you. Thank you. Sheeshinyi Sa environments, I'm also going to go over some information in this series byIA …
