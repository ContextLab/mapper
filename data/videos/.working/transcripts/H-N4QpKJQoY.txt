So I have the graph of a function f here. And the first thing I wanna do is, I wanna figure out all of the x values where the function intersects the x-axis. Or another way to think about it is, what are the x values where f of x is equal to zero? So pause this video and see if you can pick those out. Okay, so when f of x is equal to zero, that means we are intersecting the x-axis. So that's there, that is there, and then that is there. And we can see what these points are. It's a little bit small on the screen, but we can see that that happens at x equals negative two. So we could say, for example, that f of negative two is equal to zero. We can see that this is, let's see, this is, if that's negative two, this is negative one, this is negative one and a half. So f of negative 1.5 is equal to zero, that's this point there. And then this last one over here, that looks like three, x equals three. So f of three is equal to zero. Fair enough. Now let me ask you another question. When, well, we're going to think about, what, at what x values does the function equal 15? Well, when you look at it that way, if you say 15 right over here, that's the function, that's y equals 15. And it looks like it's happening right over here, right over here, and right over here. So it's not happening exactly at any integer values of x. For example, this is, looks like it's happening at a point that is not quite at negative three. It's between negative two and a half and three, negative three, it's much closer to negative three. So I could write here, it's between, between negative 2.5 and three. Or if we, or let me be very careful, that's between, oh yeah, negative 2.5, negative 2.5 and three. If we said what integers is between, we could say it's between negative two and negative three. So between negative 2.5 and negative three, I should say, we'd be very careful. Or if we wanted to say between what integers, we could say it's between negative two and negative three. Similarly, this point right over here, it looks like it's between x equals, it's happening between x equals zero and x equals negative one half. If we want to think about integers, we could say it's between zero and negative one. And then this point right over here, it looks, integers, it's happening between x equals two and x equals three, that the function takes on the value 15. And if you want to get a little bit more precise and you're willing to go beyond integers, it's between two and a half and three. So I'm just doing this, so you get practice just thinking about when does a function take on certain values. Sometimes you can read it pretty clearly and you can get the exact answer. When you're looking at a graph, ideally, they make it very clear that the graph is intersecting the axis at those points, maybe by drawing some dots. And that sometimes you might have to approximate. Like we just said, when does this function equal 15? Well, I don't have the exact x value just by looking at this, but I can tell you roughly where it is. It's between negative two and a half and negative three. And it's actually much closer to negative three.
