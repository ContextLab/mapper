Money market funds are really just open-ended mutual funds, but instead of investing in stocks, they invest in really safe loans and T-or I guess really safe bonds and T-bills. So here's, let's say that this is the asset side of our money market fund, and right over here is the equity side. We'll assume it has no liabilities. And the value, the total value of this equity is often referred to in mutual fund world as the net asset value. So if this was divided into a million shares, you would take the NAV, divided into a million shares, and you would have your net asset value per share. Now this structure that I just drew here is true for any mutual fund. But when we're talking about money market funds, we're actually talking about what they're investing in here on this asset side. So on a money market mutual fund, they'll invest in things like treasury bills, which are really just loans to the federal government that will mature in a year or less, or that, I guess you could view it as the lender's going to get paid back in a year or less, or commercial paper. And commercial paper is just another word for short-term debt to really, really, really safe corporations and banks. So commercial paper. And just to be clear, T-bills mature in one year or less, and commercial paper matures in one to 270 days. So the reason why it's called the money market is because it's the short-term debt. You're lending to these safe entities on a very short-term basis, just so they can meet their, I guess you could say, their cash requirements or their money requirements. But in general, these type of mutual funds, these money market funds, are considered to be super duper duper safe. Because besides the fact that these are safe people to lend to, you're also going to be getting your money pretty soon. And these are also super liquid markets. So for whatever reason, even if you can't wait for the 30 days until that commercial paper matures, it's very likely that it's a very liquid market and you could probably sell that security and get a good value for it. So the general reason why people invest in money market funds is kind of an alternative to savings. I can buy a share of one of these open-ended funds. I'll get a little bit of interest on it. It'll probably be a bit better interest than I would get in my savings or checking account. And it is, at least from the point of view of many, many investors, comparably, comparably safe.
