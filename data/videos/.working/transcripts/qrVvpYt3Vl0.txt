According to the pictograph below, how many survey respondents have type O positive blood? How many have O negative blood? So a pictograph is really just a way of representing data with pictures that are somehow related to the data. So in this case, they give us little pictures of, I'm assuming, blood drops right over here. And then they tell us that each blood drop in this pictograph represents eight people. So you can view that as a scale of these graphs. Each of these say eight people. So for example, if you say how many people have A positive, it would be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven blood drops. But each of those blood drops represent eight people. So it would be 56 people have type A positive. But let's answer the actual question that they're asking us. How many survey respondents have type O positive? So this is O, and then we care about O positive. So we have one blood drop, two, three. Let me do this in a new different color. We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So we have eight drops. I'll put those in quotes because it's pictures of drops. And then the scale is eight people times eight people per drop. And so eight times eight, and actually even the drops, you can view them as canceling out if you view them as units. So drops, drops. Eight times eight is equal to 64 people. So they could have written literally the number 64 right over here. 64 people have type O positive blood. Now let's think about the O negative case. O negative blood. Well, this is O. And then within the blood group O, this is O negative. And we have one drops, two drops. So we have two drops times eight people per drop. And so two times eight, each of these represent eight. So eight and then 16. Or two times eight is equal to 16 people. So 16 of the survey respondents, 16 have type O negative. 64 have type O positive.
