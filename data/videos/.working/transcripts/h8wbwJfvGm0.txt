Hi everyone, Sal Khan here from Khan Academy and I'm here to remind you that we are a not-for-profit with a mission of providing a free world-class education for anyone anywhere. We're a not-for-profit with the budget of a large high school and our ambitions and what we're already reaching is in the hundreds of millions and eventually billions of learners. So if you believe that the world needs an institution or the world needs something on the internet that's creating more light than heat, then please think seriously about donating to Khan Academy because we really wouldn't be able to serve the hundreds of millions to billions of learners without support from folks like yourself.
