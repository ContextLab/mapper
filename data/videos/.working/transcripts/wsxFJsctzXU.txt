We are asked to select the diagram that represents one sixth times one fourth. So why don't you pause this video, have a go at it before we do this together. Okay, before I even look at these choices, I could think about what this might look like. So if I had a square unit, I'm just gonna hand draw it so it's a little bit shaky here. So I could imagine having one sixth on this, on the left side and then one fourth on top. So how would I do that? So I would divide it into six equal sections horizontally. So I could do it like this. So it could look something like this where each of these is one sixth. And then I'm going to multiply and maybe I would put that maybe in that color. And then in the other direction, I would divide it into fourths. So let's see, that's about half. And then I will put those in half to get fourths. So one sixth times one fourth. And so the fourth, let me do this in a light color so it doesn't write over, it would be that. Let me do it in a color that you can actually see. It might be all of that right over there. And then their overlap would be right over here. So this would be one sixth times one fourth and that's actually one 24th of this entire square. So let's see, do I see anything that looks like that? Let's see, this first one looks like one fourth times one fourth, that's not right. This one looks like one sixth because this is a sixth right here, but it's one sixth times one half because in this direction, we're only split into two. This one over here doesn't look like what we did, but if we turn it around and if we do it the other way, where if we divide it into fourths on horizontally and then into sixth vertically, it looks a lot like choice C. So if I divide it into sixth here, so if I had a fourth times a sixth, a fourth would be that entire row, a sixth would be this entire column. When you take their product, you would get that shaded area, which is exactly what they did in choice C. So this is one fourth times one sixth and you get that shaded area. So I like choice C.
