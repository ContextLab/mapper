Let's think about where we would plot two-thirds on this number line. So first of all, let's make sure we understand what each of these little hash marks are. We have one hash mark, we're starting at zero, then we get one hash mark, two hash marks, three hash marks take us all the way to one. Or another way to think about it is, these hash marks have divided our number line between zero and one into three equal spaces. So each of the, they're essentially, it's dividing the space between zero and one into three, so each of these are incrementing by one-third. So this takes us to one-third, then this, we go another third, it takes us to two-thirds, and then this takes us to three-thirds. I'll write it up here, which is the exact same thing as one. And so we've already answered our question. Where would we plot two over three? Well, it is right over there. Where would we plot one over three? Well, this is in thirds, so it would be right over there.
