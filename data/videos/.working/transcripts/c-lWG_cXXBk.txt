- [David] Greetings and
salutations, oh, you wordsmiths. You who make language
simply by thinking it. Oh, you dreamers and schemers. Hi. Too complicated, too wordy, too elaborate? Perhaps, but I gotta be me. It's a necessity. Can't be a David without
the classic David Wordiness. It's a package deal. As you can tell from my
having written them down, the words in this video are
elaborate and necessity, which I shall define in short order. Then we'll do some word origins, and finally I'll use
them both in a sentence. Elaborate, it's an adjective and a verb. As an adjective, it means
detailed or complex. Like my introduction just now. That was really detailed. As a verb, it means to
explain in more detail and you say it slightly differently. The adjective is elaborate. The verb is elaborate. Subtle difference. And necessity is a noun. It means something that
is required or needed. Word origin time, elaborate
comes from ex and labor, ex meaning out, and labor meaning work. Labor is a standalone word in
English that also means work. One of those words where the
letter X disappears from the ex prefix, where the X is hiding. You see this also in words
like eject, to throw out or erase, to rub or scrape out. Why? It's just easier to
say erase than "ex-rase." Easier to say eject than "ex-ject." The root labor gives us
words like collaborate, working together or laborious,
a thing that is a lot of work or takes a lot of work and laboratory, a place
where work happens. Necessity is made of three parts. Ne meaning not, ces or ced
meaning give up, give in, or just go, and ity,
I-T-Y, which makes the word into a noun. A noun-forming suffix, we call it. So a necessity is something
you can't give up. Water, food, shelter. It's a requirement. You can't go without it. For me, it's beans, a necessity
for life, Pinto beans, black beans, cannellinis,
and my beloved good mothers stallards, which I just grew
in my backyard this year. Other words that use ces
or ced as a root include cease, which means to stop or halt, to give up what you're doing. Recess, when you get to
stop what you're doing and go back somewhere else, re means back. So recess is when students
get break time to go play outside, or when politicians
call a break in a lawmaking session. That's also called a recess. Incessant, in also means not so an incessant thing does not stop. It does not cease. Imagine an incessant car alarm. It keeps going off, horrible. I can imagine it now, and I'd rather not. Let's use these words in
some sentences, Wordsmiths. "Francisco's Halloween
decorations were always elaborate, but the year he hired actual zombies was a bit much." His decorations were always complicated and took a lot of work. "Dr. Mercurio elaborated on her evil plan by describing the exact flight
path her spacecraft would take as she stole the
ice caps off of Mars." She's explaining it. She's
describing it in detail. Wordsmiths, hey, please
don't steal the ice caps. Relatedly, "If you are going to space, then extra oxygen is a necessity, if you enjoy breathing, that is." Because again, you need oxygen to live. Can't get along without it. And I need vocabulary to
live and thrive the same way plants need light and water. Without words, I would wither
and die like an unloved fern. (David sighs) But I've got plenty of words, all the words in the world, in fact. So I'll be fine. I'll see you in the next one. You can learn anything, David out.
