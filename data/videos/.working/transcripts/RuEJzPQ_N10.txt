Part B. For x is not equal to zero, express f prime of x as a piecewise defined function. Find the value of x for which f prime of x is equal to negative three. So the first thing you might be wondering is why did we even have to take out x is equal to zero or why is the derivative not going to be defined there? And that's just because you're going to see that the derivative is going to be something different when we approach x is equal to zero from the left versus when we approach x is equal to zero from the right. And that's why they just took it out of there for us. But let's just figure out what that derivative is for all the other values of x. So f prime of x is equal to... So for x is less than zero, we're going to take the derivative of this first case. So the derivative of one is just zero. The derivative of negative two sine of x, well derivative of sine of x is just cosine of x. So it's going to be negative two cosine of x. Negative two cosine of x for x is less than zero. And then for x is greater than zero, I'll do this in another color, I'll do it in orange. We have this case right over here. And we'll just do the chain rule, derivative of negative four x with respect to x is negative four. And derivative of e to the negative four x with respect to... The derivative of e to the negative four x with respect to negative four x is just e to the negative four x. E to the negative four x. Sometimes you can say this is the derivative of the inside times the derivative of the outside with respect to the inside. So either way, it's negative four e to the negative four x. Four x is greater than zero. So we did the first part. We expressed f prime of x as a piecewise defined function. We didn't define the derivative. Actually, I forgot a parenthesis here. We didn't define the derivative when x is equal to zero, because it's actually not going to be defined there. Now let's do the second part. Find the value of x for which f prime of x is equal to negative three. And so if this wasn't piecewise defined, you just very simply just say, oh look, you know f prime of x is equal to negative three. You would take whatever f prime of x is equal to and you do some algebra to solve for it. But here you're like, well which case do I use? I don't know if the x that gets us to negative three is going to be less than zero, or I don't know if it's going to be greater than zero. So I don't know which case to use. And one thing that I realized is to look at these functions a little bit, and realize that cosine of x is a bounded function. Cosine of x can only go between positive one and negative one. So negative two cosine of x can only go between positive two and negative two. So this can only go between positive two and negative two. So it can never get to negative three. So if anything's ever going to get to negative three, it's going to have to be this part of the derivative, or this part of the derivative definition. So it's going to have to be this thing right over here. And hopefully there's some values of x greater than zero, where this thing right over here is equal to negative three. So let's try it out. Negative four e to the negative 4x needs to be equal to negative three. We can divide both sides by negative four. We get e to the negative 4x is equal to negative 3 fourths divided by negative 4 is 3 fourths. We could take the natural log of both sides, and we will get negative 4x is equal to the natural log of 3 fourths. And just to be clear what I did here, you literally could put the natural log here, natural log there, and you could put the natural log there as well to see that step. This is saying what power would have to raise e to to get e to the negative 4x? Well, obviously, I just need to raise e to the negative 4x over there. So this power is negative 4x. And then we just took the natural log of the right hand side as well. And then to solve for x, we can divide both sides by negative 4. So you get x is equal to, or we could say we could multiply both sides by negative 1 fourth either way, negative 1 fourth natural log of 3 fourths. And what we need to do is verify that this x, so we used this case right over here. But we have to make sure that we can use this case, that this x is greater than 0. And we might be tempted right when we look at this to say, wait, wait, this looks like a negative number. But we have to remind ourselves that the natural log of 3 fourths, since 3 fourths is less than e, the natural log of 3 fourths is going to be a negative number. It's going to be e to some negative exponent. So since this is negative and this part right over here is negative, so that is also negative, you have a negative times a negative, so this right over here is going to be positive. So this is a positive value right over here. So you would use this case right over here. So that's our answer. x is equal to negative 1 fourth natural log of 3 fourths. Or the derivative, we could write f prime of negative 1 fourth times the natural log of 3 fourths is equal to negative 3. And we're done.
