On the number line above, the tick marks are equally spaced and the coordinates are shown. Of these coordinates, which has the smallest positive value, so this is interesting, these are equally spaced, we start at negative eight and we have one, two, three, four, five, six equal spaces to get all the way to ten. So what must be the space between these tick marks here? Well, to go from negative eight to ten, to go all the way from negative eight to ten, you have increased by eighteen. Or the difference between negative eight and ten is eighteen. You have to go eight to get to zero and then ten more to get to ten. So this distance is eighteen. We've split it into six sections, six equal sections. So eighteen divided by six, each of these sections must have a length of three. So they each have a length of three. So now we can figure out the values of a, b, c, d, and e. A gets us to negative five, I'm just adding three each time. B is at negative two and then you add three, you get to c, which is at one, and we've already answered our question. This is the smallest positive value. We have just, we went from the most negative, we keep increasing, and this is the first of the choices, this is the first positive value we hit. So c has the smallest positive, positive value. And then we could keep going if you're curious. D, you're adding another three, d is four, e is seven, and then you add three more and we get to ten. We wanted the smallest positive value out of the choices and that's going to be c.
