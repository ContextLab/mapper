Hi, my name is Sal Khan. I'm the founder of Khan Academy. And I'm also the author of a new book about artificial intelligence and education called Brave New Words. And OpenAI invited myself and my son Imran here to try out some of their new technology. And so we're curious about how good it might be at tutoring someone in math on Khan Academy. So let's get it started. It's loading up. All right, make sure it can see our screen. Actually, in this form… Hello there. I'm here with my son and I'd love you to tutor him on this math problem. But don't give him the answer. You can ask questions and nudge him in the right direction. But I really want to make sure he understands it himself. And he's here in the room so you can talk to him directly. Of course, I'd be happy to help. Let's look at the problem together. Can you first identify which sides of the triangle are the opposite adjacent and hypotenuse relative to angle alpha? All right, so I'm pretty sure this is the angle alpha right here, right? Vicked. That's correct. Now, looking at the triangle, which side do you think is the hypotenuse? Um… Remember the hypotenuse? I'm not totally sure. I think it might be this one, but I really am not sure. This side AC? You're close. Actually, side AC is called the adjacent side to the angle alpha. The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and is directly opposite the right angle. Can you find which one is the hypotenuse? Oh, okay. I see. So, I think the hypotenuse is this really long side from A to B. Would that be correct? Exactly. Well done. Now that you've identified the hypotenuse, can you identify which side is the opposite side to angle alpha? Okay, well, I mean, you told me earlier that this was the adjacent side, and I know that's the hypotenuse, so I'm guessing that this side, BC, is the opposite side. Great deduction. That's absolutely correct. Now that you've identified all the sides relative to angle alpha, do you remember the formula for finding the sine of an angle in a right triangle? Yeah, I know that the sine is equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse. Perfect. That's absolutely right. Now, can you apply that formula to find sine alpha in the triangle using the lengths of the sides that we've identified? Okay, so, I mean, you told me that seven, this side BC, is the opposite side, and then you said that the hypotenuse is the longest side, so that would be this side AB, which is 25. So, would the answer be seven over 25? Excellent work. That's correct. Sine alpha equals seven over 25. You did a great job identifying the sides at using the sine formula. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
