Use the Rotate tool to find the image of Pentagon C-D-E-F-G, that's this irregular Pentagon over here, when it rotated 270 degrees about the point negative two comma three. The direction of rotation by a positive angle is counterclockwise, so it's counter, counterclockwise. All right, Rotate tool to rotate around negative two comma three. So let's click on Rotate, and then we wanna go to the point. They say rotate around the point negative two comma three, so I move this to x equals negative two, y equals three. That's what we wanna rotate around, and we wanna rotate 270 degrees. So this is maybe the part that takes the most visualization. If we rotate 90 degrees, that would be going from, if we think about this arrow right, actually let me just do it. So if I move this arrow up here, I have rotated 90 degrees, positive 90 degrees, we're moving counterclockwise. Now if I move it over here, we have rotated 180 degrees, and now I move it down here, I have now rotated it 270 degrees. If they said 360, we would get back to where we started. So this is 270 degrees, just like that. And we're done. Let's check our answer, and we got it right.
