We're told Omar takes $10 to the farmer's market. He spends $8.79 on fruit. Which image represents how much money Omar has left? So pause this video and have a go at that before we do this together. Okay, so he takes $10 to the farmer's market. So that's how much he starts with. And I'll put the cents here as well. And then he spends $8.79 on fruit. So we wanna subtract that out. And when I write the subtraction, we wanna make sure that we line up the place values. So the ones placed below the ones placed, the decimal below the decimal. $8.79 is what we're going to subtract. And so now let's start our subtraction. So immediately when we go to the hundreds place, we see, well, we can't subtract nine from zero. We can't subtract in the tens place seven from zero, even in the ones place. How do we subtract eight from zero? So we're going to have to do a little bit of regrouping or some people might call it borrowing. So let's take a 10 from the tens place and put it in the ones place. So a 10 is literally 10 ones, but we're not done yet. So we, because we have to worry about these zeros. So let's take one of those ones away. So we're now left with nine ones. And that one that we took away, we're going to regroup, that's equivalent to 10 tenths. And then if we take one of those tenths away, that 10th is equivalent to 10 hundredths. And now we can subtract. 10 minus nine is equal to 100th. Nine tenths minus seven tenths is two tenths. We have our decimal right over here. And the nine ones minus eight ones is one one. So we get, he has $1.21 left. So which image represents that? Well, image A looks like just 21 cents. It's less than a dollar, so we'll rule that out. Image B, it's less than a dollar still. So let's just rule that out. So it should be image C and it does make sense because we have the $1 right over here. And then here we have 20 cents. And then here we have one more cent. We have one more cent. Or another way to think about it is we have 21 of these hundredths filled in. So this is a dollar and 21. So I like choice C.
