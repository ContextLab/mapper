So my goal here is to find the area of this rectangle right over here. And we can assume it is a rectangle. And so to figure that out, we just have to take two of the side lengths. For example, this side length here, we have to figure out what that is. And then if we figure out this side length, and if we were to multiply them, then we would get the area. Now, how do we figure out those side lengths? Well, I luckily have a ruler right over here. So let's see, this side length over here. And I wanna be very careful. I wanna start my ruler right at the beginning, right at zero. Some people make the mistake of trying to start at one or at some other number. No, you can't start anywhere. You have to start right at the beginning. So I'm starting, you could think of that as zero before I get to one. And it looks like I go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven centimeters. Let me be careful. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven centimeters in that direction. So let me write that down. And if I measure this other side, this is a rectangle, it should be the same. And yes, that one also is seven centimeters. And now this length over here, it looks like it is, once again, I'm starting at zero. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight centimeters. So this is eight centimeters. And so this one up here should be eight centimeters if this is really a rectangle. And we see that it is. So now I've done the measurements and I can figure out the area. It's just going to be this side length times this side length. So let's see, if I took seven centimeters times eight centimeters, seven times eight is equal to 56 square, square centimeters, centimeters. And we are done.
