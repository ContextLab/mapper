The goal of this video is for you to appreciate how much interest and the interest rate can affect how much you pay over time and also how long it takes you to pay it off. So let's say you were to go out there, get a car loan, say for $10,000, so people would call that the principal, that's the amount that you're actually borrowing. And let's imagine that the interest rate, let's start with a lower interest rate, let's say 5%, and let's say you do this over five years, but I'm gonna say that in terms of months, 60 months. So we can see here that our monthly payment is $188.71. So let's think about the total that we pay, 188.71 times 60 months is going to give me $11,322.60. So I paid back that $10,000 in principal, plus I paid another $1,322.60, that $1,322.60, that is in interest. Now, what if I were to increase the loan term? So instead of paying it off in five years, if I were to pay it off in 10 years, so that would be 120 months. Well, it seems tempting, our payment just went down by a lot, it's a much smaller monthly payment, but let's look at how much we're paying in total. So 120 months, 10 years, times $106.07, our interest has gone up dramatically. We're now paying $2,728.40 more than our principal. So it almost roughly, give or take, doubled it when we doubled the term. Similarly, what do you think is going to happen when we double the interest rate here? So if we go from a 5% interest rate to a 10% interest rate, well, now all of a sudden our monthly payment has gone up and it really adds up when you look at $132.15 times 120 months, now we're paying $5,858 more than the principal amount. So hopefully this little exercise has helped make clear that even though it might be tempting to pay things off over a longer period of time, you're paying a lot more interest. And it's also important to get that interest rate down as much as possible to compare interest rates. And especially if you're paying a high interest rate, then keep that term down, how long you actually have to pay it down, that loan paid off as quickly as possible. And one good way to get a lower interest rate is to have a good credit rating, which we talk about in other videos.
