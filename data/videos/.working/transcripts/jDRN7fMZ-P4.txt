We are told that Jamil earns $15 each week for mowing lawns. He saves $5 a week for a video game that costs $27. About how long will it take Jamil to save for the video game? Pause this video and have a go at this. All right, so let's think about what's happening. We know that he's earning $15, but that's not what he's saving every week. It looks like he only saves five. So he's spending 10 of those 15, and then he's keeping five every week for that game. So if we multiply the number of weeks times $5 a week, that's how much he saves. So if we take five weeks times $5 per week, this is going to be $25. So that one's not enough. Let's see, if we take six weeks times $5 per week, that gets us to $30. Six times five is 30. Well, that seems enough. And if you do more than that, he's going to just be saving way more than he needs for that video game.
