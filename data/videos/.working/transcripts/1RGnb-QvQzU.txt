Consider the function f of x is equal to one over x squared minus kx, where k is a non-zero constant. The derivative of f is given by, and they give us this expression right over here, that's nice that they took the derivative for us. Now part a, let k equals three so that f of x is equal to one over x squared minus three x, so they said k equal to three. Write an equation for the line tangent to the graph of f at the point whose x coordinate is four. So to find an equation for a line, the equation of a line is gonna be of the form y is equal to mx plus b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. And the slope of the line right over here, this needs to be equal to the derivative evaluated when x is equal to four. So we could say y is equal to, let me write it this way, we could say that m is going to be equal to f prime when x is equal to four, so f prime of four, which is equal to, well we know that k is equal to three, so they gave us f prime of x, so it's going to be three minus two times, we're taking f prime of four, so minus two times four over x squared, so that's going to be four squared minus k is three times four, three times four, and then we square that whole thing. And so what is this going to be? This is an eight right over here, and all I did is, f prime of x, when k is equal to three, is gonna be three minus two x over x squared minus three x and all of that squared, and I wanted to evaluate what f prime of four is. So wherever it's the place where I saw an x, I substituted with a four, where I saw that k, k is three, and so this is going to be equal to, the numerator's three minus eight is negative five over, this is 16 minus 12, which is going to be four, 16 minus 12 is four, and then we square it, so it's going to be negative 5 16ths, and so let me write it this way, m is equal to negative 5 16ths. So how do we figure out b now? Well what are the coordinates? When x is equal to four, what is y going to be equal to? Well y is equal to f of x, so we know that y, on the curve, we know that y is going to be equal to f of four, so before we evaluated f prime of four, now we're gonna evaluate y as being f of four, which is equal to one over four squared, four squared minus three times four, and so that is equal to one over 16 minus 12, which is four, and so this point right here, when x is four, then y is equal to one fourth, so we can use that information to solve for b. When y is one fourth, x, so we're gonna say if y is equal to m, which is negative 5 16ths, negative 5 16ths, times x, well when y is one fourth, x is, or when I say when x is equal to four, y is one fourth, and then plus b, so I can now solve for b. So all I did is I used f prime of x, I used f prime of x to figure out m when x is equal to four, and then I said okay well what is the value of y when x is equal to four, and so if I know y, m, and x, then I can solve for b, and so let's just do that. We get one fourth is equal to four times negative 5 16ths is negative 5 over 4 plus b. I can add 5 fourths to both sides, and I get 5 fourths plus one fourth is equal to b, or b is equal to 6 fourths, 6 over 4, which you could say, well there's a bunch of ways you could write this, we could just say this is equal to 1.5, and so our equation is y is equal to negative 5 over 16 x plus 1.5, or if we wanted to write everything as a fraction, we could say y is equal to negative 5 over 16 x plus 3 halves. 6 fourths is the same thing as 3 s 3 halves, and there you go.
