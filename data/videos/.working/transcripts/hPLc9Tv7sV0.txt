We're told here is a partially completed multiplication table and we could see they go all the way up to the four times tables, I guess you could call it that. And they want us to figure out what eight times six is. So pause this video, have a go at that before we do this together. Okay, so let's think about where eight times six is on this multiplication table. So if we say six times eight, it is over here because we know that eight times six is the same thing as six times eight. Or we could think about eight times six exactly as it's written here, which I would say is this square right over here. So what are ways that we could figure out what goes in these and the same number should go into both of these? Well, one way is to look right over here where they tell us what four times six is. We see that four times six is equal to 24. So based on that, we could say eight times six is going to be twice as much as that. So if we multiply this by two, or another way to think about it, if we added another 24 over here, we're going to get to eight times six. So 24 plus 24, you might recognize as being equal to 48. So that's one way you could have done that. You could have said that is 48. Another way that you could have approached this is you could have tried to fill this one in and you could have said, okay, if we're going down this column, every time we go down one, we're increasing by eight because we're going larger and larger multiples of eight. So eight times five, we would add eight again, we would get to 40. And then if we add eight another time, we would get to 48. So these are all ways to do it. You could also go down this column right over here and add six every time. And you could see that that would work. If you add six to 24, you'd get 30. Add six to that, you get 36. Add six to that, 42. Add six to that, you get to 48.
