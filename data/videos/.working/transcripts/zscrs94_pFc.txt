We tell teachers that you shouldn't be the sage on the stage, but you should actually be the guide on the side, but they really don't have the tools that are necessary to really make that possible to date. One of the big differences with Conacad and me is that we're not trying to just replicate the existing systems, using technology to augment the way existing instruction is done. We're fundamentally thinking about reinventing instruction. We've gotten letters from teachers who said, hey, you've already given the lecture on Lapital's Rule or the Unit Circle. So instead of me giving the basic lecture on that and then assigning homework, we flip the model. I'm assigning the lecture for them to watch at home, and then they can watch what I assigned, and then if they have some questions, they can remediate and watch stuff that was taught in previous sections. Or if they're bored, they can move ahead and go as advanced as they want. And then when they go into the classroom, they can actually do problems. They actually do their homework in the classroom. We have this teacher dashboard right now where it shows all of the students and all of the concepts and within a glance, the teacher can see who's mastered what, who's struggling with what, where each student is in their development and learning. They can see in real time where all the students are in aggregate. The coach will be able to see who's stuck. They can click on any one of the concepts and see exactly what the students have been up to by problem. They can see how long they spent on each problem. Did they get it right or wrong? Did they watch the video before or after working on that problem? If they saw that they got a problem wrong, they can actually click on that part and see the exact problem that they got wrong so they can really diagnose and do very focused interventions to kind of make sure that all of the students are progressing. In every other industry, if you want to diagnose why something is not working, you try to get as much data on it as possible so that you can really say, okay, I need to just tighten that part right over there. What we're trying to do is give teachers that level of data. We can start to impact individuals directly without having to change the entire educational system. To roll it out is actually super simple. It's all web-based. It's all free. So literally, if a school has internet connectivity and has computers, any type of computer, they're ready to start at one plus one and get to calculus.
