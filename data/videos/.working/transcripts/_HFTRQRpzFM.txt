So we have a polynomial right over here. We have a function P of X defined by this polynomial. It's clearly a seventh degree polynomial. And what I want to do is think about what are the possible number of real roots for this polynomial right over here? So what are the possible number of real roots, for example? Because you have nine real roots. And so I encourage you to pause this video and think about what are all the possible number of real roots? So I'm assuming you've given a go at it. So the fundamental theorem of algebra tells us that we are definitely going to have seven roots, some of which could be actually real. So we're definitely not going to have eight or nine or 10 real roots. At most, we're going to have seven real roots. So possible number of real roots. So possible, let me write this down, possible number of real roots. Well, seven is a possibility. If you graph this out, it could potentially intersect the x-axis seven times. Now, would it be possible to have six real roots? Is six real roots a possibility? Is this a possibility? Well, let's think about what that would imply about the non-real complex roots. Actually, let's do it this way. Let me write it this way. So real roots, real, and then non-real, non-real complex. The reason why I'm not just saying complex is because real numbers are a subset of complex numbers. But this is being clear that you're talking about complex numbers that are not real. So you could have seven real roots, and then you would have no non-real roots. And so this is absolutely possible. Now, could you have six real roots? In which case, that would imply that you have one non-real root. Well, no, you can't have this because the non-real complex roots come in pairs, conjugate pairs. So you're always going to have an even number of non-real complex roots. You can't just have one. So let's rule that out. Now, what about having five real roots? That means that you would have two non-real complex adding up to seven. And that, of course, is possible because now you have a pair here. So I think you're starting to see a pattern. Essentially, you can have an odd number of real roots up to and including seven. So for example, this is possible, and I could just keep going. I could have, let's see, four and three. This is not possible because I have an odd number here. You're going to have to have an even number of non-real complex roots. So rule that out. But then if we go to three and four, this is absolutely possible. You have two pairs of non-real complex roots. And then we could go to two and five. Once again, this is an odd number. These come in pairs, so this isn't possible. And then you could go to one real and six non-real, completely possible. This is an even number. And then finally, we could consider having zero real and seven non-real complex. And that's not possible because these are always going to come in pairs. You're always going to have an even number here. So the possible number of real roots, you could have seven real roots, five real roots, three real roots, or one real root for this seventh degree polynomial.
