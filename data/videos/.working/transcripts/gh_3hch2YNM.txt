At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the proposal to replace the existing articles of Confederation with a federal constitution were met with fierce opposition. So what's off here is what was met with fierce opposition. Well, the proposal to replace the existing articles of Confederation with a federal constitution, the proposal is what is being met with fierce opposition. Now, the proposal, this is clearly we're talking We're talking about one proposal, the proposal. This is right over here is singular. Singular, while this right over here, they're saying were met. Well, you wouldn't use were if you're talking about, if it's a singular thing that it's happening to, that it's being met with. So this right over here, this verb is for, if we had many proposals, if this had the proposals to replace the existing Articles of Confederation, were met with Fierce Opposition, then that would make sense. But this needs to be singular. So let's look at the options. So we definitely don't like it as is. Let's rule that out. And so let's see if we can see one that is, where the verb matches the singular noun. So let's see. At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the proposal, and we could even, for the sake of kind of thinking about this, we can ignore to replace the existing Articles of Confederation with the Federal Constitution. So the proposal having been met with fierce opposition, well, once again, now it's not even giving us, it's not even giving us an action for the proposal. It's leaving us hanging. It's a sentence fragment. There's no predicate. So we can rule this one route. The proposal it met with fierce opposition, well, now it's kind of giving us, it's giving us a noun and then a pronoun to refer to the same thing. So that just doesn't make any sense. The proposal met with fierce opposition. That looks pretty good. And let's just read it out, let's read it out the whole thing. At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the proposal to replace the existing Articles of Confederation with a Federal Constitution met with fierce opposition. So that seems exactly right. A single proposal can be met with fierce opposition. You wouldn't say were met with. So this seems right. Now let's just look at this last one. The proposal met their fierce opposition. So who's there referring to? They're not talking about, this is ambiguous. Who is this possessive pronoun there? I don't even see who it's referring to. So let's rule that one out. So we definitely like D.
