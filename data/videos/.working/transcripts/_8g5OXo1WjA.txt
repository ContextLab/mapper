For today, oh, thank you. So for today for learning outcomes, we're going to be identifying teacher tools and also learner activities to enhance whole group tier one instruction, and I'll be giving you all time to explore some of those. And then also as important as administrators, you'll want to monitor data points that you can start seeing those trends seeing where students and teachers are leaning into support using Khan Academy and Khan Migo. And then it's also as critical finding that intentional time for your staff to learn from each other to share those best practices because we're still fairly new and venturing into AI and better understanding how can they learn from each other of using this with their students and using it for themselves. So diving into our teacher tools, if you haven't had a chance yet and I'll dive into the platform to show you with Khan Migo, you'll be able to leverage a lot of tools and being able to provide context for what is going on in the classroom, what teachers are wanting to focus on. So I'm going to switch over to my account. So this is what it will look like when you first sign in as administrators, you'll get a snapshot of your data. We'll come back to this. Where I want you to go if you're following along is at the top, clicking on Khan Migo. We'll get to learner activities, but first we'll go to teacher tools. And so we have a number that you can choose from. Three that I'm going to call out today and I'll show you back on the slide and you'll have this to reference later is for a formative assessment. We want to see where our students are at. A new or a different way that you could approach this is using the Bluget generator. For those who haven't gotten to use Bluget yet, it's a really engaging way to have students answer questions on a specific topic. So you could focus it on simple if you're focused on Algebra 1, if we're doing quadratics, you could put in some of those problems so that students could be doing this in an engaging way in the classroom to be able to answer those questions. So that's one way that teachers can leverage these Khan Migo tools in a more innovative way and engaging way with their students. I won't demo that for the just given the time that we have, but I will give you a video that you can reference and that teachers can utilize. And another tool that I want to focus on with the all is called Make it Relevant. So a lot of y'all had mentioned how do we make this engaging for students. This is a really great way that they can connect what they're teaching in the classroom to something that's interesting for the students because how often do we hear from students like why does this matter when am I ever going to use that. So I'm going to demo this our learning objective today. So I'm going to focus on the pull up. For the standard that I'm teaching today, it's factor of quadratic expression to reveal the zeros of the function it defines. So I could give this quadratic equations, but how can I make this relevant for students. So I'm going to pull up. Let's do March Madness given we're in the middle of it. It's getting fired up. People have their brackets going. So I'm going to hit start and it'll work on creating some learning objectives and ways that I could introduce this in the classroom. So let's see what Kamego has. Use the excitement of March Madness and factoring quadratic expressions. So this one says I could do sounds kind of like a clock like a bracket, but using quadratic expressions. I'm kind of iffy on that. We'll come back to that one. This one. Okay. This one I could see. So it's integrating the concept of basketball shots to illustrate the application of quadratic functions. So the trajectory of a basketball shot is going to be like a quadratic expression by factoring these I could figure out where those points are. So maybe that one is a great one that I could work with my students on because figuring out the trajectory is a quadratic expression. So this gives me some ideas as a teacher on how I could talk about this topic with my students, but in a way that's going to be more relevant and engaging for them. So being able to focus on those standards and skills I want students to work on, but bringing that relevancy to their day to day. I'm going to go back to the list that I have. And the last one that I want to bring up today because I'm just going to focus on three teacher tools is discussion prompts. So that's another one that we can build that engagement and foster discussion within the classroom to talk about discussion prompts. So I can click into that. And similarly, I can bring up grade level. So I'm going to do ninth grade. And I'm going to bring up that same standard that I just mentioned. So let's see. See how Comigo fares with giving me some discussion prompts so that we can engage and have that discourse in the classroom about it. So some ways I can talk about it exploring the relationships with factoring discussing different methods, as well as analyzing the role. So not only just having students work through a problem but being able to have that conversation in the classroom to see, do students understand that process? Do the students understand these terms? So you can have some time to also try these out. I'll switch back to the slides to show you these are the three tools that we recommend that you can focus on and direct your teachers to. So one, the Blickett generator is a more engaging way to do a formative assessment, especially given that it's end of March. To also help build student engagement using the make it relevant tool, the tie, what teachers are teaching in the classroom, those key standards skills that they're focused on and bringing that bringing it to life to something that interests students in the day to day. And then the last one is discussion prompts. We know that it's key that students are able to discuss have that discourse, especially for math. So that's a great one to be able to use in order to build that discussion. So I'd love for you all if you have your accounts open, you can try out these tools and think of is there one that you want to focus on and guide your teachers in using. Any questions or have you all been able to try out these these tools make it relevant discussion prompts. No, look at generator might be a bit hard to do in the timeframe that we have. You have a time have a chance to give it a shot and drop in the chat. How it goes for y'all. I'm going to continue on. We've talked about the teacher tools. Next, we want to really anchor in on being able to support our students. And then there are going to be two ways that students can use conmigo. One is going to be in those standalone activities. We can use tutor me math and science for that support to determine humanities. Those are going to be the two that I focus on. And then teachers can also assign those directly to students for that support. So I'm going to go back to my teacher dashboard. And then I'm going to go into the learner activities to try those out. As a teacher of access and as an administrator of access to try out these learner activities. So I'm going to start off with tutor me math and science. You can see as a student, you could go ahead on your own and give me get five practice problems focus on what you're working on for your homework. What's going to be really key if a teacher is wanting to use this as being able to assign it to students so that they are more focused on what they want to work on. And so the teachers will provide a title give the instructions and one day would use this. So I'm going to give another example of March madness with quadratics. I want the students to be able to factor expression work on five practice problems. And then as a teacher I can also preview this ahead of assigning to my students. I can even try it out so I'm ready to practice March madness with quadratics specific areas. So maybe I want to focus on like finding the zeros because that's where I'm really struggling with this. And then this is even helping me kind of think through as a tutor getting that support and understanding this and then I can dive into working on my five practice problems. So this is one way that teachers can leverage those conmigo assignments and students can have that dialogue with conmigo to better understand their approach and work on those five practice problems. It'll be key to highlight with teachers when they can be using this. So for example, this might be a great opportunity if first doing it whole group where a teacher will model how to use conmigo and asking those questions. Because the student might just go in default and just keep saying, I don't know, I don't know. But showing teach students the power and being able to ask questions if they're stuck and I don't actually know what what it means to find a zero. So what or what does it mean? What does it mean a factor because maybe I'm still not really understanding what that means or tying it to what I've seen in the classroom. So being able to see, OK, this is what it looks like to break it down or build out my expressions. And then from there, teachers can consider assigning this, for example, in their small groups, giving students that opportunity to practice that in the classroom, asking those questions and working through those problems. And again, this was tying it to the standards that I was working on. And you can see that conmigo was also kind of giving me those steps. But I also have to put some of that input into that. So another way that I as a teacher can leverage conmigo and Khan Academy. If I am looking for the standard, I can either go through the course. So, for example, I can go into the Algebra 1 course and I'm looking for a particular standard. I can also browse by standards to look for what I'm focused on. I'm in San Francisco. I'll focus on California, but you can also go to the Arizona State Standards and I can browse by my standards to find the particular one I want. So again, I was in Explore, browse by standards, went to my state and my particular course. So in this section, if I'm going to go down to scroll with quite a bit. But if I wanted to assign, maybe we're focused on the standard and I want to work on features of quadratic functions with my students to better understand their understanding of it. And it's what we're working on in the classroom now. They can go ahead and work on these problems and conmigos on the side here to help me as a student when we toggle over to the student mode in order to get support with this. So help me solve this. Try a similar example or why should I care about learning this? So I'm going to click on help me solve this. I'm going to keep it some time. So we'll begin to have that dialogue about it. Maybe I'm a bit stuck, not sure how to approach it, or I could have started on the work already and gotten some feedback from conmigo to get help with this. So again, this is an opportunity for your tier one instruction, finding that standard. I'm showing math examples, but you also have science. There's also ELA standards available as well and ELA courses to be able to help your students with that tier one instruction. So focusing on those skills or standards that you're working on now or that are coming up soon for your students to focus on. So giving you a few minutes to try this out. So going to explore finding a particular course that you want to have your students work in or that you want to direct your teachers to direct their students to. And have that opportunity to work through that problem, getting help from conmigo and asking those questions. And see Chandra had a question about the blue kit tool and I'm glad you're able to find that as a teacher, you can also see what the students will be able to see try to embed that quite a bit so that teachers before they assign anything or before they go forward, they can see what it's going to look like for the students. So that's why it's great administrators as teachers being able to try out the student experience as well and what it's like to ask me go those questions. So up to your teachers about using conmigo students have been working in next as administrators, it'll be key to be able to monitor that progress. So you go to your administrator dashboard, you'll be able to see that information on your dashboard skills to proficient as they level up their skills and demonstrate what they know. And I'm going to keep going down to this section about conmigo usage. I'll be able to see how many students are getting in, how many chats they're having. But also what will be really nice to focus on is what activities have they been using. So I'm seeing quite a few of my students are using it with an exercise as well as tutor me math and science as well as tutor me humanities. That could be great. That might be what I've been wanting them to focus on. I can also drill in further to see that information and see which exercises or which courses they've been leveraging. So Azure one sixth grade digital SAT math for me I'm excited because that those are the courses that I wanted my staff and students to be focused on. So for example, wanting them to be working in the biology course might be an opportunity to go and talk to that those staff members to see what additional support that they need to get their students in. And so as you're looking at your data. Two questions that I want you all to be thinking of is, when are you going to be reviewing that data or who on the team is reviewing that data, and then how are you going to share out this information. And then how do you look like celebrating it with your teachers if you notice that some of your teachers students are getting in and leveraging this to be able to support and learning, or maybe it's an opportunity to also follow up with staff that might not be getting out what they need help with. So I'm going to put those two questions up there for you all to consider. When are you taking that time to review that data. And as a reminder you all have district success managers who are here to support you so feel free to reach out to me and Francis as well for that additional support of what is my data look like where those highlights. Where those opportunities that we still have. And then as you're getting that information out, we celebrate doing celebration emails. Is it going to be in staff meetings PLCs, and we're also here to help you out with those templates if you need them and crafting those messages. If you're thinking of those, feel free to drop in the chat, what have you done. What are you starting to think about as you're considering these questions. Where do you still need support with this. Yep, I'm seeing Sarah would love some example templates so Francis and I will be able to follow up with the all with the templates that y'all can use. Absolutely. And then, next consider, I showed the activities report, I'll go back into the dashboard soon but you have an opportunity to also see your usage reports. And something else, another question for y'all to consider is, when will teachers have that time to share out with each other, how they're using con me go and where they can learn from each other. And it's still new for folks with using AI and con me go. And so in order to best support each other. It's really great for them to hear how are they using it, what's working well. So another question for y'all to consider when our teachers going to be doing this, then is this PLC time. This is going to be during principles meetings where folks can hear how folks are using these AI tools. This demo real quick going into the administrator dashboard on the left hand side under con me go. So we're currently on the activities report to see what they've used con me go for, you can then go into usage and see which classrooms have been using it. So actually go, let's see only show active students, and I can drill out into my high school and see particular classes that are using con me go. I can also toggle over to the teacher tab if I want to see specific teachers so it looks like I'm in my demo account. These teachers haven't been using it but hopefully you're seeing on your dashboards teachers that have been getting in and so they're teachers that you can talk to. Okay, and I'm seeing a few questions and comments in the chat. More form of PD at the beginning of next school year. Yeah, I understand we're nearing the end of the school year, you might already have things scheduled so we'd love to be able to have that conversation and start thinking of what is your PD schedule look like for next year's that we're set up, have a plan in place. And then a little bit Sanchez also bringing up like training for principals as well as an instructional coaches it's great to get those folks involved as well so they know what data they can look at, as well as how can they support their staff. And then, Maureen, if you can send a message to Francis with your email address as well as which district you're at so we can follow up on getting you access to the administrator reports for any other folks on the call your district partner or not seen the admin reports, feel free to reach out to us so that we can follow up with your district on getting you access. I'm excited to see folks considering PD is that support. And then it will be important also figure out that time for teachers to have reflection time with each other. If you have any questions with the learner activities that we've gone over as well as the reports that we've just covered. We'll move on to our next steps for you all to start thinking about. We have a couple of more learning series sessions or learning workshop sessions. So we just covered how to support your grade level learning with conmigo. The next section will be in two weeks on April 10 so supporting all learners. And the following one will be supporting summer learning can't believe summer is almost here. And then finally is right that towards the end of the school year and wanting to find opportunities to be able to celebrate that student success. So, make sure that those are on your calendar and that you'll be joining us for those additional learning series sessions. And a few of us are on the call today from your Khan Academy team so I'm joined by Chelsea as well as Francis. Other folks that you may have already met, or still to meet Cheryl is our rostering specialist so she can work with your IT folks to make sure that you have the proper folks that are rostered and getting into using Khan Academy and conmigo. Jennifer and India are wonderful professional learning specialists who are happy to support your district with scheduling professional learning. So, reach out to them to get that scheduled and get on the calendars. And so as we wind down and want to make sure to finish up with a quote from our founder, Sal Khan. So as we consider this big foray that we're making as technology plays a major role inside and outside the classroom you want to make sure that education innovation is accessible. So how do as we continue to see these advancements in technology like conmigo, how do we continue to bring that access and those opportunities for all students. And so we at Khan Academy by prioritizing AI and education. We are helping you all with fostering that inclusive learning. And so continue to join us in that conversation of how do we empower every learner to thrive in a rapid and evolving digital landscape. So with that, we look forward to our next session with you all. I'm going to drop a few links in the chat for you. One is a talk that covers some of those tools that we have talked about, including a video about Blugit and some other videos that you can see to help you with reports understanding the learner activities, know that we'll also follow up with you all on some of the templates to be able to use to celebrate success and email out. I'm also including some of these asynchronous free courses that are available to you all already. These are especially focused on the on the courses that educators have. And then Chelsea is mentioning if you're not currently a district partner and are interested to learn more, feel free to reach out to her she's dropped her email address in the chat. Frances has also dropped hers and for any of my partners that I am working with as a reminder. I'm dropping my email in the chat so if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. So Chelsea, if you're not currently a district partner and interested to learn more, and for our current partners, feel free to reach out to Frances and myself to talk more about those templates, talk more about your implementation and start scheduling professional learning. I'll hang out here if you have any questions. Feel free to drop them in the chat. Thank you so much for joining us today to talk about how you can use Connego to support your on grade level learning with your students.
