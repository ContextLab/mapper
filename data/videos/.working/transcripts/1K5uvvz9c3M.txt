The Empire State Building, the Sears Tower, the Canadian National Tower, each of these structures was the tallest in the world at the time they were built or no error. So let's see. They list a bunch of structures here, the Empire State Building, the Sears Tower, the Canadian National Tower, and then they talk about each of these structures. So really, they're talking about a singular subject right over here. If they said all of these structures, then we would talk about we'd have a plural subject. But they're saying, hey, take one of these at a time, each of these structures. And so that makes sense that this is was because was would be the singular form of the verb. Each of these structures was. If this was all of these structures, then we would put a were there. They say each of these structures was the tallest in the world at the time they were built. Now, this is interesting. This is a singular subject, singular verb. That makes sense. But then we shouldn't be referring to they now. We're talking about each of the structures. So it was really at the time it was built. At the time it was built. Remember, we're talking about each of the structures taken individually. So each of these structures was the tallest in the world at the time it was built. If you wanted to say they were built, you would have to say all of these structures were the tallest in the world at the time they were built. But we don't have the option of changing each to the all right over here. So since we're talking about a singular subject, we would keep the was. And instead of they were, it would be an it was. So let's just read the whole thing over again. The Empire State Building, the Sears Tower, the Canadian National Tower, each of these structures was the tallest in the world at the time it was built. Yep, error in part D.
