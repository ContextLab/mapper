In 2014, the population of the United States was about 318,900,000 people. Choose the best approximation of the United States population in 2014. So they say three times 10 to the eighth people or three times 10 to the ninth people. This is a big difference. This is a factor of 10. This is 10 times this right over here. So which one's closer? So if I were to round this to the nearest 100 million, this would go to 300 million. And 300 million, this is three times 100 million. So this is the same thing as three times 100 million. And 100 million, we see has eight zeros. So this is the same thing as three times 10 to the eighth. Three times 10 to the eighth power, which they have right over here. Three times 10 to the ninth, that would be three billion. That would be almost 10 times as large as this. So we would definitely want to go with this one. Three times 10 to the eighth people is a pretty good approximation. This is 300 million people. So we're kind of rounding to the nearest 100 million. In 2014, the population of the world was about 7 billion, 125 million people. Choose the best approximation of the world population in 2014. Well here we're dealing with, this is billions here. So let me just round to the nearest billion. So we could say this is roughly 7 billion. Seven, seven, so approximately 7 billion if we're rounding to the nearest billion. And a billion is 10 to the ninth. We see we have nine zeros here. So this is going to be equal to seven times 10 to the ninth power, which is this right over here. This would be 700 million. This is less than a tenth of the actual world population. This is seven billion, which is if you're rounding to the nearest billion, how many people there were in 2014. Approximately how many times larger was the world population, how many times larger was the world population than the United States population in 2014? Well what was the world population? If we're trying to end, once again, we're saying approximately. They're saying two, 20, 200. So if we're saying approximately, you see the world population, if we're using the approximation, was seven times 10 to the ninth power. And the United States population, we said it was roughly in 2014, three times 10 to the eighth. So we could divide this, we could divide this. We could divide the world population, or approximation of the world population, by our approximation of the United States population. So our approximation of the world population divided by the approximation of the United States population, three times 10 to the eighth power. Well what's that going to be? This is going to be approximately, well this is actually going to be exactly 7 thirds. So we could say, so seven divided by three, that's 7 thirds times, what's 10 to the ninth divided by 10 to the eighth power? Well that's just going to be 10. 10 to the ninth is 10 to the eighth times 10. And if we divide that by 10 to the eighth, we're just going to be left with 10. Or if we think about exponent properties, we have the same base, 10 to the ninth, divided by 10 to the eighth. You can subtract this, the exponent in the denominator, from the exponent in the numerator. So it's going to be 10 to the nine minus eight power, 10 to the first, this is going to be times 10. Well that's not exactly what they have over here, but we see 7 thirds, this is 2 1 third times 10. So we could say this is equal to 2 1 third times 10, which is approximately equal to, which is approximately equal to 2 times 10. If we're just rounding, once again, this is all for the sake of roughness, which is 20. Which is 20, which is that right over there.
