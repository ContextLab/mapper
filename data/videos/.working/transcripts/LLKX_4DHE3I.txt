In its most popular sense, when people talk about mitosis, they're referring to a cell, a diploid cell. So diploid just means it has its full complement of chromosomes, so it has 2n chromosomes. So that's the nucleus. This is the whole cell. And so most people are saying, look, the cell itself replicates into two diploid cells. So it turns into two cells, each that have a full complement of chromosomes. And so when people say a cell has experienced mitosis, they normally mean this. But I want to make one slight clarification that formally, mitosis only refers to the process of the replication of the genetic material and the nucleus. So for example, if I were to draw this, let me draw the cell, and it has now two nucleuses, each with the diploid number of chromosomes. This cell has experienced mitosis. It has not experienced cytokinesis, which we will talk about in a few moments. But that's the process of the actual cytoplasm of the cell being split into two different cells. And just as a clarity, the cytoplasm is all the stuff outside of the nucleus. So I'll talk about that in a second. But just know in everyday usage, this is normally the case when people talk about mitosis. But if you've got a teacher that likes to get you on a technicality, this is technically what mitosis is. It's the splitting of the nucleus, or the replication of the nucleus, into two separate nucleuses that's normally accompanied by cytokinesis, where the cytoplasms of the cells actually separate. Now with that said, let's go into the mechanics of mitosis. So the first steps that are really necessary for mitosis actually occur outside of mitosis, when the cell is just doing its day-to-day life. And that's during the interphase. And the interphase, literally, it's not a phase of mitosis. It's literally when the cell is just living. So the cell, let's say we have some new cell. Let me do it in green. So I have some new cell here. Maybe this is its nucleus. It's got 2N chromosomes. And then it grows. It brings in nutrients from the outside and builds proteins and does whatever. So it grows a bit. It's obviously got its full chromosomal complement still. And then at some point during this life cycle, and I'll label these actually, so this phase and interphase, and this might not even be covered in some biology classes, they give it a label. They call it G1, which is really just when the cell is growing. It's just growing, accumulating materials, and building itself out. And then it actually replicates its chromosomes. So you still have a diploid number of chromosomes. So let me zoom in. So let me draw this. This is called the S phase of interphase. This is S. And S is where you have replication of the actual chromosomes. Once again, we're not even in mitosis yet. So S, you have replication of your chromosomes. So if I were to zoom in on the nucleus during the S phase, if I were to start off, let me just start with some organism that has two chromosomes. So let's say that at the beginning of S phase, and I'll draw things as chromosomes just to make it clear that things are being replicated. So let me say it has this chromosome right here. And then let's say it has this chromosome right here. As it goes through S phase, these chromosomes replicate. And I'm just drawing the nucleus here. I've zoomed in on just this part right here, where N is one, where two, our full diploid complement, is two chromosomes. During S phase, our chromosomes will replicate. So that green one will completely replicate and generate a copy of itself. And we've learned this a little bit. They're connected at the centromere. Now each of those copies are called chromatids. And that magenta one will do the same thing. Now even though we have here, you can kind of say we have two chromatids, one for each chromosome. Now we have four chromatids, two for each chromosome. We still say we only have two chromosomes. And that's its centromere right now. This occurs in the S phase. And then the cell will just continue to grow more. So the cell was already big. I'll focus on the cell again. The cell was already big. And it gets bigger. And that's during the G2 phase. So it's just growing more. Now there's another little part of the cell that we haven't even talked about yet. But I'll talk about it a little bit. It's super duper important. But this is an idea of the centrosomes. And these are going to be very important later on when the cell is actually dividing. And those also duplicate. So let's say I have a little centrosome here. It has centrioles inside it. You don't have to worry too much about that. But there's these little cylindrical looking things. So you don't get confused if you see the word centriole and centrosomes. Not to be confused with centromere, which are these little points where the two chromatids attach. Unfortunately, they've named many things in this process very similarly, or a lot of the kind of parts of a cell very similarly. But you have these things called centrosomes that are going to enter the picture very soon that are sitting outside of the nucleus. And they also replicate during the interphase. So you had one before, now you have two of them. And of course, they each have their two little centrioles inside, where we're not going to focus too much on those just yet. So that's what happened in the interphase. Now the cell, and this is most of the cell's life. And it's kind of growing and doing what it wants. And actually, I'll make a slight point here. When I drew the DNA here, I drew them as chromosomes. But the reality is, is when we're sitting in the interphase, this is not what the DNA would actually look like. The DNA, if I were to actually draw this, it's in its chromatin form. It's not all tightly wound like I drew here. I drew it tightly wound so that you can see that it got replicated. But the reality is that green chromosome was actually all unwound. And if you were looking at a microscope, you would even have trouble seeing it. And this is its chromatin form. And we'll talk a little bit about where it actually organizes itself back into a chromosome. But in this chromatin form, it's just a bunch of DNA and proteins that the DNA is wrapped around a little bit. So you might have some proteins here that the DNA is wrapped around a little bit. But if you're looking at a microscope, it just looks like a big blur of DNA and proteins. And same thing for the magenta molecule. And really, for DNA to do anything, it has to be like this, it has to kind of be open to its environment in order for the mRNA and the different types of helper proteins to really be able to function with it. And even for it to be able to replicate, it has to be unwound like this in order to function. It only gets tightly wound like this later on. I just drew it like this. So really, it had one green one, and it's going to replicate to form another green one. They're going to be attached at some point. And that magenta one's going to replicate to form another magenta one. And they'll be attached at some point. But it's not going to be clear. I just drew it this way to show that it really happened. This is the reality. It's in its chromatin form. Now, we're ready for mitosis. So the first stage of mitosis is essentially, well, let me draw this. So I'll draw the cell in green. And I'm going to draw the nucleus a little bit, well, a lot bigger than it normally is relative to the cell, just because at least right now, a lot of the action is going on in the nucleus. So the first stage of mitosis is the prophase. And these are somewhat arbitrary names that were assigned to people who looked at a microscope. Oh, that's a certain type of step that we always see when a nucleus is dividing. So we'll call this the prophase. What happens in the prophase is that the actual chromatin starts actually turning into this type of form. So as I just said, when we're in the interface, the DNA is in this form, where it's all separated and unwound, it actually starts to wind together. So this is where you'll actually have, and remember, it's already replicated. The replication happened before mitosis begins. So I had that one chromosome there, and then I have another one here. It has two sister chromatids that we'll see soon get pulled apart. Now, during prophase, you also start to have these centromeres appear that I was touching on before. These guys over here, they start to facilitate the generation of these what you call microtubules. And you can view these as these sticks or these ropes that are going to be key in moving things around as we divide the cell. And all of this is pretty amazing. You think of a cell, you think of something that's inherently pretty simple. It's kind of the most basic living structure in us or in life, but even here you have these complex mechanics going on, and a lot of it still isn't understood. We can observe it, but we really don't know what's happening at the atomic level or at the protein level that allows these things to move around in such a nicely choreographed way. It's still an area of research. Some of this is understood, some of it isn't. But you have these two centrosomes and they facilitate the development of these microtubules, which are literally like these little microstructures. You can view them as tubes or as some type of rope. Now, as prophase progresses, it eventually gets to the point where let me do it. I don't want this word replication written here. It makes it confusing. Let me delete that. Let me get rid of this replication. So as prophase progresses, the nuclear envelope actually disappears. So let me redraw this. Let me copy and paste what I've done before. Put it there. As prophase progresses, I'm using too thick of a hole, there you go, the nuclear envelope actually starts to disassemble. So this starts to actually dissolve and disassemble. And then these things start to grow and attach themselves to the centrome here. So actually let me do that. So this is all during prophase. And since all of this happens during prophase, this latter part of prophase, sometimes they'll call it late prophase, sometimes it'll be called pro-metaphase. Actually, let me do that. Let me write that down. Pro-metaphase. Sometimes it's considered, I don't think there's a hyphen really there. Pro-metaphase. So sometimes it's actually considered a separate phase of mitosis, although when I learned in school they didn't bother with pro-metaphase, they just called it all prophase. But by the end of prophase, or actually by the end of pro-metaphase, depending on how you want to view it, the whole situation is going to look something like this. You have your overall cell. The nuclear envelope has disassembled, so to some degree it doesn't exist anymore, although the proteins that formed it are still there and they're going to be used later on. And you have your two chromosomes. In this case, in a human's case, you would have 46 of them. You have your two chromosomes, each made with sister chromatids. They, of course, have their centromeres, or they're right there. And then these centrosomes will have migrated roughly on opposite sides of what was once the nucleus. And these things have kind of spread apart, these microtubules. So they're doing two functions. They're doing two functions. At this point, they're kind of pushing these two centrosomes apart. So you have all of these things and they're connecting. Some of them are coming from this centrosome, some are coming from this centrosome, some are connecting the two. And then some of these microtubules, these tubes or these ropes, however you want to view them, attach themselves to the centromeres of the actual chromosomes. And the protein structure is going to be a little bit different. The protein structure that they attach them to is called the kinetochore. So there's kinetochore there and that may or may not be kinetochore. It's a protein structure. It's actually fascinating. It's still an open area of research on how exactly the microtubule attaches to the kinetochore. And as we'll see in a second, it's at the kinetochore that the microtubules essentially start to pull at the two separate sister chromatids and actually pull them apart. And it's actually not understood exactly how that works, it's just been observed that this actually happens. Once prophase is done, essentially the cells then just make sure that the chromosomes are well aligned. I mean, I kind of drew them well aligned here. But that kind of formally occurs during metaphase, which is the next phase. So the first one was prophase, now we're in metaphase. And metaphase really is just an aligning of the chromosomes. So all of the chromosomes are going to be aligned at the center of the cell. So I have my magenta one here, I have my magenta one here, and I have my other one here, my green one there. And of course, you have your centrosomes, the microspindles that are coming off of them. Some of them are kinetochore microspindles, they're actually attaching to the centromeres of the actual chromosomes. It's very confusing, right? The centrosomes are the structures that help direct what happens to these microtubules. Centrioles are these little can-shaped structures inside the centrosomes. And the centromere are the center points where the two chromatids attached to each other within a chromosome. So this is one sister chromatid, that's another sister chromatid, and they attach at the centromere. But this is metaphase. It's fairly easy. Metaphase, you just have this aligning of the cells, and there's actually some theories, how does the cell know to progress past this point? How does it know that everything is aligned and attached? And then there's some theories that there's actually some signaling mechanism that if one of these kinetochore proteins aren't properly attached to one of these ropes, that somehow a signal is sent that mitosis should not continue. So this is a very intricate process. Now you can imagine if you have 46 chromosomes and you have all of this stuff going on in the cell, and it's not like there's some individual pushing stuff or some computer here, it's all being really directed by chemistry and thermodynamic processes. But just by the intricacy or I guess the elegance of how these things are, it happens spontaneously with all of the proper checks and balances so that most of the time nothing bad happens, which is all quite amazing. So after metaphase, now we're ready to pull the stuff apart, and that's anaphase. So in anaphase, I've changed the color of my cell, these guys get pulled apart. And as soon as they get pulled apart, so let's see, this guy is getting pulled, let me do it in green. So one of the sister chromatids is pulled in that direction, one is getting pulled in that direction, and then same is true for the magenta one. Pull in that direction, one is getting pulled in that direction. And of course you have your centrosomes here, and then they're connected to the kinetochores that are right there, and that's where the pulling, and there's also a whole microtubule structure that aren't connected to the actual chromosomes, but they're helping to actually push apart these two centrosomes so that everything is going to opposite sides of the cell. And so as soon as these two chromatids are separated, and I touched on this a little bit before when we talked about the vocabulary of DNA, then as soon as that happens, these are each referred to as chromosomes. So now you can say that the cell has what it used to have here, it has two chromosomes, it now has four chromosomes. Because as soon as a chromatid is no longer connected to its sister chromatid, they're then considered sister chromosomes, which is just a naming convention. I mean, they were there before, they were there after, they were just attached before. Now they're not attached, so you kind of consider them their own individual entity. And then we're almost done. The last stage is telophase. And I'm going to draw the cell a little bit different here, because something is happening simultaneously with telophase most of the time. So telophase, and actually I'll rotate the cell 90 degrees. Let's say that this was one centromere. This is the other centromere. So at this point, it's essentially pulled the DNA to itself, so this guy has pulled one copy of that chromosome, and one copy of this chromosome. And that guy's done the same up here. He's pulled over one copy of each, I use a different color, one copy of each chromosome to himself. Let me draw that right there, like that. And now the nuclear membranes start forming around each of these two ends. So now you start having a nuclear membrane form around each of these two ends. And so by the end of the telophase, that's what we're in, the telophase, we will have completed mitosis. We will have completely replicated our two original nucleuses and all of the genetic content inside of it. Now at the same time that telophase is happening, you also normally have this cytokinesis, where this cleavage furrow forms, where essentially during telophase, these things are getting pushed further and further apart by those microtubules, so that they're already at the ends of the cell, at the cytoplasm of the cell, and you can almost see them as pushing on the sides to elongate the cell. And as that is happening, you have this furrow forming, this little indentation. And by the end of telophase and mitosis, you also have this process of cytokinesis, where this cleavage furrow forms and deepens, deepens, deepens, until the cytoplasm is actually split into two separate cells. So this is cytokinesis, which is formally not a part of mitosis, cytokinesis, but it normally occurs with the telophase, so right at the end of mitosis, you do normally have two complete identical cells. And then once you have each of these two cells, then they each individually enter their own interphase, or they each individually, if we look at just this one, he will then be in his G1 phase. And at some point, these two things are going to replicate in the S phase, you go to G2 phase, and then this guy will experience mitosis all over again.
