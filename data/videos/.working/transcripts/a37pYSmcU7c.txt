We're told a sequence is defined by f of n is equal to 1 5th times f of n minus one. So each term, whatever the value of the function is there, where the sequence is for that term, it's 1 5th times the previous term. For each whole number n, where n is greater than one, and then they also tell us which we need, what the first term is, f of one is equal to 50. Now the reason I have this graph here is what I want you to do is pause this video and figure out what the value of this function is for n equals one, two, three, and four. And then we're gonna be able to graph this together and think about what that graph looks like and why. All right, now let's do this together. And what I like to do is set up a table here. We're on this left column, I have n, and then over here I have f of n on the right column. And so let's first start with n equals one. Well, they already tell us that f of one is equal to 50. And if we want, we can plot that when n is equal to one. And I should say that this is the n-axis instead of the x-axis. When n is equal to one, f of one is 50 right over here. So let's call this the y is equal to f of n-axis. All right, let's do the next one. I'll do that in red. When n is equal to two, well, f of two is going to be equal to, it says it right over here, 1 5th times f of two minus one, or 1 5th times f of one. So I could just write that as 1 5th times f of one, which is equal to 1 5th times 50, which is equal to 10. So when n is equal to two, this is equal to 10 right over here, f of two is 10. And then now let's go to when n is equal to three, f of three, I think you see the pattern here, is equal to 1 5th times f of two, times f of two, we know what f of two is, it's 10. So it's equal to 1 5th times 10, which is equal to two. So when n is equal to three, y is equal to f of n is equal to two, which is right about there. And then last but not least, then an orange, when n is equal to four, f of four is equal to 1 5th times f of three, the previous term, which is equal to 1 5th times two, which is equal to 2 5ths. So that's less than one, so it's gonna be just right above zero like that. And so we have graphed those four points, and you might see an interesting pattern here. You might say, hey, you know what, this looks a lot like exponential decay. And that's not a coincidence, because remember every term here, it's 1 5th times the previous term. So we're decaying, we're multiplying each successive term by 1 5th, it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller. But that's what we're seeing here when we're dealing with a geometric sequence. Now in this particular scenario, we defined this geometric sequence recursively. Each successive term, we've defined it in terms of the previous term, and then we got a starting condition. There's other ways to define a geometric series so that it is not recursive, but it's good to get exposure to this. So generally speaking, if you have each successive term is going to be some multiple of the previous term, here it's a multiple less than one, it could be multiple greater than one, you're going to have points that look like they're on some type of exponential curve. If on the other hand, you had an arithmetic sequence where each successive term is plus or minus some fixed amount of the previous term, then it will look more linear.
