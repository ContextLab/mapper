We're told that Nieria earns $75 for four hours of tutoring. How much does Nieria earn for one hour of tutoring? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. Well, the key here is $75 for four hours of tutoring. And there's a couple of ways you can think about it. The ratio here is $75 for every four hours. So if you wanted one hour of tutoring, well, it's just going to be 1 4th of the $75, or you could just take 75 and divide by four. Another way you could think about it, you could say Nieria gets $75 for every four hours, which is another way of saying that Nieria is going to earn $75 divided by $4 per hour. So really, we just have to figure out what 75 divided by four is. So let's do a little bit of long division. So four goes into seven, one times four is four. We're going to subtract seven minus four is three. Bring down that five. Four goes into 35. Eight times, eight times four is 32. I will subtract again. I get a three. Well, now I'm going to get some decimals here. So let me bring down a zero. Four goes into 30, seven times. Seven times four is 28, subtract. And then I get a two. Bring down another zero. Four goes into 20, five times. Five times four is 20, and I am done. No more remainder here. So we get that Nieria earns $18.75 per hour. $25 per hour. Or you can just say that she makes $18.75 per hour.
