Hello grammarians, broadly we're talking about irregular verbs, but more specifically today we're gonna talk about the EN ending, which is why I'm calling this lecture taken for a ride, because this little EN thing. So we've spoken previously about verbs that show their past tense or their past perfect or past participle forms by changing their vowel sound, like the verb to sing, right? Present tense sing, past tense sang, past perfect aspect, had sung. So some of the words we're going to be talking about today also have that vowel change, but what's different about them is that for the past perfect or past participle form, instead of ED, it's EN. Let me explain. The verb to tear, right? In its present tense, it's tear, I tear this piece of paper. Past tense, I tore this piece of paper, and in the past perfect, it's I had torn. I probably shouldn't have done that, I had notes on that paper. Some verbs that fall into the category of the EN past perfect have regular seeming past tenses. So for example, the word show, I show him the book, she showed me the book, we had shown them the book. So we're still getting this n sound. Same thing goes with prove. The present tense, prove, past tense, proved, past perfect, proven. Same deal for the verb to bite. I bite, it bit, I was bitten, or it had bitten. The present tense of to ride is ride, the past is road, and the past perfect or past participle is had written or was written, as in the horse was written all around the countryside. The verb to eat works this way. Present tense, eat, past tense, ate, past participle, or past perfect, is had eaten or was eaten. So I had eaten earlier, or the cookie was eaten by stew. The verb speak undergoes that vowel shift, so it goes speak in the present tense, spoke in the past tense, and past participle or past perfect is spoken. Even really weird words like to be and to go obey this rule, the en rule. It just doesn't necessarily look like it. So to be, the past of that is either was or were, but the past perfect form of that is bin, which is just be with an in ending on it, right? Go is the same way. So even though go has a really weird past form, I go, she went, the past perfect or past participle form is gone. And sure, the letters aren't in the right order, but the sound is there, gone. Irregular verbs are weird. There's no denying it, but we can break them down and they can be understood, and you can learn anything. David out.
