        "D": "Mitochondria produce the CO₂ that chloroplasts require as their primary carbon substrate for the Calvin cycle, and chloroplasts in turn produce the O₂ that mitochondria consume in oxidative phosphorylation, forming a necessary closed metabolic loop within each plant cell that ensures neither organelle becomes limited by its gaseous substrates"

        "A": "Bacteria are much smaller than human cells, giving them a dramatically higher surface-area-to-volume ratio that allows antibiotics to penetrate their plasma membranes far more easily — this size-dependent permeability difference is the primary basis for selective toxicity, as human cells are simply too large for antibiotic molecules to reach effective intracellular concentrations",
        "B": "Bacteria have cell walls made of peptidoglycan — a structure entirely absent in human cells — and penicillin specifically blocks peptidoglycan synthesis, destroying the bacterial wall while leaving human cells unaffected",
        "C": "Human cells have a more efficient innate immune defense system that actively neutralizes antibiotic molecules before they can accumulate to damaging intracellular concentrations",
        "D": "Human cells store antibiotics in specialized lysosomes where acidic hydrolases rapidly degrade the drug molecules before they can interact with cellular targets, whereas bacteria lack this lysosomal detoxification pathway and cannot break down or sequester antibiotic compounds, leaving them fully exposed to the drug's effects"

      "options": {
        "A": "Valine is much larger than glutamic acid in terms of its van der Waals radius and steric volume, causing severe steric clashes with neighboring amino acid residues in the β-globin chain that prevent hemoglobin from folding into its normal quaternary structure — these misfolded hemoglobin molecules aggregate into insoluble inclusion bodies that mechanically deform the red blood cell membrane into the characteristic sickle shape",
        "B": "Glutamic acid is hydrophilic and charged, while valine is hydrophobic — this creates a 'sticky' hydrophobic patch on the hemoglobin surface that causes deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules to polymerize into rigid fibers, distorting the cell into a sickle shape",
        "C": "The substitution eliminates hemoglobin's ability to bind molecular oxygen entirely, causing the cell to collapse under osmotic stress as dehydration concentrates the intracellular contents",
        "D": "Valine at position 6 forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with a cysteine residue on neighboring hemoglobin molecules, cross-linking adjacent hemoglobin tetramers into rigid crystalline arrays within the red blood cell — these disulfide-bonded hemoglobin crystals are incompatible with the biconcave disk shape and force the cell into an elongated sickle configuration"

      "options": {
        "A": "Mitochondria synthesize all of their own proteins using their internal ribosomal machinery inherited from the ancestral α-proteobacterial endosymbiont, but they also maintain redundant backup copies of every mitochondrial gene in the host cell nucleus as a fail-safe mechanism — if mitochondrial DNA is damaged by reactive oxygen species generated during oxidative phosphorylation, the nuclear backup copies can be transcribed and their protein products imported into mitochondria to maintain respiratory chain function",
        "B": "Over evolutionary time, most genes from the ancestral endosymbiotic α-proteobacterium were transferred to the host nucleus through endosymbiotic gene transfer, while a small core of genes — primarily those encoding highly hydrophobic membrane-embedded electron transport chain subunits — were retained because they are difficult to import across mitochondrial membranes",
        "C": "The nuclear genome originally contained all the genes necessary for mitochondrial function before the endosymbiotic event, and mitochondria later acquired a small subset of genes through horizontal gene transfer from environmental bacteria",
        "D": "Mitochondrial DNA encodes all essential mitochondrial proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, and mitochondrial gene expression, while the nuclear-encoded proteins targeted to mitochondria are merely supplementary factors that modulate but are not essential for any core mitochondrial metabolic functions — this explains why mitochondrial DNA mutations have such severe phenotypic effects in mitochondrial diseases"

      "options": {
        "A": "DNA methylation only affects intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and transposable element sequences scattered throughout the genome and has no influence whatsoever on gene promoters or regulatory elements — the observed correlation between promoter methylation and gene silencing is an artifact of bisulfite sequencing protocols that cannot distinguish between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, the latter of which is actually associated with active transcription",
        "B": "Transcription factors require continuous physical presence at the promoter to maintain gene expression states, and their effects are immediately reversed when the transcription factor is degraded or sequestered — whereas DNA methylation is fundamentally different because it is transient, lasting only minutes before demethylase enzymes remove the methyl groups, requiring constant re-methylation by de novo methyltransferases",
        "C": "DNA methylation is mitotically heritable — maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1) recognizes hemimethylated CpG sites after replication and methylates the daughter strand, perpetuating the silencing pattern through cell divisions without requiring the original inducing signal",
        "D": "DNA methylation works by physically severing the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA double helix at methylated cytosine residues, creating single-strand breaks that prevent RNA polymerase from transcribing through the methylated region — these breaks are repaired when the gene needs to be reactivated, restoring the intact template"

      "options": {
        "A": "Each cell type along the body axis requires a specific absolute number of morphogen molecules (not a concentration) bound to its surface receptors, and random Poisson fluctuations in the stochastic arrival of individual morphogen molecules at each cell create sharp boundaries between adjacent cell fates by partitioning cells into discrete groups that received exactly the required number of molecules during a critical developmental time window — this stochastic counting mechanism explains why embryonic pattern formation is remarkably robust despite molecular noise",
        "B": "Different target genes have enhancers with different binding affinities for the morphogen — high-affinity enhancers are activated at low concentrations (far from the source), while low-affinity enhancers require high concentrations (near the source), creating concentration-dependent thresholds that are sharpened by mutual cross-repression between the induced genes",
        "C": "The morphogen physically blocks cell migration at specific concentration thresholds by cross-linking surface adhesion molecules, creating mechanical barriers between adjacent cell populations",
        "D": "Sharp boundaries between cell types arise because the morphogen is released from the source in discrete temporal pulses rather than as a continuous steady-state gradient — each pulse activates a different set of target genes depending on the cell's distance from the source, creating a temporal code that converts a graded spatial signal into a series of discrete activation events separated by refractory periods"

        "B": "Bacteria at high cell density physically contact each other through their outer membrane surfaces, and mechanosensitive ion channels embedded in the inner membrane transduce this mechanical pressure into an intracellular calcium signal that activates a phosphorylation cascade culminating in the transcriptional induction of the lux operon — this contact-dependent signaling mechanism explains why bioluminescence requires a minimum cell density and why dispersed individual cells never luminesce regardless of culture conditions",
        "C": "Each cell constitutively produces a small, membrane-permeable autoinducer (acyl-homoserine lactone, AHL) that accumulates in proportion to cell density — above a threshold concentration, AHL binds the LuxR transcription factor intracellularly, and the LuxR-AHL complex activates lux operon transcription, creating a cooperative density-dependent switch",

        "B": "Eukaryotic genomes are far too large and complex, with extensive intron sequences, repetitive elements, and heterochromatin packaging, to accommodate the insertion of foreign prokaryotic genes without disrupting essential regulatory elements — the sheer size and organizational complexity of eukaryotic chromosomes creates an insurmountable barrier to stable integration of horizontally transferred DNA",
        "C": "Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane, making their genomic DNA freely accessible in the cytoplasm to foreign DNA molecules that enter through conjugation, transformation, or transduction — this direct physical accessibility is the primary factor enabling horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes",

      "options": {
        "A": "Oxygen reacts with carbon dioxide in the mitochondrial matrix to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into protons and bicarbonate ions that contribute to maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane during periods of high metabolic demand for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation in actively respiring cells",
        "B": "Oxygen donates high-energy electrons to Complex I at the very beginning of the electron transport chain, initiating the entire cascade of electron transfers that sequentially pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space through the three proton-pumping complexes — Complex I, Complex III, and Complex IV — generating the electrochemical gradient",
        "C": "Oxygen activates ATP synthase by binding directly to its regulatory gamma subunit, changing the enzyme's conformation from an inactive closed state to an active open state that permits proton flow through the c-ring rotor mechanism and thereby enables the catalytic synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate at the three catalytic beta subunits",
        "D": "Oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor at Complex IV — it accepts electrons at the end of the transport chain and combines with protons to form water. Without oxygen to accept electrons, the chain backs up completely because every carrier remains reduced and cannot accept new electrons from upstream donors"

These processes rapidly clear the neurotransmitter, ending receptor stimulation",
        "B": "The electrical resistance of the synaptic cleft increases over time, blocking further signal transmission regardless of neurotransmitter presence",
        "C": "Postsynaptic receptors permanently desensitize after a single binding event and must be entirely replaced by newly synthesized receptor proteins manufactured in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the membrane before the neuron can respond to another stimulus. This complete receptor turnover process takes approximately 24-48 hours, which is why neurons have a refractory period between successive activations that limits the maximum firing frequency",

      "options": {
        "A": "A small, remote island far from the mainland, because geographic isolation prevents competition from mainland species and allows extensive adaptive radiation into unfilled ecological niches without interference from immigrant species that might outcompete endemic forms attempting to diversify into new habitats on the isolated island",
        "B": "A large island near the mainland — larger islands support more species because they have lower extinction rates (more habitat, larger populations, more niches), and proximity to the mainland increases immigration rates. The equilibrium species number is highest when immigration is high and extinction is low",
        "C": "A medium-sized island at intermediate distance from the mainland, because the theory predicts a peak in species richness at intermediate values of both area and isolation due to nonlinear interaction between immigration and extinction rate curves at their optimal intersection point where both processes reach equilibrium simultaneously",
        "D": "A very small island directly adjacent to the mainland, because the extremely high immigration rate overwhelms any extinction effects and drives species richness toward the total mainland species pool size regardless of island area, available resources, habitat diversity, or any other ecological factor that might otherwise limit species number"

        "B": "The toolkit genes independently evolved identical sequences in each animal phylum through convergent molecular evolution driven by identical selective pressures in the developmental environment, rather than being inherited from a common ancestor that already possessed these developmental regulators. This convergent origin explains why the protein sequences are similar despite the phyla having diverged hundreds of millions of years ago",

        "A": "The neutral theory predicts that functionally constrained regions of the genome like essential protein-coding sequences will evolve faster than unconstrained regions like pseudogenes, because neutral mutations are preferentially targeted to important genomic regions by a molecular mechanism that selectively increases local mutation rates at sites under the strongest purifying selection pressure, concentrating evolutionary change where functional consequences are greatest",
        "B": "The neutral theory predicts a roughly constant rate of molecular evolution (a 'molecular clock') for a given protein across different lineages, because the rate of neutral substitution equals the neutral mutation rate — which is independent of population size, generation time, and selection intensity. This clock-like behavior has been broadly confirmed for many proteins and is the basis of molecular dating techniques in phylogenetics",

This non-specific mechanical barrier provides broad-spectrum protection against all phage types regardless of their surface recognition specificity, and the increased wall thickness is heritable because the genes controlling peptidoglycan synthesis are permanently upregulated",
        "C": "During initial infection, the bacterium integrates short fragments of phage DNA (protospacers) into its CRISPR array as new spacers between repeated sequences. In subsequent infections, these spacers are transcribed and processed into guide RNAs (crRNAs) that direct Cas nucleases to complementary sequences in invading phage DNA, cleaving it and neutralizing the threat.

For transgenerational inheritance to occur, marks must survive both erasure events.
