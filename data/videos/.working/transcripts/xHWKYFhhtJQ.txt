I now want to show you that the standard algorithm for multiplying numbers can also be used, it's not just limited to base 10, it can also be used, frankly it can be used at any base, but we're going to do it in base two. And base two is especially fun, because you essentially have to only know your multiplication tables through one. So you just have to know that zero times zero is zero, one times zero is zero, and that one times one is one. And then you're ready to go, you're ready to multiply in base two. So let's do that. So let's say we have, let's take, let's say we take nine. So let's see, nine is gonna be one eight zero fours, zero twos, and one. So this is nine right over here, represented in base two. And let's say we were to multiply that times, let's say we were to multiply that times seven. So we should obviously, if we know our multiplication tables, we should get 63. So seven is one, actually I'm gonna put a zero in, seven would be one one one, but that's a little bit boring. So let's instead do, let's do nine times five, which we know should be 45. So this is one four, no twos, and one one. So four plus one is gonna be five. So this is nine times five, and we're doing it in base two. So once again, same algorithm. And actually, before I do it, I encourage you to just pause the video and try to use the same algorithm that you've used for base 10 multiplication, use the same algorithm here, and let's see if we actually do get that nine times five is 45. So I'm assuming you've had a go at it, let's work through it together. So let's start right over here in the ones place. So we multiply one times one is one, one times zero is zero, one times zero is zero, one times one is one. Then we can go to the twos place, and since we're multiplying all of this times the twos place, we can throw a zero right over here. But of course, zero times each of these is just gonna be a bunch of zeros. So we, you know, zero times one is zero, zero times zero is zero, zero times zero is zero, zero times one is zero. So I really didn't have to write that, but I'm just doing it so that you see that I'm using the standard algorithm. And then we go to the fours place. And since we're in the fours place, let's put some zeros here. So zero, zero. We're essentially figuring out, we're essentially talking about a certain number of fours, not a certain number of ones. So one times that is just gonna be one, zero, zero, one. And now we're ready to add. Now we are ready to add. So one plus a bunch of zeros is one, a bunch of zeros, that's gonna be one. One plus a zero, a bunch of zeros is one, zeros and one. And we're done. And obviously if we had more than one, one in any of these places right over here, then we might have had to carry a one. But we saw that when we added numbers in binary. Well, let's actually verify that this is the number that we would expect it to be. Remember, this right over here is the ones, so let's see, this is ones, fours, let me write it down. This is ones, sorry, ones, twos, fours, eights, sixteens, and thirty-twos. So we have, so we have one thirty-two, so it's gonna be thirty-two, plus one eight. And we only have to do this for ourselves because we're so used to thinking in base ten. If you were thinking in base two, you'd say, oh, I know what this number is, and you would have some name for it, other, probably different than forty-five, because forty-five, the name essentially is kind of a base ten name, and we'd probably have better names in terms of base two. Someone actually should do that. That would be a fun, that would be a fun, you would call, well, we would call this, well, that would be a fun project. So let's see, we have thirty-two, plus eight, plus four, plus four, plus one, plus one, which is indeed equal to forty-five.
