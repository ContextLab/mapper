What we're going to do in this video is review the notion of composite functions, and then build some skills recognizing how functions can actually be composed. If you've never heard of the term composite functions or if the first few minutes of this video look unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to watch the algebra videos on composite functions on Khan Academy. The goal of this one is to really be a little bit of a practice before we get into some skills that are necessary in calculus, in particular, the chain rule. So let's just review what a composite function is. So let's say that I have F of X, F of X being equal to one plus X, and let's say that we have G of X is equal to, let's say G of X is equal to cosine of X. So what would F of G of X be? F of G of X. And I encourage you to pause this video and try to work it out on your own. Well, one way to think about it is the input into F of X is no longer X, it is G of X. So everywhere where we see an X in the definition of F of X, we would replace with a G of X. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to one plus, instead of the input being X, the input is G of X, so the output is one plus G of X. And G of X, of course, is cosine of X. So instead of writing G of X there, I could write cosine of X. And one way to visualize this is I'm putting my X into G of X first. So X goes into the function G, and it outputs G of X. And then we're gonna take that output G of X and then input it into F of X, or input it into the function F, I should say. We input into the function F, and that is going to output F of whatever the input was, and the input is G of X, G of X. So now with that review out of the way, let's see if we can go the other way around. Let's see if we can look at some type of a function definition and say, can we express that as a composition of other functions? So let's start with, let's say that I have a G of X is equal to cosine of sin of X plus one. And I also wanna state there's oftentimes more than one way to compose, or to construct a function based on the composition of other ones. But with that said, pause this video and say, hey, can I express G of X as a composition of two other functions, let's say an F and an H of X? So there's a couple of ways that you could think about it. You could say, all right, let's see, I have this sin of X right over here. So what if I called that an F of X? So let's say I called that, well, actually let me use a different variable so we don't get confused here. Let me call this U of X, the sin of X right over there. So this would be cosine of U of X plus one. And so if we then divided, if we then defined another function as V of X being equal to cosine of whatever its input is plus one, well then this looks like the composition of V and U of X. Instead of V of X, if we did V of U of X, then this would be cosine of U of X plus one. Let me write that down. So if we wrote V of U of X, which is sin of X, if we did V of U of X, that is going to be equal to cosine of, instead of an X plus one, it's going to be a U of X plus one. And U of X, let me write this here, U of X is equal to sin of X. That's how we've set this up. So we can either write cosine of U of X plus one or cosine of sin of X plus one, which was exactly what we had before. And so this function G of X, if we say U of X is equal to sin of X, if we say U of X is equal to sin of X, and V of X is equal to cosine of X plus one, then we could write G of X as the composition of these two functions. Now you could even make it a composition of three functions. We could keep U of X to be equal to sin of X. We could define, let's say, W of X to be equal to X plus one. And so then, let's think about it, W of X, W of U of X, I should say, W of U, let me do the same color, W of U of X is going to be equal to, now my input is no longer X, it's a U of X, so it's going to be a U of X plus one, or just sin of X plus one. So that's sin of X plus one. And then if we define a third function, let's say, let's see, I'll call it, let's call it H, I'm running out of variables. Oh, there are a lot of letters left. So if I say H of X is just equal to the cosine of whatever I input, so it's equal to the cosine of X, well then H of W of U of X is gonna be G of X, let me write that down, H of W of U of X, U of X is going to be equal to, remember, H of X takes the cosine of whatever its input is, so it's gonna take the cosine. Now, its input is W of U of X, we already figured out W of U of X is going to be this business. So it's going to be sin of X plus one, where the U of X is sin of X, but then we input that into W, so we got sin of X plus one, and then we input that into H to get cosine of that, which is our original expression, which is equal to G of X. So the whole point here is to appreciate how to recognize compositions of functions. Now, I wanna stress, it's not always going to be a composition of a function. For example, if I have some function, let me just clear this out, if I had some function F of X is equal to cosine of X times sin of X, it would be hard to express this as a composition of functions, but I can represent it as a product of functions. For example, I could say cosine of X, I could say U of X is equal to cosine of X, and I could say V of X, let me just a different color, I could say V of X is equal to sin of X, and so here F of X wouldn't be the composition of U and V, it would be the product. F of X is equal to U of X times V of X, V of X. If we were to take the composition, if we were to say U of V of X, pause the video, think about what that is, and that's a little bit of review. Well, this is going to be, I take U of X, takes the cosine of whatever is input, and now the input is V of X, which would be sin of X. Sin of X, and then if you did V of U of X, well, that'd be the other way around, it would be sin of cosine of X. But anyway, this is once again, just to help us recognize, hey, when I look at an expression or a function definition, am I looking at products of functions, am I looking at compositions of functions? Sometimes you're looking at products of compositions or quotients of compositions, all sorts of different combinations of how you can put functions together to create new functions.
