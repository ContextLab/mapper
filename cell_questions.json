          "options": {
            "A": "Because larger objects require more precise control to avoid collisions that would cause the katamari to shrink.",
            "B": "Because the game's difficulty scales exponentially with the number of objects collected, making later levels impossible to complete.",
            "C": "Because players must reverse their strategy when the katamari becomes too large to collect smaller objects.",
            "D": "Because the katamari's adhesive surface weakens as it grows, making it harder to collect objects."
