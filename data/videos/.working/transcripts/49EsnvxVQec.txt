Hello grammarians. Hello Rosie. Hello David. So, okay, so you know the schoolhouse rock song Conjunction Junction right classic classic. So in that song, you know, the the the chorus asks like conjunction junction What's your function and then this engineer played by Jack Sheldon goes hooking up words and phrases and clauses? So that's what we're gonna talk about today is the difference between a phrase and a clause because both of them are groups of words Right phrases and clauses are both groups of words, but they each do different things. So let's let's break that down So Rosie if you please what is a phrase? So phrases a group of words and it acts like a single part of speech Okay, but it's not it will never be a full sentence Because phrases don't have both a subject and a verb All right. So a phrase can never be a sentence. Right? What are some examples of phrases my best friend So this is a group of words that ultimately behaves like a noun, right? Okay Then there's an adjective phrase with the blue shirt So this is a prepositional phrase that as you said is behaving like an adjective, right? Okay, and then for 20 days Which behaves like an adverb. So this is a noun phrase an adjective phrase and an adverbial phrase So none of these things can be sentences, but they all like you said act like parts of speech Okay. Meanwhile a clause is a group of words that can be a sentence it's not always a sentence, but the the big difference between phrases and clauses is That clauses do have both a subject and a verb So it's not it can't be a phrase because a phrase is just one part of speech But a clause always has a noun or pronoun component and a verb component. That's right. Okay so a clause could be a Dependent clause which can't stand on its own for example the wizard who cast a spell Right that can't be its own sentence But it's got a lot going on So that's not a sentence but it can also be independent right so if we said the wizard cast a spell That would that's also a clause and it's also its own sentence So let's let's test a couple of things and see if they are phrases or clauses Okay, the falcon sword majestically. So this is a group of words And we've got this the falcon here That that's a noun phrase that that's behaving like a part of speech So I know that this definitely has a phrase in it, right? But is it just a phrase on its own? I guess I would have to say no because it's got this verb sword and this adverb Majestically so the falcon sword majestically. I would have to say this is a clause. Would I be right? You would be right That's not only a clause, but it's an independent clause So it could be its own sentence with a period right So let's get a little bit of George Harrison in here while my guitar gently weeps So we've got a subject in here my guitar and a verb weeps So we know it's a clause, but it begins with this word while which is I think it's a coordinating conjunction So this would be actually a dependent clause, but it is a clause so this thing could not be a sentence on its own That's right Yeah, one for you Rosie. What about the best ham sandwich in Oklahoma? Is that a phrase or a clause? That is a phrase. Okay. Why is that? We don't have a verb. This is a this is all a subject Okay, and I mean we've got the best so we've kind of got this superlative thrown in there. Mm-hmm But it's all modifying ham sandwich, right? It's actually all modifying sandwich because it's the best ham sandwich And then we've got this other prepositional phrase that also modifies sandwich, right? So that's a phrase How about under the ocean blue that is a phrase, okay So what makes you say that? well again, we don't have a verb So we've got a subject The ocean and we have under that's a preposition So we have kind of a direction and a subject we have a direction and a place, but we don't have an action And that would make it a phrase and not a clause So phrases are groups of words that act like parts of speech. So this one for example Is an adjectival or adverbial phrase? We don't know because we don't know what it's modifying and This one is a noun phrase the best ham sandwich in Oklahoma. It's behaving like a noun and clauses are groups of phrases That have a subject and a verb. So while my guitar gently weeps that there's a guitar. What is it doing? It's weeping so we know it's a clause We'll go into what the difference between a dependent and an independent clause is next time But just know for now This is a clause over here and this this clause over here the Falcon sword majestically is also a clause by Dint of the fact that it has both a subject the Falcon and a verb sword majestically, right Cool that is phrases and clauses.
