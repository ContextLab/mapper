We're told Ms. Marshall bought a hockey ticket with the money shown below. The digit five in the amount of money Ms. Marshall spent represents, what amount of money, and this is just a screenshot from Khan Academy, there's a dropdown there, but we'll just figure out what you hopefully will see in the dropdown, and then what place value is that? So pause this video, have a go at that. So you might say, is it five holes? Is it five tenths? Is it five hundredths? Something like that. All right, so the way I would do this is first just count up the money. So I have, this is one, two plus 10, so this is $12 right over here, and I have four quarters here, so that's another dollar, all right over there, that's another dollar, and now I have 25 cents, I have three dimes, 10, 10, 10, and then two pennies. So 25 plus 10 is 35, plus another 10 is 45, plus another 10 is 55, plus these two pennies is 55 cents. So this is 55, 55 cents, and so if I were to add this all up, the total number of dollars I have is 12 plus one, that's $13, and 50, oh sorry, not 55 cents, it's 57 cents. That would have gotten confusing, because then they would have two fives there, and 57 cents, so I have $13, and 57 cents. All right, so it's good, there's only one five in our answer. So what does that represent? So this right over here is in the tenths place, so this right over here is five tenths of a dollar, or another way to think about it, this is also 50 cents. This is also, I could write it like this, 50 cents, I could also write it like this, 50 cents, either way it's 50 cents and it's five tenths of a dollar. So when I go into this dropdown here, hopefully I can find 50 cents here, and in place value, hopefully I can find five tenths over there.
