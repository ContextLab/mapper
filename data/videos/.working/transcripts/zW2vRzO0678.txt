Just to clarify the discussion and review a little bit of really the last six videos, the Geithner Plan consists of two plans. There's a legacy loans plan, and then there's a legacy securities. And I talked about this in the last video, legacy securities. And what immediately is, I would say, at best suspicious is that what everyone can participate in is the legacy loans program. But this isn't really the crux of the issue that everyone's been talking about in the financial crisis. The whole issue of the non-liquid markets and the collateralized debt obligations and the difference between the bid and the ask price, that's occurring here in the legacy securities program. And they've limited this to essentially only five players. And they've made the bar so high, namely, that you have to have greater than $10 billion in legacy secure, in these types of what they call eligible securities, which means these toxic assets, eligible securities. So first of all, there aren't that many fund complexes that even manage $10 billion total, much less that already own $10 billion in eligible securities. And I don't know if that's $10 billion of face value or market value. I'm assuming face value, because arguably we don't know what the market value is. But this is a very small group of people. And it's arguably not much more than five players. So even though the Treasury is making it look like they don't know who these five people are going to be, and they're going to have some type of competitive process, we can rest assured that they've already talked to these five players, they know exactly who these five people are. They know that not that many people can even compete to be one of the five players. And they wouldn't even announce the number five, or that there would be five players if they already didn't have the buy-in from these five guys. And what makes the legacy securities, besides the fact that it's being limited to a small pool of people who could easily collude with each other, and the Treasury, and the banks in some way, what makes this especially disturbing is that the legacy security program actually allows even more leverage, or even a better option, a put option, than what's offered in the legacy loans program. And just to kind of review, instead of, let's say someone thought that the fair value of a security was $30. And this is a pure review of the last video, but I think it's worth mentioning, because I think I might have done it a little bit too fast at the end of the video. The payoff for your security would look like this. So let's say that the x-axis is the value of security, and then this is the value of your investment. Well, in this reality, your entire investment is the security, so the payoff is just going to be a line that looks like this. It's just going to look like that. So let's say you paid, this is the amount that you paid, you paid $30 from the get-go. So if the security ends up being worth $40 right here, then the value of your investment is $40, and you would have made this difference. You would have made the $10. Likewise, if the security ends up being worth $20, that's right here. This is the value of security, then your investment is worth $20, and you'll take this $10 hit. This is kind of the plain vanilla scenario before the Geithner situation. What we explained in the last video is instead of doing this, if you are one of the lucky five players to participate in the legacy securities program, instead of putting $30 in, you could put $225 in to one of these funds. $225 from you. The treasury puts in another $225. This is from the treasury. This is from Pimrock, one of the five players. And then the extra leverage here is that the treasury will then give up to another 100% loan on top of this. So this is $450, so the treasury will then give, I'll do loans in yellow, will give another $450 loan here. They say 50% to 100%, but it's at the treasury's discretion, and we're really just trying to figure out how much the taxpayer can get hosed. 100%. And then this capital right here can then participate in the legacy TALF program, which allows them to buy these legacy toxic assets. And so then they go to the Fed and they say, OK, Fed, give us a loan. The Fed can then give them a loan for $51, right, get that six to one leverage. And my suspicion is that they're going to allow more than six to one leverage. They're just using six to one as the example, because it is at the discretion of the Fed. The Fed just talks about haircuts. Haircut is essentially just how much leverage. If they take a 10% haircut on the collateral, that means that they're allowing 10 to one leverage. But anyway, this is the loan from the Fed, $51. This is the example I did last time. And then you have $60 of buying power. Which you could then, instead of buying one security, you could then buy two securities. And I explained in the last video the whole reason why I even did this is because we're splitting the equity with the treasury. So if we want the same upside, we have to buy twice as many securities. But in this reality now, if the value of the security ends up being worth $40, then each of these are worth $40. The total value of all of this is worth $80. You pay off these loans, so you have $80 minus 55.50. That's 24.50. And then let me see, did I do that math right? 4 minus 4.50. So that's 55.50. Right, that's 24.50. And then that 24.50 is essentially what represents the equity capital. That's what the assets minus all of your liabilities. And then this is split between you and the treasury, so you get half of that. So it's 12.50. The value of your investment is 12.50. So you just made $10, right? Because your initial investment was only $225. And to make it look right on this diagram, let's say you start with $30. Instead of putting it all in the security, what you do is you put $225 here, and then you put $27.75 aside in some super safe situation. And if you do that, in this reality, if the security is worth $40, the value of your investment is worth $40. Because this $225 is now worth $12.25, and then you have the $27.75, so then that gets you to $40. If it's worth $30, you're still kind of on this line. But then if this value here drops below $27.75, you're OK. You get wiped out here, but you still have all this cash sitting on the side. So the payoff in the legacy securities program looks like this, and this is a complete review, and maybe I didn't have to review it this much in this video. The payoff looks like this. And so this investment that we've structured through the legacy securities program is the exact same thing as if I had bought the security and then also had a put option. A put option gives you the right to sell at a certain price, so a put option at a $27.75 strike price. And so what the government is essentially giving is this for free, and maybe I'll pay a little bit more for it because I'm getting this option for free. And in the last video, we used an option price calculator to try to put a value on this. We said, wow, this could be as much as $24, $25 of value depending on your assumptions. And so now a rational investor who is willing to pay $30 might be willing to pay as much as $24, $25. And that by itself could close this bid-ask gap that everyone's talked about, where the banks won't sell for less than $60, that's the offer price, while the market's not willing to pay for $30. But there's something else going on here, and this goes back to the notion that there's only five players. There's only five players, and they all have $10 billion already invested in these markets. And frankly, they have $10 billion already in these legacy securities, and the rest of their assets are bonds, many of them which are going to be loans to financial intermediaries, to banks, to other people that essentially are intertwined with this whole mess. So if you view it that way, just going back to the Geithner 2 video, the Geithner 2 video was a very almost naive analysis of how a bank could self-deal or bank's incentive to overpay for these things. But what you realize is if you're one of these five players right here, you have just as strong of an incentive to use the government's money to overpay for these assets. If my balance sheet, if I'm Pimrock, these are my assets, and I don't know how they capitalize their situation. I assume most of their capital comes from just direct investments from people, but maybe they leverage as a solution. Let me give the benefit of that. Let's say it's all equity. If you look at Pimrock's holdings, some fictional large bond company, sure, maybe $10 billion are these toxic assets, right? But guess what? They have a ton of other loans. Let's say that they have a $5 billion loan. Let me say, for the sake of argument, let's say they have a $10 billion loan to, I don't know, Citibank. Let me draw Citibank's balance sheet now. So let's say Citibank, and you can play with the numbers, but I just want to really illustrate the point of why Pimrock would want to overpay for Citibank's assets. Let me draw their liability side of their balance sheet. So Citibank has some toxic assets right here. Who cares? Maybe I'll describe some value to you. This is their equity. This is Citibank's equity. And they have a loan from Pimrock. Pimrock owns $10 billion of Citibank bonds. And they're probably not the only person, and we could talk about that situation. Although the five people participating in this program probably do represent a large chunk of the bonds that the banks trying to offload the assets have out there. And frankly, the other bonds that they've borrowed from are from banks that therefore then issued more bonds to these guys. So these guys really are the linchpin of the system. But just to make the diagram clear, so Citibank has a $10 billion loan from Pimrock. This is toxic right here. Now if we just force the market to happen, Citibank's not going to get this amount for it. They're only going to get this amount. So this is what Citibank's balance sheet would look like. This is before the Geithner plan. Those toxic assets would get disposed. The balance sheet would shrink to that. But their liabilities are larger. Citibank's liabilities would look like that. And obviously, the equity is whatever occurs after you subtract out the liabilities from the assets. But you have negative equity here, so the stockholders get wiped out in that scenario. But even these bond holder right here, this bond holder, in this case Pimrock, gets impaired. The value of the security would get a haircut of some. It would be, well, depending on how you want to talk about it, but if in a bankruptcy situation, this would be called the fulcrum security. This is a security where the real enterprise value of the company sits. So if your Pimrock right here, if you overpay, if you use some of your extra capital, and actually it's not even extra capital, you're going to start a new fund partnering with the treasury. But if that new fund right here uses their app money to overpay for these toxic assets, instead of paying only this amount for them, they overpay this amount. And they're doing it, remember, primarily with government money, and they're allowing you to lever up 25, 30 to 1, where the government is taking really 90, 95% of the hit. So you use the government money to overpay these things. But you aren't the bank, but that makes these bonds good. Now all of a sudden, these other assets that you own that were loans to other banks, now they become good. Now Citibank might have had other loans to other banks, but those other banks might have borrowed from Pimrock. So when you make their loans good, then you make this bank less likely default. And so the entire bond portfolio, especially the part that's exposed to the financial sector, then becomes worth a lot more. So on a lot of levels, one, you're giving them this huge put option, which gives this huge incentive to overpay for the securities. You're making it very closed, and you essentially are pre-picking who gets to participate, and that makes it very easy to collude. And by making the people who already participated in the mess, these people are already kind of knee deep in it, because they already have $10 billion of exposure, you're giving them a huge incentive to use taxpayer money to essentially overpay for the legacy securities. And the net effect of all of this is that these guys are going to make out pretty well, the banks are going to make out super well, because the taxpayer is essentially issuing free put options and providing a huge incentive to overpay for these assets. And obviously, Bill Grosz said that it's kind of a win-win-win for the investors, for the banks, and the taxpayers. But it's very clear from this situation that it's a big zero for the taxpayers, and they really are just further subsidizing the same people on a massive scale. I mean, we're talking about close to a trillion dollars, and I wouldn't be surprised if we exceed a trillion dollars before all of this is said and done, to the very same people who essentially caused this disaster. So it's like if we started selling arms to Al Qaeda. Anyway, see you in the next video.
