Hi, I'm Lauren from Khan Academy, and today I'm going to give you an overview of how to set up accounts for yourself and your children on Khan Academy. We'll also go over how you can find relevant content for your kids and view their progress. This video is meant for parents with kids who are 12 or under. If your child is 13 or older, please see our other video called Parent Quick Start Tips for Kids Ages 13+. We will start by having your child create an account on Khan Academy. Creating an account lets you and your child track progress and time spent learning. Go to www.khanacademy.org and click Sign Up in the upper right-hand corner. On the Sign Up page, enter your child's date of birth and click Sign Up by choosing a username. On the next page, enter your email address and choose a username for your child. Then click Sign Up. Next, choose a starting point for your child's learning journey. When the Personalize Khan Academy pop up, select your child's grade and click Continue. On the next page, you'll see courses that we recommend for your child. Choose one or more and click Continue. You can also click the See All link to view the full menu. Your child is ready to go. Have them click the blue Start button for any course to start with the very first lesson or click See All to browse the entire course. If you're not sure what level your child is at, here's a tip. Most Khan Academy math courses include a course challenge that can help you quickly find where your child needs practice and where they're already good to go. To get there, scroll to the bottom of the course page and click Start Course Challenge. These usually take 30 to 45 minutes and will give you some good clues about where to direct their learning. You can have your child start one grade level below their current grade or even start at kindergarten and work their way up. Next, let's create a parent account. You must create a parent account within seven days or all child accounts will be deleted. To create an account, check your email. For each child, you'll have an Approve Your Child Khan Academy account email waiting. Click the green Allow My Child to Use Khan Academy button. Check your updates or other mail folders if you don't see this email right away. Follow the prompts to sign up for a new account or sign into an existing account using the email address where you received the email. Once you sign up, you'll be taken to your parent dashboard. If you want to view your child's progress, you can click on your child's username. This takes you to the Progress Report where you can keep track of what they're learning and how much time they're spending. Your child can also see this report through their account by clicking Progress in their left navigation. Thanks for watching and we hope you and your child enjoy learning on Khan Academy.
