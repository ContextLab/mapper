So we've got the differential equation, the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to three times y. And we want to find the particular solution that gives us y being equal to two when x is equal to one. So I encourage you to pause this video and see if you can figure this out on your own. All right, now let's work through it together. So some of you might have immediately said, hey, this is the form of a differential equation where the solution is going to be exponential and you just got right to it. But I'm not gonna go straight to that. I'm just gonna recognize that this is a separable differential equation and then I'm gonna solve it that way. So when I say it's separable, that means we can separate all the y's, d y's on one side and all the x's, d x's on the other side. And so what I could do is if I divide both sides of this equation by y and multiply both sides by d x, I get one over y, d y, is equal to three, d x. Now on the left and right hand sides, I have these clean things that I can now integrate. That's what people talk about when they say separable differential equations. Now here on the left, if I wanted to write it in a fairly general form, I could write, well the antiderivative of one over y is gonna be the natural log of the absolute value of y. I'm taking the antiderivative with respect to y here. Now I could add a constant, but I'm gonna add a constant on the right hand side so there's no reason to add two arbitrary constants on both sides. I could just add one on one side. So that is going to be equal to, the antiderivative here is going to be three x and I'll add the promised constant plus c right over there. And now let's think about it a little bit. Well we can rewrite this in exponential form. We could say, we could write that e to the three x plus c is equal to the natural log of y. I could write the natural log of y is equal to e to the three x plus c. Now I could rewrite this as equal to e to the three x times e to the c. Now e to the c is just going to be some other arbitrary constant, which I could still denote by c. They're gonna be different values, but we're just trying to just get a sense of what the structure of this thing looks like. So we could say this is going to be some constant times e to the three x. So another way of thinking about it, seeing the absolute value of y is equal to this, this isn't a function yet. We're trying to find a function solution to this differential equation. So this would tell us that either y is equal to c e to the three x or y is equal to negative c e to the three x. Well we've kept it in general terms. I haven't put any, we don't know what c is so what we could do instead is just pick this one and then we can solve for c assuming this one right over here. And so we will see if we can meet these constraints using this and it'll essentially take the other one into consideration, whether we're going positive or negative. So let's do that. So when y is equal to two, when y is equal to two, I'm not going to solve for c to find the particular solution, x is equal to one. Or when x is equal to one, y is equal to two. So I could write it like that. And we get two is equal to c times e to the third power, three times one. And so to solve for c I can just divide both sides by e to the third or I can multiply both sides times e to the negative third and I could get two e to the negative third power is equal to c. And so let's now substitute it back in. And our particular solution is going to be y is equal to c. C is two e to the negative third power times e to the three x. Now I'm taking the product of two things with the same base. I can add the exponent so I could say y is equal to two times e to the three x and then I'll add the exponents to three x minus three. And there you go. This is one way that you could write the particular solution that meets these constraints for this separable differential equation.
