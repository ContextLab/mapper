        "D": "Patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage cannot perform any cognitive tasks whatsoever — including basic arithmetic, language comprehension, visual perception, and working memory tasks — because the vmPFC is the central hub of all higher cognitive processing, and its damage produces global cognitive collapse affecting every domain of intellectual function measured by standardized neuropsychological assessments"

IIT proposes consciousness IS integrated information (Φ), a mathematical quantity, focusing on intrinsic structure. They diverge: GNW predicts posterior-to-anterior ignition; IIT predicts posterior 'hot zones' suffice and Φ can exist without global broadcast",

        "D": "Both theories agree that consciousness resides exclusively in the brainstem reticular activating system and that cortical neural activity is entirely irrelevant to conscious experience — neither prefrontal-parietal networks nor posterior cortical hot zones contribute anything meaningful to the generation of phenomenal consciousness, and all cortical correlates of consciousness identified in neuroimaging studies reflect post-conscious processing of information that has already been rendered conscious by brainstem mechanisms alone"

        "B": "Embodied cognition predicts that all cognitive operations without exception require concurrent physical movement of the body or motor system activation, a prediction that has been universally confirmed across every experiment ever conducted in cognitive psychology and neuroscience — including studies of abstract mathematical reasoning, logical deduction, moral judgment, and aesthetic appreciation, all of which show robust and obligatory motor cortex activation that is abolished by temporary motor cortex disruption via transcranial magnetic stimulation",

However, landmark findings like the warm cup effect (Williams & Bargh 2008) failed to replicate in large pre-registered studies.

Perception minimizes free energy by updating models to predict input (equivalent to predictive coding). Action minimizes it by changing sensory input to match predictions (active inference). Learning optimizes model parameters over longer timescales. This unifies these processes under one imperative: minimize divergence between the organism's model and the world's statistical structure",

        "C": "Phase-amplitude coupling applies exclusively to visual processing in the occipital lobe and has never been observed in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or any other brain region; the theta-gamma coupling reported in hippocampal recordings is a technical artifact of the high signal-to-noise ratio in hippocampal local field potentials combined with the broad spectral power distribution inherent to theta oscillations, which creates spurious apparent coupling with higher frequency bands",

        "B": "Hemispatial neglect is caused exclusively by damage to the retina and optic nerves of the eyes rather than by any damage to cortical or subcortical brain structures — the parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, and subcortical attention networks play absolutely no role in spatial awareness, and all neglect phenomena can be fully explained by peripheral sensory loss without invoking any central attentional mechanism",

      "options": {
        "A": "Neurons in the medial temporal lobe respond to specific concepts (e.g., 'Jennifer Aniston neuron') with remarkable selectivity and invariance across modalities (photo, name, drawing), but this likely reflects sparse distributed coding rather than single-cell representation — individual neurons participate in multiple representations, and each concept is encoded by a small population of selectively tuned cells",
        "B": "Every individual person, specific object, abstract concept, and unique memory is represented by exactly one single dedicated neuron that fires exclusively and only for that particular entity and never for anything else under any circumstance — this strict grandmother cell doctrine means the brain allocates one neuron per concept with no overlap, no distributed coding, no population-level representation, and no sharing of neural resources between different conceptual representations whatsoever",
        "C": "No neuron anywhere in the human brain shows any degree of selectivity or preferential response for specific stimuli, categories, or concepts — all neurons throughout the cortex, hippocampus, and subcortical structures respond identically and uniformly to all possible visual, auditory, and conceptual inputs, with no tuning curves, no receptive fields, no category selectivity, and no invariant representations observed in any single-unit recording study",
        "D": "Population coding as a neural representational scheme has been conclusively and definitively disproven by decades of single-unit recording research, and the grandmother cell hypothesis is now universally accepted as the only coding mechanism operating anywhere in the human brain — every neuroscience textbook, peer-reviewed study, and computational model confirms that individual dedicated neurons, not distributed populations, are the sole representational format used by the nervous system"
