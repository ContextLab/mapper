I'm here with Jessica. What do you do here Jessica? Great question, Zell. I am, my title here is the Chief of Staff, but I like to think of it as a catch-all for any position that we haven't hired full-time for I pick up. So it's a lot on the business strategy and operations side of the house and covers everything from you know recruiting and prepping our documentation for our board meetings to going to Costco and picking up the toilet paper if we need it. When necessary. It's a very high level tasks to somewhat low level but sometimes has to get done. And how did you end up here? Where did you start your career? What did you think you were going to end up being? Yeah so I am a native of California so I went through the UC system, went to UC San Diego and started studying electrical engineering. And you went on some type of like super scholarship. I was a Jacobs Scholar while I was there. It is a full full merit scholarship. For Erwin Jacobs? Yes, Dr. Erwin Jacobs and his wife Joan, very generous supporters of UC San Diego and started the scholarship program in hopes of attracting talent on the caliber of the Ivy Leagues. He had been at MIT before that and had wanted to kind of create that culture. And this was like a full ride? It was a full ride. And how many students got or got this at UCSD every year? So the inaugural class and we were a class of ten. A class of ten. Probably not too easy to get. I was I figure I was just really really lucky that my parents were very happy to. And they could go by a car or something. They were able to retire a little bit earlier. And so you you major in electrical engineering and so you thought you were going to be electrical engineer? I did so I did all of my internships in electrical engineering. I had worked at a number of defense companies, worked at Qualcomm. And then I ended up going to Stanford for a PhD in electrical engineering. And then my first quarter actually got sidetracked when a friend took me to a management consulting info session. That was actually geared towards engineers. And I had no idea what this field was and never heard of it. Few people do. But they talked about you know you can have all this impact. You get to work with you know amazing companies and learn a lot and travel the world while you're at it. And I just thought what could be a better education while getting you know paid a little bit at the same time. Staying in nice hotels and... Exactly. It's amazing how quickly you become obsessed with like travel points. And how long did you do that for? I did that for three and a half years following my master's. So I went directly from Stanford into McKinsey. So you were now in your like early 20s? Mid 20s. And what kind of work... how was McKinsey what you expected or how is it different than you expected? And what kind of stuff did you end up doing? So I ended up focusing on kind of I guess consultancy jargon of operational and organizational transformation. Which looks at the operational piece goes into organizations oftentimes. It's technology organizations in my case. And looking at how people did things and thinking of ways they could do it more effectively or more efficiently. So I worked with engineers, data centers, executives and the like. On the organizational side it was actually looking more at how company culture was and how you could make that thrive in an organization. And think about development for people. Which sounds eerily similar to some of what you do here. Yes very eerily similar. And then a third piece of what I did at McKinsey I had this awesome stint in their internal learning group. So developing the training of how to make a consultant a consultant and looking at how to allow people to learn how to problem solve and become better with client relationships and interpersonal skills. So I really love the learning piece of it. And while you're at McKinsey that's where you first met Shonta who's our president. Yes we worked on several projects together. And despite that you still wanted to work with them. Despite that for some reason Rose colored glasses and I still remember really good memories out of it. Yeah consulting was interesting. It was a lot of long hours a lot of travel. People think it's glamorous when you're traveling to other places. Oftentimes it was like typing up my PowerPoint slides as I was on the go. It's probably a little bit of both. It was a little bit glamorous. The traveling was amazing. I don't think I ever would have had an opportunity. And you're normally and you were interfacing at a very high level with a lot of these organizations. Kind of the senior executives. Best learning experience I could have ever hoped for. Especially at that age to be able to interface with senior people at some major organizations I could imagine would be very. Absolutely. It was an incredible training ground. And then after that you was three and a half years and then you decide to leave for. Yeah. So after three and a half years the lifestyle was tough. I found whenever I was at home I was just kind of sleeping to make up for the work week. And so I decided to leave and I went to Yahoo. Given my kind of background in transformations this was a company that was in the midst of a huge one and I thought I could help. So I went there. Also was a great actual learning ground for me. I was able to interface with everybody from the engineers to marketing finance legal and just learned about the entire organization and how things worked both on the search side of the house as well as on the advertising side of the house. And you worked with a whole I guess what type of you ended up at search. You were a product manager there. Yes. So I ended up in search as a senior project manager by the time I left. And so that sounded pretty good. So how did you end up here. Yeah. So I was now in hindsight is the worst decision you've ever made. Best decision ever. You can pay me five dollars after. Yes. Yes. I would have edited out any negative remarks. I had I had kept in touch with Sean to know. And so he had told me over over time about how he was interfacing with this guy named Sal who was making these YouTube videos. And you know I just thought it was really cool. I checked out the site and that we had all these practice modules and some analytics behind it and just thought what was happening here was awesome. So I offered up my free time and said hey I'd love to volunteer. Started doing that. And then right around the time of the TED talk things kind of got really crazy for you guys. And I had been helping to try to find actually a different role that you were thinking of hiring at the time. And then when kind of things got crazy. Sean said hey actually you might actually be a great. I think we realized you were doing more in your free time than we would have expected from a whole. It's like maybe yes. That's right. For this. And then you've come. And I mean that was a was 18 months ago but it was like an early stay. I mean this was how many people were we then. Yeah when I joined I think I was employee number six right after Marcia. She was. Yeah. Really early. And now we're at what we're at. We're now I believe we're in our early 30s early 30s early 30s. There are 30 to 30 31 32 people and we have a bunch of interns right. Yeah. We're like we're like five times bigger than we were. It's incredible how much we've grown. Yeah it is incredible. Wow. And what's your takeaway. I mean how what's the experience been like and where do you think this is going to go. Yeah. So my experience has been phenomenal. I think beyond what I could have I don't believe you. I'm sure. But anyway. But it's just been amazing. I think the people here are all just so. So thoughtful and so nice and just awesome like everyone's brilliant but just humble about it. And so I just feel incredibly lucky to be amongst this group of folks. I think as we've grown we've been able to name the quirky fun culture of being proactive and thinking epic and shipping beats for perfection some of our values. We've been really great at keeping that going. You know as we grow it's interesting. I think you know you want to pose a question around where would we be like 500 years from now. What would that ideal picture be like. And I think it'd be awesome if Khan Academy still exists in 500 years and that we're still completely free and that we have all the content that anybody could want to learn. Plug directly into their brain. Yes. But at that point hopefully it's just you know you know plug in and you're done. But I think that would be amazing if we could leave something for future generations to be able to use and have a resource that you know at this point in time seemed unthinkable that it would be free and that anybody could access that quality of education. You're inspiring me Jessica. Oh the feelings mutual.
