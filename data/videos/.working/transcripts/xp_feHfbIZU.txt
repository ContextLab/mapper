There's still a lot of confusion over Geithner's new plan and the legacy loans and the legacy securities program and how much leverage does it allow and what are all the different ways to game the system. And to be frank, the more I read about it, the worse it begins to look. And everything that I've talked about in the previous videos about how you could game it and the amount of leverage and the insurance that the government is giving away for free is actually worse than I originally thought. So just to clarify things, so if we could call it the public private investment, what is it, fund or program or whatever it's called, I call it the Geithner plan. There's actually two different plans here. There's the legacy loans plan, legacy loans, and then there's the legacy securities plan. Legacy securities. Everything I've talked about so far has been the legacy loan plan. And actually, that's my bad because it's really the legacy securities plan that's a lot shadier. And just to be clear, legacy loan plan is if there's some bank over here on its books, let's say it has some actual loans, these could be construction loans or loans for commercial housing, whatever. It's just a group of loans out there that it needs to get off of its balance sheet. That's what the legacy loans program allows to do. Some private investor can contribute $7. The treasury will contribute another $7. The Fed will give a $86 loan. And then they can use all of that money. And actually, I should have done it on the other side of the balance sheet. But this will be, let's say, $100 of buying power that they can go use to buy these loans off these banks. And that's fine. And everything I talked about before, the put option and all of that, that still applies here. You're still getting, depending on how you view it, either 6 to 1 leverage or 12 to 1 leverage, depending on how you want to think about it. But everything in the last videos apply. But what's kind of shady here is this is the program that they're opening up to everyone. Or anyone who can kind of navigate all the paperwork and how you can get included, et cetera, et cetera. But essentially, a bunch of hedge funds and investment funds can participate in this. And because there will be so many participants, it'll be probably pretty transparent. But what's weird about that is that legacy loans, although that is part of the problem with all of the illiquidity that's happening, that isn't kind of the crux of the problem. The crux of the problem were all of these mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations and all of that. And those don't apply in the legacy loan program. So the thing that you're applying to everyone isn't the thing that's really the big problem sitting on banks' balance sheets. Most of the toxic assets that everyone talks about, so most of the things that when, let's see, this is another bank's balance sheet. This is its liability. This is its equity. Most of the toxic stuff that people are talking about, let's say this is a toxic asset, these aren't legacy loans. These are CDOs or derivative CDOs or mortgage-backed securities, whatever you want to view it. And these fall into the legacy security program. And these are the things when everyone talks about the market's only willing to pay $0.30 on the dollar, while the bank's only willing to sell it for $0.60 on the dollar, that applies to this reality here. And when you look at the legacy security program, it is a lot shadier than the legacy loan program. This one is open to anyone, or for the most part, anyone. This program right here, it's only going to be open to five investment managers, five managers. And it's not like there's 500 people could compete to be those five managers. They've actually set the bar pretty fine on who can be a manager. You have to have $10 billion under management, and not total assets under management. $10 billion of this kind of stuff already under management. So you have to have $10 billion already under management of collateralized debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities. And then maybe out of all of these, the less strict thing is that you have to show the ability to raise $500 more million to participate in this plan. So even though they say that you have to apply to be one of these five managers, there probably aren't more than five managers already out there who have $10 billion under management of these types of securities. I mean, if you have $10 billion of these types of securities, you probably have hundreds of billions under management. And frankly, two names come to my mind immediately. I haven't done enough research on this to figure out who the other three are. But PIMCO and BlackRock are definitely going to be included in that group. And then there's going to be three other people. So even though the geitner is making it look like it's some type of competitive process, he's essentially already picked to the people. And I'm sure he's already had conversations with the five guys who are going to participate in this, because he wouldn't have projected out this number five unless he already had the agreement of these two guys and then three more. And then what makes this even shadier, obviously this is going to be more closed and more opaque to the outside world and what's going on. You could usually get five guys in a room and kind of make a deal. What makes it even shadier is that the leverage allowed in this program is even more extreme than the leverage allowed in this program. So here, just to give you an example, let's say I had PIMRock and that's the mythical firm that everyone is talking about now. What you could do now is instead of putting $7 of equity, you could actually put in $3.50 of equity. The treasury is going to put in another $3.50 of equity. The treasury is going to put in another $3.50 of equity. So far it looks a lot like everything I've described so far. So this is from the treasury. This program allows a further 100% of the equity-based loan from the treasury. So then the treasury will give, let me do loans in yellow. So the treasury is willing to give another $7 loan to this fund that we're creating. And now we have, once again, $14. And then this fund can then participate in the Legacy TALF program. And the Legacy TALF program involves the Fed essentially giving you this 6 to 1 ratio. And actually it's up to their discretion. So a lot of this is going to be opaque to us bystanders. But I have a sense that they're probably willing to give even more leverage. But let's say there's the same leverage that everything we talked about in that plan. So you're essentially going to have another $86 loan from the Fed, and I know it's getting messy, $86 loan. And now this manager, Pimrock, who only contributed $350, will control $100 of buying power. So this becomes 30 to 1 leverage, where the loan isn't just from the Fed anymore. This is the Fed loan, $86. But there's also a fairly large loan coming from the Treasury. A lot of people have emailed me and said, hey, what happens when these loans go bad and the Fed takes a hit, the FDIC becomes insolvent? Well, I think the FDIC knows the answer to that question. Anything issued by our dollar bills we have, those are Federal Reserve notes. They're issued by the Federal Reserve, but they're backed by the Treasury. So essentially the Federal Reserve is a government sponsored entity, just like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. It essentially says if the Federal Reserve or the FDIC ever goes bankrupt, the Treasury will take the hit. So really, even though this is a loan from the FDIC or from the Federal Reserve, it's being backed by the Treasury. So all of this is a loan from the American people, right here, essentially. And so this actually hugely changes the economics of kind of the put option relative to the video that I made here on the put option. An investor here, this is an equivalent put option, just so you get a sense of it. If you were going to pay $30 for something, in my previous video I said, well, instead you could put, this is non-guitener. This is a non-guitener reality. Now in this reality, if you are one of the select five individuals who are allowed to participate in this program, what you could do is you could put in $2.50. Let me make sure I get the numbers right. You could put in $2.25. Let me draw it out. You could put $2.25 of equity. The Treasury will put in $2.25 of equity. So that's what, $4.50. Then the Treasury will give you another $4.50 loan. So we have about $9.00. What is that? That's $4.50. We have $9.00. And then the Fed will give you a $51.00 loan. Let me do that in a magenta. So then the Fed will give you a $51.00 loan. And now you have $60.00 of buying power, which you could use to buy two of the securities you would have bought in the non-guitener scenario. And the reason why I say you want to buy two scenarios is because I want to show you that you get, because you have to split the equity. This goes to the Treasury. This goes to PIMROC. So since you have to split the equity, you actually want twice the large of a position to get the same upside. So this is a reality where PIMROC has only put $2.25 of capital at risk, but they're going to get the same upside as they would have gotten in the non-guitener scenario, putting $30.00 at risk. And you could work out the math. If this thing ends up being worth $40.00, then this thing ends up being, because you could have bought two securities with this, two $30.00 securities. So then this thing will become worth $80.00. So that $20.00 of profit, you had $60.00 before of assets, now they're worth $80.00. That $20.00 of profit would be split between PIMROC and the Treasury, so $10.00 of profit each. So in either case, you would benefit $10.00. But obviously in the downside scenario, these guys take most of the hit. But let's very quickly value that option. Because you could have either put just $30.00 of your capital at risk to invest in the security, or in this scenario, you could put $2.25 into the fund, and then you could have put, what is it, $27.75 in cash or Treasuries or essentially money that's not at risk. And the payoff diagram here will look something like this. That no matter what the price of the security, let's say that this axis is the price of the security, that's the price of the security, and then this is the value of your investment. So in this reality, it's just a line with slope 1. Where if your investment is $30.00, if the price of the security ends up being worth $30.00, your investment is at $30.00. If the price of your security ends up being $60.00, the value of your investment is $60.00. That's in the non-Geithner scenario. In the Geithner scenario, you make all of this money if your asset pays off. But if your asset price drops below $27.75 right there, you're made whole. Because you put $27.75 in cash. So the payoff diagram for the TALF's legacy loans or legacy security program looks something like this. And this is essentially you owning the security plus a put option. And just to value that put option, let's see. So if we say the stock price, the security price is $30.00. These aren't stocks, but these are securities. The strike price on your option, it's a put option at $27.75. You have the right to sell the security at $27.75. Interest rate, we can make it something pretty low, because we're not going to borrow. The dividend yield is pretty high on these things, because they're yielding a lot. And then the volatility, we could say it's pretty high. And then the time to expiration, we could also say it's pretty high. Because these are going to be 10-year options, essentially 10-year American options. Because you can exercise them at any point. And then when I hit calculate, I get the value of the option. And these are actually American put options. So $21.50, approximately. So for $30.00 security, the government between the Treasury and the Fed is giving an approximately a $22.00 free put option. And so they're essentially giving you an incentive to pay as much as well over 90% above the true value that you would have otherwise been willing to pay for the security. You'd be willing to pay. If you were neutral at 30, now you'd be willing to be neutral at $50.00 or $52.00 for each of these units of security. So this changes the economics dramatically. This by itself might actually close the bid-ask gap. But obviously, most of that is coming from a subsidy from the government. In the next video, I'll show you how this is actually a huge incentive also to game it. Because these Pimrock guys, these five fund managers, they also have a huge interest in participating in this plan, even if they thought that this was a bad investment. Because they can make so much money on the rest of their portfolio. And I'll do that in the next video. See you soon.
