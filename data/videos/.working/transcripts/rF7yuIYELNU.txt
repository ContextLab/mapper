I think it's going to be even more important to have the widest range of skill sets that you could have. So less specialization, more a jack of all trades, including design thinking, design work, together with that programming experience. And so that you can jump into the new technological advances that are being made every day. You know, we're going to be so much more in virtual reality. Can you not just use it, but can you program it? I think the most important ones will be curiosity and keen-eyed observational skills. See, curiosity fuels the question why, which is an essential part of every innovation. And keen observational skills allow us not to waste our efforts reinventing the wheel. Life has already solved so many of the toughest problems that the world can possibly throw at it. So why not figure out how biology has overcome an obstacle and adapt or improve on that?
