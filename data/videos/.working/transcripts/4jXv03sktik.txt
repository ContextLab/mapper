Now, the story of a young man teaching math to the world. News our correspondent Spencer Michaels reports. So this is a quadratic equation essentially. We're trying to find the zeros. This disembodied voice is heard every day by tens of thousands of students struggling with math, both in the U.S. and around the world. Thirty-three-year-old Salman Khan recently quit his job as a hedge fund analyst to devote himself to an unpaid job teaching math on the Internet. Welcome to the presentation on Basic Edition. I know what you're thinking. These are cancers or cancer cells. These are the investors in the mortgage-backed securities. He has posted 1,200 lessons on YouTube, which appear on an electronic blackboard and range in subject from Basic Edition and Advanced Calculus to Science and Finance. And they are free. Introduction to trigonometry is where I teach people about the trig functions. This is one of the more popular videos. This has 179,000 views. And this is just what sine, cosine, and tangent are. Khan lives in California's Silicon Valley with his wife, a rheumatologist in training at Stanford, and their new baby. He got the idea for Khan Academy four years ago when he taught a young cousin how to convert kilograms to grams. Many American students have trouble with math. Studies show they lag behind their counterparts in Asia and Europe in both math and science. With Khan's help, his cousin got good at math and he eventually had a new career tapping into anxieties around the world. Now he records his lessons from a converted closet in the back of his bedroom. He never goes on camera. It kind of feels like the voice in their head. You're looking at it, it kind of feels like someone's over your shoulder talking in your ear as opposed to someone at a blackboard that's distant from you. Although he is not the first person to teach on the internet, his simple operation has attracted more eyeballs than most university sites. For Khan, teaching math and science and finance is just the beginning. He's ready to expand his YouTube site to include whatever strikes his fancy. I want to do everything. I want to do history. I want to do grammar. I want to do literally every subject. So far, except for a little advertising revenue, he is donating his time and equipment. It's a one-man operation, but it's gotten so big he expects to start soliciting outside support to keep his academy growing.
