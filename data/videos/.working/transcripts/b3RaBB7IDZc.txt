Hello grammarians. Today we are going to talk skillfully and patiently about adverbs and what it is that adverbs do. And in order to do that I think it might be useful to talk about what adjectives do first. So adjectives can modify stuff, and I should have been clearer in the last video and said that the stuff they modify is nouns. But I didn't want to introduce too many rules and strictures. What adjectives modify is nouns. And only nouns. Adverbs modify everything else. So adverbs modify everything that's not a noun. And the way we usually see this applied is with verbs, and it's right there in the name to adverbs, and this comes from the Latin meaning on or to verbs. Action words. Adverbs are words that you slap onto verbs. Basically what I imagine when I think of adverbs is I kind of see like a sticker. Here's the sticker we've got we can say. Slowly. Slowly. So we can take this thing and turn it into a sticker. Boop. Move it around. Do what we like. So we can write a sentence like Grayson ran. Boop slowly. And slowly here refers back to ran. It's how he ran. It's not really describing Grayson. It's modifying or describing the action of running. Pearl arranged the furniture. Slowly. Boop. Little sticker that we just put on there. But a word is also considered an adverb if it modifies an adjective. So let's say adverbs modify verbs and adjectives. So we could say something like, Vanessa was very hungry. Right, because hungry is an adjective. And very is doing this thing where it's modifying hungry. It's not Vanessa wasn't very. You can't be very. Very is not an adjective. But it is a modifier. And the word that it's modifying is hungry. How hungry was Vanessa? Vanessa was very hungry. Vanessa could also be slightly hungry. And this leads me to one of the most important things about adverbs, which is that generally they tend to have L-Y on them. So generally the way to make an adverb is to just take an adjective and add L-Y to it. So you take the word slow, you add L-Y, you get the adverb slowly. You take the word nice, you add L-Y, you get the adverb nicely. You take the adjective cheerful, add an L-Y, you get the adverb cheerfully. So adverbs modify everything that isn't a noun. And that means that they modify verbs and adjectives. The way you make an adverb most of the time is by just taking an adjective and tacking on L-Y to the end of it. It's like a sticker that you put on top of a verb or an adjective. That's what adverbs are and that's what they do. And what you can do is learn anything. David out.
