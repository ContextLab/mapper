Hi, I'm Lauren from Khan Academy, and today I'm going to give you an overview of how to set up accounts for yourself and your children on Khan Academy. We'll also go over how you can find relevant content for your kids and view their progress. This video was meant for parents with kids who are 13 or older. If your child is 12 or younger, please see our other video called Parent Quick Start Tips for Kids Ages 12 and Under. We recommend that you and your child go through the account creation steps together and collaborate to come up with a plan for learning on Khan Academy. To begin, go to www.khanacademy.org and have your child click Sign Up in the upper right corner. On the sign up page, have your child enter their date of birth and sign up via Google or Facebook, or create a username and password and sign up with email. Next, your child can select their grade level and click Continue. On the next page, you'll see courses that we recommend for your child based on their grade level. Have them choose one or more and click Continue. You can also use the See All link to view the full menu in case your child would like to select other topics to interest them. Now your child is ready to go. They can click the blue Start button for any course to start with their very first lesson or click the See All link to browse the entire course. If your child is not sure where to start, here's a tip. Most Khan Academy math courses include a course challenge that can help you quickly find where your child needs practice and where they're already good to go. To get there, scroll to the bottom of the course page and click Start Course Challenge. Course usually take 30 to 45 minutes and will give you some good clues about where to direct their learning. You can also suggest to your child that they start one grade level below their current grade or even start at kindergarten and work their way up. If you would like to track your child's progress, you can create a parent account. Go to www.khanacademy.org and click Sign Up in the upper right corner. On the sign up page, select Parent. Now you can sign up with Google, Facebook, or you can sign up with email and create a username and password. Once you sign up, you'll be taken to your parent dashboard. Click Add a Child. Then click the My Child Already Has an Account link. Enter your child's email address and click Next. Your child will receive an email with a link to confirm the connection to your account. Once your child activates via the link, refresh your parent dashboard and click your child's username. This takes you to the Progress Report, where you can keep track of what they're learning and how much time they're spending. Your child can also see this report through their account by clicking Progress in the left navigation. Thanks for watching and we hope you and your child enjoy learning on Khan Academy!
