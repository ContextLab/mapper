Given g of x is equal to 8x plus two, find g of zero, g of negative five, and g of 2x plus three. So all this is when they say g of x is equal to 8x plus two, this is a function definition. They're saying you give me any x, and you input it into my function g, and my function g will output, it will associate with that number x, another number that happens to be 8x plus two. This is one way to create an association. It's going to associate, if you were to put one here, if this x is one, you're gonna do eight times one plus two, so you would associate one through g, you would associate one with eight times one plus two, which is 10. So it's just another way of creating an association that you could do with sets of ordered pairs, or you could do it graphically. But this is one of the most typical ways that you'll see a function defined. It says, look, input an x over here, and I'm going to output 8x plus two. So with that out of the way, let's think about what g of zero is. G of zero literally just means we're inputting zero into this function, and this function says whatever you're inputting, I'm going to output eight times that plus two. So g of zero is going to be, let me write it this way so it becomes clear what I'm doing, g of zero is going to be eight times zero, eight times zero, eight times zero plus two. So wherever we saw the x, we replaced it with whatever we're inputting. That is our x in this situation right over here. And so this is equal to eight times zero plus two is just equal to two. So g of zero is equal to two. Let me just write that here. G of zero is equal to two. Now let's try g of negative five. So let me write it this way. G of, I'll write g of negative five is equal to, and I'll try to do the color coding a little bit better this time, it's going to be equal to eight times our x, which in this case is negative five, eight times negative five plus two. Eight times negative five plus two. We're inputting a negative five, and we're going to output eight times negative five plus two. Wherever we saw the x, we just replaced it with a negative five. And this is just equal to eight times negative five is negative 40 plus two is equal to negative 38. So I'll write this over here on the right. We have g of negative five is equal to negative 38. Now, this last one is a little bit interesting. So we just did this one. Now let's do g of two x plus three. So now they're not inputting a number, they're inputting an expression. And what we have to do is everywhere where we see x here, we're going to replace it with that expression. If I did g of a circle, let me write this down. If I did g of an orange circle, an orange circle right over here, by this function definition, if I'm inputting an orange circle, I should output an orange circle, eight times the orange circle, eight times the orange circle, which doesn't make a lot of sense, but hopefully you get the idea that whatever you're inputting, you're just going to multiply it times eight and add two. So if we input two x plus three, we're going to output this times eight plus two. Wherever we see an x, we replace it with this right over here. So let's try that out. So now we have g of two x plus three, g of two x plus three is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to eight times whatever we're inputting, eight times whatever we're inputting plus two. If we're inputting an orange, if this was an orange, we'd put an orange here. If this is a negative five, we put a negative five here. If this is a zero, we put a zero here. In this case, we're inputting two x plus three into our function. So we put two x plus three where the x is right over there. So two x plus three. Whatever we input, this function says, multiply it by eight and add two. We're inputting two x plus three, multiply it by eight and then add two. And so this is going to be equal to, we just distribute the eight, we just distribute the eight and you get 16 x plus 24. And you still have this plus two out over here. You still have this plus two out over here. So this is going to be equal to 16 x, 16 x plus these two, you add them up, you get 26. So we can write over here, and I'll do that same color since it'll be consistent. We have g of two x plus three is equal to 16 x plus 26. And we're done. I know it can be confusing because you're inputting, you're replacing x with something that has x in it. But you really should just view this as if this was an orange ball or a star or even if this had y's in it. Wherever you see an x, you replace it with whatever you are inputting it. So in every instance, we replace the x with two x plus three.
