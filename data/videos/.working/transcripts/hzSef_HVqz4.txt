Let's say that we wanted to take the indefinite integral of x squared times three x minus one dx. Pause this video and see if you can evaluate this. So you might be saying, oh, what kind of fancy technique could I use? But you will see sometimes the fanciest, or maybe the least fancy, but the best technique is to just simplify this algebraically. So in this situation, what happens if we distribute this x squared? Well then, we're going to get a polynomial here within the integral. So this is going to be equal to the integral of x squared times three x is three x to the third, and then negative one times x squared is minus x squared, and then that times dx. And now this is pretty straightforward to evaluate. So this is going to be equal to the antiderivative of x to the third is x to the fourth over four. So this is going to be three times x to the fourth over four, I could write it that way, or let me just write it, x to the fourth over four. And then the antiderivative of x squared is x to the third over three, so minus x to the third over three, and this is an indefinite integral, there might be a constant there. So let me write that down, and we're done. The big takeaway is, you just have to do a little bit of distribution to get a form where it's easy to evaluate the antiderivative. Let's do another example. Let's say that we want to take the indefinite integral of, it's going to be a hairy expression, so x to the third plus three x squared minus five, all of that over x squared dx. What would this be? Pause the video again and see if you can figure it out. So once again, your brain might want to try to do some fancy tricks or whatever else, but the main insight here is to realize that you could just simplify it algebraically. What happens if you just divide each of these terms by x squared? Well then, this thing is going to be equal to, put some parentheses here, x to the third divided by x squared is just going to be x, three x squared divided by x squared is just three, and then negative five divided by x squared, you could just write that as negative five times x to the negative two power. And so once again, we just need to use the reverse power rule here to take the antiderivative. This is going to be, let's see, the antiderivative of x is x squared over two, x squared over two, plus the antiderivative of three would just be three x. The antiderivative of negative five x to the negative two. So we would increment the exponent by one, positive one, and then divide by that value. So it would be negative five x to the negative one, we're adding one to negative one, all of that divided by negative one, which is the same, we could write it like that. Well these two would just, you'd have minus and then you're dividing by negative one, so it's really just going, you can rewrite it like this, plus five x to the negative one, and you could take the derivative of this to verify that it would indeed give you that, and of course we can't forget our plus c, never forget that if you're taking an indefinite integral. All right, let's just do one more for good measure. Let's say we're taking the indefinite integral of the cube root of x to the fifth dx. Pause the video and see if you can evaluate this. Try to write it a little bit neater. X to the fifth dx, pause the video and try to figure it out. So here the realization is, well if you just rewrite all of this as one exponent, so this is equal to the indefinite integral of x to the fifth to the 1 3rd, I just rewrote the cube root as the 1 3rd power dx, which is the same thing as the integral of x to the, if I raise something to a power and then raise that to a power, I can multiply those two exponents, that's just exponent properties, x to the 5 3rds dx, many of you might have just gone straight to this step right over here, and then once again, we just have to use the reverse power rule. This is going to be x to the, we increment this 5 3rds by one, or we can add 3 3rds to it, so it's x to the 8 3rds, and then we divide by 8 3rds, or multiply by its reciprocal, so we could just say 3 8ths times x to the 8 3rds, and of course we have our plus c, and verify this. If you use the power rule here, you'd have 8 3rds times the 3 8ths, we just give you a coefficient of one, and then you decrement this by 3 3rds, or one, you get to 5 3rds, which is exactly what we originally had. So the big takeaway of this video, many times, the most powerful integration technique is literally just algebraic simplification first.
