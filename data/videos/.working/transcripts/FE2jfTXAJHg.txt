We've already learned that cellular respiration can be broken down into roughly three phases. Broke down to three phases. The first is glycolysis, which literally means the breaking down of glucose. And then this can occur with or without oxygen. If we don't have oxygen, then we go over to fermentation. We'll talk about that in the future. Go over to fermentation. In humans, it produces lactic acid. And in other types of organisms, it might produce alcohol or ethanol. But if we have oxygen, and for the most part, we're going to assume that we can proceed forward with oxygen. If there is oxygen, then we could proceed forward to the Krebs cycle. Sometimes called the citric acid cycle, because it deals with citric acid, the same thing that's in orange juice or lemons. And then from there, we proceed to the electron transport chain. And we learned in the first overview video of cellular respiration that this is where the bulk of the ATP is actually produced, although it uses raw materials that came out of these phases up here. Now what I want to do in this video is just focus on glycolysis. Just focus on glycolysis. And it's sometimes a challenging task, because you can really get stuck in the weeds. And I'll show you the weeds in a little bit, in the actual mechanism, and it can be very daunting. But what I want to do is simplify it for you, so you can have the big takeaways. And then we can appreciate. And then maybe when we look at the weeds of glycolysis, we can make a little bit more sense of it. So glycolysis, a really cellular respiration, it starts off with glucose. We know its formula. It's C6H12O6. And I could draw its whole structure. It would take a little time. But I'm just going to focus on the carbon backbone. So it is a ring, or it can be a ring. But I'm just going to draw it as six carbons in a row. Now there's two kind of important phases of glycolysis that are good to know. One I call the investment phase. And the investment phase actually uses two ATPs. It actually uses two ATPs. So the whole purpose of cellular respiration was to generate ATPs, but right from the get-go, I actually have to use two ATPs. But I use two ATPs, and then I'm going to essentially break up the glucose into two three-carbon compounds right here that actually also have a phosphate group on them. The phosphate groups are coming from those ATPs. They also have a phosphate group on them. This is often called, well, there's a lot of names for it out, sometimes called PGAL. You really don't have to know this. Or phosphoglyceraldehyde, really challenging my spelling skills right here. That's not that important to know. All you have to know is in this first phase, you use two ATPs. That's why I call it the investment phase, if we use a business analogy. Investment phase. And then each of these two PGAL molecules can then go into the payoff phase. So in the payoff phase, each of these PGALS turn into pyruvate, which is another three-carbon, but it's reconfigured. But the process of it going to pyruvate, and let me write pyruvate in blue, because this is something that's at least it's good to know the word. And I'll show you its structure in a second. Pyruvate, sometimes it's called pyruvic acid. Same thing, pyruvic acid. And that's essentially the end product of glycolysis. So you start off with glucose. In the investment phase, you end up in this phosphoglyceraldehyde, which essentially you broke up your glucose and you put a phosphate on either end of it. And then those each independently go through the payoff phase. So you end up with two molecules of pyruvate for every molecule of glucose you started off with. Now you're saying, hey, so that was a payoff phase. What was our payoff? Well, our payoff we got from this, let me write this down as a payoff phase. This is our payoff phase. And I apologize for the white background. I did it because the mechanism I'm showing you, I copy and pasted it from Wikipedia, and they had a white background. So I just ran with the white background for this video. But I personally at least like the black background a lot better. But this is the payoff phase right here. And so when we go from the phosphoglyceraldehyde to the pyruvate or the pyruvic acid, we produce two things. Or I guess we could say we could produce three things. We produce each of these, each of these p-gals to pyruvate produce two ATPs. So I'm going to produce two ATPs there. I'm going to produce two ATPs there. And then they each produce an NADH. And of course, they're not producing the whole molecule in a vacuum. Essentially what they're doing is they're starting with the raw material of an NAD+. So they start off with an NAD+. And they essentially reduce it by adding a hydrogen. Remember, we learned a couple of videos ago that you can view reduction as a gain in hydrogen. So the NAD gets reduced to NADH. And then later on, these NADHs are used in the electron transport chain to actually produce ATPs. So the big takeaway here, if I were to kind of write the reaction that we get for glycolysis, is that you start off with glucose. And you need some NAD+, and for every mole of glucose, you're going to need two NAD+. You're going to need two ATPs. So I'm just writing all the ingredients that we need to start off with. And then you're going to need, well, let me say, these guys are going to be ADPs before we turn them to ADPs. So I'll write plus 4 ADPs. And then after performing glycolysis, and let me write it here, let me write also, sorry, that was an AD, ADPs. Let me just rewrite that part right there. 4 ADPs. And then you maybe need two phosphate groups, or we're going to need four phosphate groups. Plus four, I'll just call them, sometimes they're written like that. But maybe I'll write it like this. Four phosphate groups. I'll do four phosphate groups like that. And then once you perform glycolysis, you have two pyruvates. You have two NADHs. The NAD has been reduced. It gained a hydrogen, R-I-G, oil rig. Reduction is gained in electron. But in the biological sense, we think of it gaining the hydrogen, because hydrogen is very non-electronegative. So you're hogging its electrons. You gained its electrons. So two NADHs. And then plus these two ADPs get used in the investment phase, that's why I kind of wrote them a little separately. So these two get used. So then you're left with two ADPs. And then these guys essentially get turned into ATPs, so plus four ATPs. I guess we didn't need four. We only needed a net of two phosphate groups, because two jump off of here, and then we need a total of two more to get four jumping on there. But the big picture is, you start with glucose. You end up with two pyruvates. You use up two ATPs. You get four ATPs. So you have a net of two ATPs formed. Let me write that very big. Net, what you get out of glycolysis is two ATPs. You get two NADHs that can each later be used in the electron transport chain to produce three ATPs. But you get two NADHs, and you get two pyruvates, which are going to be re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs that are going to be the raw materials for the Krebs cycle. But these are the outputs. These right here are the outputs of glycolysis. So now that we have that big picture, let's actually look at the mechanism, because this is a little bit more daunting when you see it here. But we'll see the same themes that I just talked about. We're starting with glucose, right there. It is a six chain. It's in a circle. It's in a ring. One, two, three, four, five, six carbons. I could write it like that, just to make it a huge oversimplification. Goes through a few steps. I use an ATP here. So let me do that in a color. We do it in orange, whenever I use an ATP. I use one ATP there. I use one ATP there. And just like I told you, they have a slightly different name for it. But this is the phosphoglyceraldehyde right here. They call it glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. It's the exact same molecule. But as you can see, when I drew it very roughly before, you've got one, two, three carbons there. And it also has a phosphate group on it. The phosphate group's actually attached to the oxygen. But just for simplification, I draw the phosphate group just like that. And I showed that right here. This was the phosphoglyceraldehyde right here. This is the actual structure up here. But I think sometimes when you look at the structure, it's easy to miss the big picture. And there are two of these. They kind of say that you can go back and forth with this other kind of isomer of this. But the important thing is that you have two of these compounds that are now three carbon compounds. Glucose has been split. And now we're ready to enter the payoff phase. And remember, you have two of these compounds right here. That's why when they drew this mechanism, they wrote times 2 right there. Because the glucose has been split into two of these molecules. So each of the molecules are now going to do this right here. And for each of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates, or PGALS, or phosphoglyceraldehyde, we can look at the mechanism. Say, OK, look here. There's going to be an ADP turning into an ATP there. So this is plus 1 ATP. And then we see it, again, happening here on our way to pyruvate right there. Then we have another plus 1 ATP. So for each of the PGALS, or the phosphoglyceraldehydes that were produced, we're producing two ATPs in the payoff phase. Now there were two of these. So total for 1 glucose, we're going to produce 4 ATPs in the payoff phase. So the payoff phase, 4 ATPs. In the investment phase, we used 1, 2 ATPs. So total net ATPs directly generated from glycolysis is 2 ATPs. 4 gross produced, but we had to invest 2 in the investment phase. And then the NADHs we see right here. For each phosphoglyceraldehyde, or glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or PGALS, or whatever you want to call them, at this stage right here, you see that we are reducing NAD plus to NADH. So this happens once for each of these compounds. And obviously there are two of these. Glucose got split into two of these guys. So two NADHs are going to be produced. And later, these are going to be using the electron transport chain to actually each produce 3 ATPs. And then finally, when everything is said and done, we're left with the pyruvates. And at least that, they made it nice and big. We can take a look at what a pyruvate looks like. And just as promised, we can look at all the oxygen bonds and all of that. But it is a 3-carbon structure. It has a 3-carbon back row bone. So the end result is that the glucose got split in half. It got oxidized. Some of the hydrogens got stripped off of it. As you can see, there's only three hydrogens here. We started off with 12 hydrogens and glucose. And now it has its carbon bonding more strongly with oxygen. So it's essentially having its electrons stolen by the oxygens or hogged by the oxygens. So carbon has gotten oxidized in this process. There's going to be more oxidation left to do. And in the process, we were able to generate two net ATPs and two NADHs that can later be used to produce ATPs. Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.
