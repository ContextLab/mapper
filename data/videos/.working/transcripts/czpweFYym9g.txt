- [David] On the contrary,
my good wordsmiths, you thought you were in for
an ordinary vocabulary video. Well, friends, you are quite mistaken. Allow me to correct the record because the word we're
talking about is contradict. - No, it isn't. - [David] Stop that. It is, it's a verb. And it means deny
something, speak against. - No, it doesn't. Uh-uh, it means the opposite. - [David] Okay, knock that off. Who are you? - I'm the imp of contradiction. I contradict everything you say. - [David] That's terrible. - It's great. - [David] Okay, please don't
leave, imp of contradiction. - Oh, yeah. Now, I'm out of here. - [David] Right. This word comes from two Latin parts. Contra meaning against and dicta meaning to
speak, which we usually see as dic or dict. So contradiction is speaking
against something, saying, no, that's wrong. The opposite is true. If I said the sky we're
green, you would contradict me and say, no, David, it's blue. Or no, David, it's black, it's nighttime. Or maybe I could contradict you right back and say, no, we're having a tornado. This guy is for real green right now. Let's get to shelter. Now, let's see what related words you can get out of contradict
and it's word parts. So I'm gonna put on some music and you go put on some words, 10 seconds. Let's go. (upbeat music) Here are three I came up with. Indicate to point out
to say that's the one, contrast, to show the
difference between two things, to put one against the other and say this apple is
different from this mango and dictionary, a book of all the words
in a language, right? All the words that people say. Now, let's use contradict
in some sentences. When Vanessa said that
it was sunny outside, Orlando contradicted her. "Look outside," he said, "It's pouring." Right? Orlando is correcting Vanessa by saying the opposite
of what you said is true. Contradiction is about
saying the opposite. In that vein, let's try another one. The Imp of contradiction
denies everything you say. - I do not. - [David] Ah, there you are. Watch this. I'm not wearing a hat. - You're wearing a cowboy hat. - [David] I live in Washington DC. - You live on the moon. - [Instructor] You see,
saying the opposite. All right, until next time,
you can learn anything. David out. - Imp of contradiction in. - [David] Hey, Imp, can
I ask you a question? - [Imp] No. - [David] Why do you do it? - [Imp] It's a living.
