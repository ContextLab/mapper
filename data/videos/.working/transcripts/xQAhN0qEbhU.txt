Hello and welcome to the LearnStorm growth mindset live stream. I'm Rachel a senior communications manager at Khan Academy and I am so excited to welcome you to the Khan Academy offices here in sunny California. Today's live stream is going to be about 60 minutes and we're going to split it up into two parts. Up first we're going to cover the LearnStorm program, what it's all about and what it can do for your classroom. Next we'll turn our attention to our fabulous panel to answer your questions about growth mindset. But first a few tips. If you have any questions about growth mindset or LearnStorm please type your questions and comments and our helpful moderators will answer your questions. For those who were trying to view by YouTube I'm really sorry we were having some technical problems so we're just on Facebook for the moment. But our questions might be asked to our panel later on. I also very much recommend that you maximize your screen. We'll be going through a few of the growth mindset activities and you'll definitely want to see them in full effect. And lastly if you can't stay for the full live stream we'll miss you but don't worry we'll record it and we'll send out the recording later on this week. I have three amazing guests with me today that I'll introduce in just a few moments but first let me share with you a little about LearnStorm. LearnStorm is Khan Academy's free back-to-school program that gives teachers a powerful way to jumpstart the school year. By combining mindset activities and skills practice across subjects, LearnStorm motivates classrooms and builds students confidence. And yes you can still sign up for LearnStorm through October so hop to it if you haven't already. There's also some time to win some awesome prizes. This year all across the US teachers and their students can sign up for LearnStorm. LearnStorm and Khan Academy are free and always will be. LearnStorm is possible thanks to the awesome support of MathWorks. So thank you MathWorks. LearnStorm can be implemented flexibly by teachers as in class practice, for homework, or for both. But in order to get the most out of LearnStorm please follow these steps. One, sign up and assign. Two, master skills. Three, build mindsets. And four, celebrate progress. Of course in order to even participate you must sign up for Khan Academy by going to khanacademy.org and enroll in LearnStorm from your coach dashboard. Once you have your account all set up with your class and students, teachers can assign all the content available on Khan Academy including grammar, history, biology, not just math. In addition to core K through 12 subjects, LearnStorm includes access to Khan AP lessons created by former AP teachers and AP exam reviewers covering subjects like AP Physics, AP Calculus, AP Government and Politics and more. And then don't forget to enroll your class in LearnStorm. Next it's time for you and your students to master skills. Regardless of the way your teachers decide to implement LearnStorm, teachers can track student participation, get real-time insights and when someone is struggling. This enables teachers to spend more time differentiating instruction and providing targeted help with learners of all levels. This picture is of Miss Coda of Watsonville, California. She participated in LearnStorm last year and you can hear all about her experience on our website at learnstorm.khanacademy.org. Thirdly, the topic of the hour growth mindset. This year based on feedback from teachers who use activities last year, we have not one but two curriculums based on age group. In the elementary middle school curriculum, students have seven activities to learn alongside this brain character, Pinky Pinky and his friends. We'll scroll through one of these awesome activities now, which were created in partnership with PERTZ, a standard research center. Each activity has articles, videos and these are essential reflection points where students can really take a moment to internalize and apply these concepts to their lives. In the high school curriculum, students have new lessons on belonging and will learn through testimonials and case studies. We also have focus on highlighting people from many different backgrounds and diverse experiences so students can learn from a full spectrum of experiences. We've also made a comprehensive teacher guide and lesson plans that include bell ringers, class discussions, sample communications to parents. You can assign all of these growth mindset activities by clicking assign in the upper right hand corner and the students complete activities, they develop learning strategies and build confidence to overcome challenges in the classroom and beyond. The growth mindset activities are a chance for you to make a lasting change in students lives and as they continue into adulthood, just so very important. Lastly, the cherry on the Sunday celebrating. The biggest part of LearnStorm which has led to many classroom celebrations is the LearnStorm tracker. Here's how it works. Access the LearnStorm tracker from the LearnStorm banner on your teacher or coach dashboard. Once you click on the blue button, you should be taken to your class LearnStorm tracker. We've included a demo for you to see what it's all about. As your students complete assignments on the Khan Academy with your assigned to them, the rings on the LearnStorm tracker will populate and fill up. Once your students have completed a set of number of assignments based on the number of students in your class, their ring will fill up and celebrations will occur. This year there are a near infinite number of rings which means there are so many moments for celebration, encouragement, or perhaps friendly competition between a neighboring class. Each ring is three times the number of students in your class. Students get super excited regardless of the age and we've even seen students jump out of their seats in celebration. For a limited time, LearnStorm a learning start of LearnStorm, we have growth mindset activities that you can also assign to your class to receive credit in your LearnStorm tracker. Alright, enough from me. I am very excited to introduce our panel who will tell us more about growth mindset. Alright, today we have Dave Ponescu, founding director of PERTZ, a center at Stanford University that helps educators apply insights from the behavioral sciences to create safe and engaging learning environments that foster student motivation and resilience. Annie Brock, a former teacher and author of the growth mindset coach, a month-by-month guide of how to implement mindset in your classroom. Anne Samela Robinson, a current fourth grade teacher in Independence, Missouri who has developed many creative ways to help her students learning mindset. So welcome to our panel. So my first question is for Dave, can you tell us more of what is growth mindset? Yeah, so growth mindset is really the belief that our abilities and our intelligence are something that we can grow by applying effort to the right effort appropriately to the right kinds of learning strategies. And it's distinguished usually from a fixed mindset, which is to believe that our abilities and our intelligence are fixed. They're something like eye color, something that we really can't change about ourselves. Now it's important to know that growth mindset isn't to believe that everyone's the same or that everyone's equally intelligent or learns the same way. Rather is to believe that no matter how smart you are you can always become smarter by learning from your mistakes and challenging yourself to learn more. Very good. And I guess this is a question for Annie and Sam. Why is growth mindset important for students? I think growth mindset is just really essential for students because so many students come to school with us feeling limitations whether they put them on themselves or they put them on or they've been put on by someone else. And I think when students develop growth mindsets they start to understand that their possibilities are limitless. That with hard work and effort they can make great achievements in school. There's a quote in Carol Dweck's book Mindset that a person's true potential is unknown and unknowable and it's impossible to foresee what can be accomplished with years of passion, toil and training. And that's like my personal teaching mantra because I want to enter school every day and just feel like I'm not I'm not gonna limit any kid. Any kid can achieve anything if they want to put in the work. And you know when you're a student and you go into the classroom and you look around and there's 20 or 25 other learners it's really easy to get in that fixed mindset space where you're looking around and contemplating like why is why does this come so quickly to her? Why is he so great at this? And it's so hard for me. It's easy to tell yourself the story that oh they're just blessed with that ability or oh they they just have some natural talent or natural affinity for math or art or music or whatever. It's hard to reckon with the the truth that effort is what leads to achievement but we have to care about our students enough not to let them get away with the easy thing which is just to believe that they're not cut out for it. And I just think it's so important to bring growth mindset into our schools and into our classrooms because when we give kids the tools the language of growth mindset the tools to youth use growth mindset and they're learning they learn how to put in effort to push hard to fight to achieve goals and their kids who are achieving goals will turn into adults who achieve goals and we need adults who are tenacious and willing to to solve difficult problems and so that starts that starts in our classrooms. I think the great thing about growth mindset is it gives every single child hope. It's no longer this mindset of okay those are the kids who are smart and I'm never going to be one of them. Everyone is on a journey. Everyone can learn and Annie kind of touched on this at the beginning of the year I described knowledge to my kids as a sphere to help them visualize it and there's an infinite number of doors on the sphere. We've all got these keys and it can be so frustrating to look over and watch your friend put their key in and turn and the door opens yet when you put your key in it doesn't work. That's not where we stop though that's where you get with your teacher and we are going to figure this out we're going to figure out how our brain works and we're going to keep going because you deserve that moment where you put your key in and all your effort has paid off and that door finally turns and the great thing about growth mindset is embedded within it is goal-setting its reflection and we're truly empowering our kids to be lifelong learners not just fourth grade learners. Right so I guess for Annie and for Dave there's so much out there about growth mindset what is important for teachers to focus in on when fostering a growth mindset for students? Yeah so I think a really great place to start is by laying the foundation by helping them really understand that the brain is malleable really helping them understand the neuroscience behind growth mindset so again I think that's that's really just a foundation so that's a great place to start and I think the the LearnStorm growth mindset activities really do a good job of laying that foundation but then I think it's really important to go to go deeper than that too and I think what teachers can do to do that is to create this growth mindset culture which is characterized by being a really a safe place for students to feel like they can make mistakes and where they can challenge themselves without worrying about how their teacher will see them or how their how their peers will see them. It's a place where where they'll feel like like their mistakes will be will be celebrated as long as they're learning from them and where they're where growth is prioritized over proficiency. I think what teachers can do is they can really make it obvious that in their class the thing that matters most is how much they're learning and that they're there that their relationship with their students isn't one of judge but rather one of coach so a lot of the time students worry that their teacher they really see their teacher as a judge someone who's there to evaluate whether they're a good learner or bad learner whether they're smart or dumb but when they see their teachers as a judge in that way they can really get in the way of learning because it's very hard to be vulnerable if you're really worried about about how the person will see you to ask for help but in contrast if a teacher really creates this kind of growth mindset culture and really really talks to their students and helps them see themselves see them as their coach as someone who's really there to bring out the best in them and help them grow the most then that really changes the way students feel about challenging themselves and helps them feel much more confident and comfortable really putting themselves out there and challenging themselves yeah I agree with everything Dave said and I you know I would also number one is just teaching kids like what the mindsets are giving them the understanding of how learning actually happens in their bodies how how their brains work what equipment we all have the process of creating connections in our brain is the same for everyone so just giving them that knowledge is key and then secondly giving them challenging work and that's gonna look differently for every kit challenging there's many definitions in a classroom of what challenging work is but giving them challenging work and then supporting them as they meet the high expectations that you've set for them in doing that you're creating a growth mindset culture because you know truly if the work is easy the mindset is irrelevant if kids are just breezing through things so if you to foster to me a growth mindset classroom looks like lots of chances on your path to mastery lots of chances to get it right a teacher who's modeling growth mindset so talking through the process talking through your struggles and valuing growth over perfection and I love how you talked about normalizing mistakes or or looking at mistakes as an opportunity to learn I have a funny story I was chatting with some Khan Academy ambassadors and a teacher said that she had taught her second grade class about what growth mindset was and and they're working towards like looking at mistakes and failure is just a part of learning and and you know you teach these things and you tell the kids these things and you and you're not sure if it's resonating until it you know they it comes back to you in some form and she said one kiddo who started the year with a little bit of a fixed mindset came in with some homemade science that said this is a mistake making place but making was spelled m-a-k-e-i-n-g and I know that's such a good story I'm like that's such a great example of what growth mindset looks like it is it is trying it's putting yourself out there it's being being vulnerable and I can't imagine what kind of amazing classroom that teacher has where a kid internalizes that and then is willing to just show up and put himself out there so so I you know you can foster growth mindset and in your classroom in a bunch of different ways but to me it looks like what is growth mindset giving challenging work setting high expectations and then being that support structure for the kids to achieve their goals well thank you thank you for sharing that story that sounds like a really amazing way to foster learning it's our the best environment that we want for all of our students which is so great Dave I know you know that we Khan Academy worked with you a lot on these growth mindset activities can you give me some highlights of the curriculum yeah so I mean it was really fun first of all working on that curriculum with the Khan Academy team I always enjoy that so I mean I think one thing I really appreciate about it is that it really I think does a good job of hitting a lot of the main themes that are important for lay that for laying that foundation for a growth mindset and it does it in a really fun and engaging way in part in no small part thanks to thinking pinky who's a great great character to have accompany you on this ride but yeah you know it really hits at some of the scientific evidence behind the growth mindset it really helps students understand how powerful mistakes can be how they can really be allies in this learning journey if you take time to really reflect on them and really understand what that means what opportunities you have to learn better and to better develop it also helps students set ambitious goals because if you're you know if you're not really challenging yourself and it doesn't matter if you have a growth mindset if you're just thinking a boy sure could grow but if you're not you know doing things that actually challenge you to grow you won't and so I think it helps students set those goals and really understand why doing that is important and then I think last but not least and also really you know when you when you're really doing that when you're going for those ambitious goals and pushing yourself you're gonna struggle and you're going to get frustrated sometimes and there's also really good advice there for students and for teachers around how to deal with those inevitable struggles that come up when you're really pushing yourself and I guess Sam just first for those teachers who are watching who were like I'm I need some practical applications of how to do this and like what's happening now you participated in learnstorm for a couple years now what are you looking forward to for learnstorm and the growth mindset activities for this year well I really like that there's been a bit of a shift in the learnstorm and that now they are aligned to elementary middle school and high school and I think that helps a tremendous amount you know we spend so much time at the beginning of the year doing these direct lessons where we're talking about what's actually happening in your brain and what's happening in your body when you become stressed and dealing with the frustrations and everything and we do all these different activities and then just at the perfect time learnstorm comes in and the kids get to hear that information in a different way and interact with it in a different way and although the growth mindset videos and and articles are phenomenal for me personally the best part about learnstorm is what happens right after that when the application piece comes in when we're doing math or coding or grammar or whatever we're working on and they go to do their assignments and there's such a presence of class synergy because if you want to see my class suddenly get silent and excited my class matter manager Maddie she'll go up to the board and they watch her like on pins and needles because they know she's getting ready to push a check progress and they want they want those rings to fill so badly and they know that every single one of them contributed to that happening and it you know I love though that Dave mentioned dealing with the frustrations I had a student who just she was like just tell me how to do this one she just she didn't want to do it on her own and they know that I won't do that like I'm here for you talk let's talk through it tell me don't tell me what you don't know tell me what you do know and working through it and that she left that day totally frustrated and came back the next day could not wait to grab her Chromebook ran over said she'd figured it out popped it in and it was correct and she was the class hero in that moment and I asked her I said how do you feel right now she's like oh I feel so good I did this I said I would have you wouldn't have felt like that if I just told you the answer if they're taking those little moments to let your kids feel that intrinsic motivation I think it's really really powerful in the classroom and learn storm kind of gives us that framework at the beginning to really help establish that's what this is like in this classroom right that's amazing and can I just ask like I said that's right for as a teacher what is that moment like for you to experience to see your students kind of learn and experience that you know there's a game out of emotions when you watch your kiddos learn because you feel frustrations along with them and and you feel the discouragement to I have a young man who really has he has a lot of intense emotions you know that he's learning to deal with as a lot of our kids do and he was so frustrated because on an assignment that we had did he got one out of seven and he was just so down and I was like buddy your neurons found a path you got one you know and he was like what you know not very impressed with that response I said you know we're gonna do this again I want to see if your neurons can find another path and get two and he got three and then he said go away all right so I went to help other kiddos and a little bit later he came to me and he said I need you to close your eyes and he led me back to his computer and I'm surprised and he had tears running down his face and it said seven out of seven and in that moment like that's why we're teachers and that's why we do what we do and that's what we strive for you know for him to feel that moment and know he did it on on his own and he gave his brain the time to learn and allow his his neurons to find those pathways and it's the other kids see that too and and it empowers them as much like I can do this dude go away go ahead I got it so there's a there's a litany of emotions you feel as a teacher as well you know you feel the frustrations with them there's nothing better than the kid that they've got it I love that it definitely seems just from hearing you all talk and kind of our earlier conversations that there's definitely a certain sort of bravery that has to happen on both the side of the teacher and the student when participating in these growth mindset activities right you have to trust that your students can do this and that they can learn and that it's okay to watch them struggle a little bit and then on the other end for these students to it's okay for them to struggle and to work through things and I think that's a beautiful lesson I'm not just in class but just in general so this question we have from Helen in Utah and I will throw this question to Sam and perhaps everyone with the demands on the time of day where do you fit in a growth mindset activities and what is your favorite activity so at the beginning of the year you do have to make time to do direct lessons 15 25 minutes a day it can involve a mentor text such as ish or beautiful oops or you know the great mistake any of those or it can be my kids really like I actually will show them scans of brains and we will talk about what's happening they learn about the neurons they learn about the parts of the brain and what they're responsible for and it's a really powerful moment for them because a lot of kids come and they villainize themselves I'm not smart whereas this gives them okay no this is what's happening in my brain and I can grow from this and so we start with that platform and that does take direct instruction time at the very beginning of the school year probably a couple weeks and we try to do a lot of activities along with them we will read ish and then paint on a canvas we make calm down jars where the kids will put glitter and beads in a jar in their favorite food coloring and talk about calming our brain you know we talk about our body releases stress cortisol when we're stressed and we can't think and so we do a lot of these activities at the beginning it really devote the time to it and I know we don't have a lot of time as teachers but the payoff is ten fold from there it really is about embedding it into just how you speak to your kids and how you ask them to speak not only to you but mostly to themselves my students have on their desk a picture of themselves holding a sign they created that says yet and at the beginning I got to point to that picture a lot because they they they self-doubt and they talk so negatively to themselves so I can't do this and I'll point you in the sand I can't do it yet and then we work really hard to say okay we can sit here all day talking about the things we don't know let's start on this problem what do you know you know and it's more it's not about something you do separate from that point it's how you empower your students and how you talk to them and how you expect them to talk to themselves and that's really the rest of the year it's not something extra anymore it's just the environment of your classroom your vocabulary their vocabulary and I tell them I will never let anybody be mean to you especially yourself and I think a lot of kiddos doesn't mean it to themselves right I I agree with everything that Sam said I think like in terms of like concrete activities that you can do definitely direct instruction for teaching what is growth mindset and giving them giving them that vocabulary those tools understanding how their brains work that requires some direct instruction up front but totally agree that if you do that little front-loading piece and then you work really hard to embed growth mindset into your culture it's not necessarily a kind of activity but it's you know for for me I think like any type of any type of lesson or activity that requires iterative thinking or trial and error is going to allow them to experience a little struggle experience like trying testing something it works it doesn't work and going back to the drawing board any type of like collaborative activities are really great for for working with one another project-based learning where there's not necessarily a right answer and just coming up with solutions the the breakouts I think are really great for getting and or any opportunity for the kids to have some productive struggle when you create a challenge that may be a little just beyond their capabilities and let them grapple with that a little bit and those are all good opportunities but there should just be things that we're doing every day that there's always chances and I always think that that the important pieces that we debrief afterwards and we talk about what what was your learning like what did what did it feel like how did you push through the difficult parts and I I think as a learner in my experience as a learner anyway those most difficult experiences are the most memorable experiences they're the ones that I walk away like I did it you know I I got through that even if it ended up being you know a C in algebra to me when it felt like there was no hope you know walking out of there and knowing that I had had got it or had had grown that's a really rewarding experience so so just embedding it in the culture of your classroom and in everything you do is so important right what did anything dad no I think that's great okay sure I was gonna say one of one of my favorite things about what you both said is just the the idea that we can kind of have this generation of students who don't have to unlearn these kind of bad kind of mentalities about themselves and internalize that and like what kind of young people can we unleash on the world if they were just super positive about what they could accomplish it's so amazing I love it all right Scarlett from Georgia asked what is the best way to get students excited about growth mindset I will throw this one to Annie and Sam so I think to get to get kids excited is number one just I think Sam was saying earlier I'm gonna steal steal what we were talking about but I think I'm missing earlier that kids come to already feeling excited about their potential or if they come to feeling down about their potential if you could teach them about how their brains work and how you know with efforts and hard work they can make accomplishments and make gains in their learning that gets them excited especially when they see progress it doesn't necessarily have to be you know like a party to get excited about it but you know I think I think we all are excited about our own potential and when you bring that passion and into the classroom and you're developing relationships with the kids and and growing those bonds and showing them that you believe in in their capabilities teaching them how to believe in themselves and how to reframe and refocus how to be mindful about how they learn best and apply those strategies and and give them opportunities to struggle and come out on top I think kids get excited about about learning and about their own their own possibilities and capabilities I think so and you know as adults sometimes we haven't put ourselves in situations in a while often that that kids are in every day where we are struggling and we don't get something and we want to get it if you forgot what that feels like I encourage you to go take a class outside the normal because there's not a worse feeling in the world than seeing everybody else get it and you giving it your all but you don't get it and so growth mindset empowers kids to know that that's not the period that's not the end of the story right you know that and that doesn't define me this is a part of my journey and watch me go right I think modeling and sharing I there's lots of teachers have success with sharing stories of like famous failures so like Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team or Harry Potter was rejected ten times or Abraham Lincoln lost its first bid for the you know Illinois House of Representatives or whatever it is like sharing those stories and letting kids know like like nobody has like a seamless upward trajectory in life we all have this kind of rocky path that we take there's ups and downs and and the journey towards success and it requires a lot of that I think that gets them excited to hopefully I think fail with your kids you know a lot of schools and now we're doing failure Fridays and I'd love failure Fridays you know the teacher too we're all learners and we're gonna try something completely out of the norm for 15 minutes we're gonna juggle we're going to try to cook something we're going to paint we're gonna try to just do all sorts of various things that might be outside the norm and demonstrate to them that you can't do it right away either and you know what congratulations we failed now what right I love that part like the now what part that's very very encouraging I remember that when I fail at many of the things I try yes go ahead I was gonna say I know that some teachers will actually make a point to intentionally make mistakes in front of their students so that they can really model for them you know when their students call them out and say hey that was a mistake they can model for them they kind of really adaptive response to that and say oh yeah you're right that wasn't a mistake help me help me fix that you know what did I do wrong and that could really be this kind of magical time when teachers can be vulnerable for their students and really model that it's okay to make mistakes and that the important thing is really learn from learn from each other and learn from those mistakes right yeah I think that's very true because you know I think a lot of teachers feel that they have to kind of be kind of perfect and kind of the front of the classroom and they want to you know kind of project this image and I think students learn so much better when they have someone to relate to and they're like oh I see I see someone that I can kind of grow towards which is really great I have a question from Sarah from Bonnie Beret Virginia Sarah asked how can I best support a learner with disabilities like ADHD Asperger's and so on with concrete examples scaffolding in growth mindset that's a really great question I'm gonna throw it up to the whole panel to answer that question I think any any kid can understand like the the basics of how how we learn and what growth mindset is I mean as yeah I've seen as young as preschoolers like understand that concept and what growth mindset is and how it happened how learning happens in our bodies and once you start with that foundation I think it's just really important to let let kids know that learning is a journey and the journey is different for every person growth mindset is not trying hard and winning every time like you know people sometimes have that idea that that's what it is being successful and making achieve getting success or achievements look different for every person for some people I got an email from a lady after I wrote a book on growth mindset and she said well you know I have a friend and and she struggles with the learning disability and it took her four times to pass algebra class and so growth mindset doesn't work and I said well she passed it you know it just took four times and really it's about us changing what our definition of success looks like because for for a lot of teachers it's just getting an A plus a success for a lot of parents getting an A is six equals success but we have to look at it in a different way sometimes it's starting with a 32% and ending up with a 75% getting one right and then keep working at it until you get seven right you know it's it's a process and I think no matter my my own son struggles with reading and we talk about what the way that you learn reading is going to be different from other people it might take you a little longer to get it you might have to employ some different strategies that other kids don't have to to do but you'll get there it's just that this is your road this is your path and and you have to embrace that right okay any sorry I think I love everything she said you know one of my students after a lesson one day made a comment Daisy she said that even if she's she redefined the way she was thinking and she goes I'm not gonna think about losing the same way anymore I said tell me more about that what do you mean she goes if I lose but I look at why do I think I lost and what can I do better next time she goes I'm gonna start counting that half-winning I thought that was wonderful in my class you've kind of adopted that and I love what you said about we we kind of need to redefine success it may not look like okay it's a hundred percent on the spelling test every time it's about growth for every child where are you and where do you want to be it's about putting that goal setting and that reflection in and every child moving forward you know no matter where they are we have a question from Michelle from Juniper California what is the best way to get parents on board with the idea of growth mindset this is such a really important question because I think growth mindset can look very different for many parents who may not have seen it before it may not have heard it before so how do you get them on board for this I can start with with one thought so I think exactly I think for a lot of parents it really is very different than what they're used to and they might not understand is this my kids teacher just making up this all this new stuff and that looks totally different than what I'm used to and it might be very alien and so I think a good place to start might be really with just explaining all the research behind growth mindset I mean not only that this is true about our brains but also how what an empowering impact that has on kids motivation how kids on one one's they once they learn to internalize a growth mindset how they're really under being much more likely to challenge themselves to learn from their mistakes they to take more challenging classes to do well in class right so it's so the end of the day it's a it's a very it's really an evidence-based approach to building students motivation and ultimately their achievement too so I think even parents who are really you know sticklers for the end of the day I want my kid to learn the most well if that's what you want then this is actually how you get there it's by it's by helping by by removing the fear from learning that might otherwise constrain them and growth mindset and growth minds of cultures can really just do such a fantastic job of of helping kids really feel empowered and unleashed to learn at their best and to really see themselves growing rather than than being afraid of of doing poorly and so I think that's like a great starting point and then and then I know these two have some great suggestions we have to look at home as an extension of the classroom and vice versa and so I think just giving giving to giving parents that the tools to understand what growth mindset is why we do it it's an evidence-based approach and then giving them teaching them strategies to help them and a lot of times that comes down to just talking to your kids so you know it there's kind of the old cliche like you ask your kid what'd you do today or what did you do today at school nothing how was it fine you know you always hear that but if parents can be intentional about how they talk to to their kids after school I always ask my kids and I we have a running thing so every day after school I say best worst and weirdest and so they have to tell me their best thing their worst thing and their weirdest thing which ends up with a lot of funny stories but it also gives us an opportunity to kind of dive into okay so something didn't go very well why not what what was the catalyst for that not going well or something went great what kind of strategies did you use to pull it off I mean how did you prepare how did you study how did you handle that tricky situation on the playground or whatever but talking to your kids instead of just you know good job a on the test ask them like like how did you prepare for this what kind of learning went into this and and likewise that they didn't do so well like let's let's talk about what happened and so really helping parents build that communication with their kids about strategies for for learning and and what works and what doesn't and just and and having them draw the the link between effort and achievement is really important so that kids are hearing it everywhere they go very good best worst weirdest I love that cool Annie I'm sorry Sam and I think the bottom line too when it comes to parents is they are sending us the most precious gift they have and there is nothing worse of a feeling than being a parent and seeing your child struggle in reading or struggling math and you want so badly to fix it for them but you don't know how and so sometimes when these parents come to us and they're frustrated and they just want it fixed they're coming from a place of love and we have to train them to you know because they'll come upset my child is not a good reader or my child's not gonna matter well now and yet right so what are we gonna do you know there really is if you really want to see the kids just go far a strong partnership between the kiddo the teacher and the parent you know you've got a big support system there to really hold up and then it comes down to what what any was talking about earlier all right we've got our support system holding you now let's go for some effort right right exactly that's what sounds like a really strong kind of foundation when you have that that sounds beautiful we have a question from Alyssa B how would you recommend facilitating and encouraging other faculty to promote growth mindset so this is a good question of like what do you do kind of in your actual school environment I think being transparent and being vulnerable teachers work really hard and we do not have a lot of time in the day and it's you know sometimes it's really easy to hear something and think that's just another thing so I think by being transparent and allowing people to come into your classroom or see see the fruits of your kids labor let your kids lead things you know let your kids be the ones who go out and talk about things because that's where that's where the power lies and that's where you show that these mountains are being moved and then I think also being vulnerable being able to go to a meeting and say guys I'm really working on growth mindset but I really feel like I personally am failing here I need some help and having those open discussions I think encourage more people you know we talked about our students feeling safe but it's the same thing with the staff the teachers we've got to feel safe to kind of embark on this because it's uncomfortable at the beginning and it's a new way of thinking and speaking and there's a big power shift right from the teacher to the kiddos and that's nerve-wracking at the beginning right but it it's such a positive power shift scared to take at the beginning right getting administrators and on it too I really believe that just like people approach things with a growth and fixed mindset that a school has a organizations have a growth or fixed mindset and a lot of times you don't have to look further than like the handbook to figure out like what are we valuing here are we valuing growth are we valuing perfection and so getting a good gauge on what is being valued and how are only the kids who are getting on the A honor roll are they the ones that are being celebrated do we have ways of celebrating kids who are making less or making incremental steps toward growth like do we celebrate that at all in our culture and so as a teacher I think you have an opportunity to feature admins and say we need to refocus and celebrate and like Dave said this is evidence but this is research-based and there is a strong body of research going back what 30 or 40 years that that supports this as a valuable learning intervention and just sharing that and being you know being an advocate for it in your school I think is is key to changing the culture of the entire school right yeah the only thing I would add is just that I mean I think the when I've talked to teachers who have kind of kind of catalyzed these kinds of cultural transformations of their schools I think a lot of the time it's really happened with just a handful of teachers who really started doing it and they really started modeling it and going and talking to other teachers about it and and and just you know it took it took some time it wasn't like a we're all gonna do growth mindset all at once I think in my experience that usually doesn't work very well it's usually more that you you kind of you kind of start around this kind of core crystal group of teachers and then it kind of branches off from there and as other teachers can see the kind of amazing things that can happen and and then they start to say hey maybe maybe that could work in my class actually I'd like to have my kids be that inspired or that motivated actually I'm very curious to know for Sam what made you'd want to try out these growth mindset activities like what was the catalyst for that it actually stemmed in the beginning it was I noticed that my kiddos were coming without tools and at the time I was in fifth grade and I had to send you know my babies off to middle school and I wanted them as empowered and with as many strategies as they could possibly have before they went because middle school can be really difficult years and so I started looking at things like their perseverance how do they speak to one another how do they advocate for themselves when they need something and we started little by little looking at things like that and I started really kind of trying to research and find things to support that and it's funny you know we watched beginning there I show my kids a video of a really famous quantum theorist who you know he's melted science and math and he's been working on the same equation now for 12 years and I promise my kids I will never make you work on an equation but if he can do 12 years we can do 20 minutes and we started trying to like build that stamina and then it just kind of grew from there and it was kind of the perfect timing you know Annie's book came out Carol Dweck's book coming out you know Pertz is really on the stage now learn storms out and it was just it feels like a lot of us were seeking this right if you look at the manifestation of what is really come to the surface so I think a lot of teachers at the same time really were feeling the same need right that's beautiful all right I'm glad we can help fill that need that makes me feel good Lee Ann Morgan from Ontario ask are there words and phrases that foster growth that I can include in my student conversations I think actually all of you have touched upon this idea of vocabulary so let's see if we can try to touch on that I'm a firm advocate of power of yet they had any time they say any kind of negative talk I'll point to them yeah you know and then they have to say it and then we're big on all right now what or great what do you need we practice a lot at the beginning of the year building a toolkit of okay I'm stuck now so what all right I can ask for more time I can ask to hear it in a different way I can ask the teacher to rephrase it I can ask you know we talk about what are the different things I can do to advocate for myself because I might not always be within these four walls when I encounter a problem and I need to have those intrinsic skills and so having that that vocabulary ready for your kids and then on the teachers part really trying to back away from good job that's right leave it to the class mathematicians what do you think this mathematician has proposed this idea thoughts you know and at the beginning they just stare at you like is it right or wrong you know but they start to learn and it's so powerful and it is so hard as a teacher though when somebody throws you know something wildly incorrect up there but the cool thing is there's a lot of grace in that too because when the kids start debating it discussing it we talk about do you have the right to change your mind and the kid will say oh I'd like to change my answer and I think there's so much power in how kids speak to each other and speak to themselves and then it's hard for the teacher but kind of backing up and just giving those launch points those launching questions right and then you're you're crowd control at that point I think just being mindful of like person praise versus process praise so if we say to a kid who does really well like oh you're so smart they equate doing well with being smart that it's some some inherent inborn thing that they have that they can do well and then when inevitably they hit a setback which they will and they don't do so well then all of a sudden it's like a question of like well if I'm not smart then who am I and so just being mindful of praising effort and the process that they took to learn like that was a really great strategy you use or I like how you solve that problem or if they breeze through something maybe that wasn't challenging enough let's try to find something else so being mindful of that being more robust with your feedback I think we like to use stickers and say good job a lot in the in the book I wrote we call it well I read it somewhere else that they call it Paula praise so like on American Idol and you think back to American Idol like the first with Simon and Paula and Randy always say good job and Simon was a lot meaner but he was much more specific and so you want to be be like that but definitely be specific and the the feedback that you're giving and I would rather have less feedback that's more specific than generalized praise that that is really meaningless so so you want to be be mindful of that and then yeah I just think thinking about that I used to say come on you can do this it's so easy and that was something I said as a teacher and I look back and think oh my gosh you know what that wasn't easy for that person is easy for me or I thought it was easy but it wasn't easy for that person and so what I was saying was actually not helping it was counterproductive and I thought I was being helpful and so just like really being mindful of what you're saying and how that that affects the student that you're working with is really important yeah I really love all those points yeah I guess just from a growth mindset standpoint I think the the kinds of language we use is the kinds of words we use can be really important and and there are so for example are you are you referring to things as for example we can talk about building skills like really calling out when you're doing something of why are you doing it oh you're you're building your skills you're becoming a mathematician or you're building you're building your writing skills right now or you're becoming a better writer or we're really really focusing students on those processes and kind of how the fact that they're learning while while they're doing so it's a kind of taking again you know taking the focus off of the end result and really focusing it on the thing that the students can actually control for themselves which is the process that they're doing and really reminding them and kind of debriefing with them so that they really understand what it is that they're doing and that all this effort they're doing it's not just going into a grade it's going to them leveling up right them becoming a writer then becoming a mathematician or a scientist or whatever that may be a great civic thinker whatever that may be they're really developing those skills and really making sure to call out that that learning is a process so they're enacting your class right so not just like work for sake of work but work for the sake of growth and betterment I love that all right so we're gonna wrap up I'm going to actually throw you a bit of a curveball and ask you a final question but with a challenge so what is one last piece of advice for teachers for fostering growth mindset that you would give this year if you can give it in ten words or less oh I know all right I'm gonna start with Dave have a growth mindset about building a growth mindset culture I think I did that right go ahead Annie I would say model your growth and fixed mindsets and normalize mistakes in your classroom okay be vulnerable be a champion for your kids and model I love that that was very good and all very tweetable very great so I want to thank Dave and Annie and Sam for joining us today I learned something and I hope that you all did too I want to remind everyone that there's still some time to sign up so if you haven't signed up please sign up like right now today but definitely by the end of October and if you keep on tagging your classroom celebrations with hashtag learnstorm on Twitter and Facebook we really love seeing in the office so please keep on doing that welcome back to the school year teachers thank you and goodbye you you
