On a cold winter day in Denver, the morning temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit. By noon it had fallen 9 degrees, and by 5 p.m. that afternoon it fell another 6 degrees. What was the temperature at 5 p.m.? So let's draw a number line here just to visualize what's going on. So this is 0, or since we're talking about temperature, we could say it's 0 degrees Fahrenheit. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So in the morning the temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit. That's right over here, 7 degrees, 7 degrees Fahrenheit. By noon it had fallen 9 degrees. So we're going to subtract 9 degrees from the 7 degrees. So it's going to be 7 minus 9. Let me do it this way. It had fallen 9 degrees. So we're going to subtract 9 degrees. And then by 5 p.m. it had fell another 6 degrees. So the expression for our temperature at 5 p.m. is the 7 degrees minus 9 minus another 6. On the number line, when you subtract something, you're really just moving to the left. So you start at 7. We're going to move 9 to the left. So one way to think about it is if you move 7 to the left, you're going to get back to 7. And then you're going to have to do two more to get to 9. So we're going to get to negative 2 degrees. So this will get us to negative 2 degrees. And you can verify that. We're moving 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to the left. We have moved 9 to the left. So the length of that arrow is 9. Obviously the length of this arrow right over here is 7. Another way to think about this is negative 2 degrees is you could say the length of the temperature, the absolute value of the temperature, it's going to be in the negative direction at noon, is going to be the difference of this orange arrow and this yellow arrow, the difference in their lengths. And so you could say that this would be the negative, because you know that you're subtracting a larger number from a smaller number. It's the negative of the larger of 9 minus 7. This will also give you negative 2 either way. So so far, this part right here evaluated to negative 2. And then we're going to subtract another 6. So it's going to be negative 2 minus 6. So we're going to move another 6 to the left. And so we're going to go negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7, negative 8. That is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now we don't want to always have to draw number lines and things like that. And just to think about it in a way that you wouldn't have to count like I just did. If I had negative 2 minus 6, you could say, look, I'm already starting 2 to the left of 0. And I'm going to go 6 more to the left of 0. So I'm definitely going to be the left of 0. And I'm going to be 8 to the left of 0. Start 2 to the left of 0. And I'm going to go 6 more to the left. Or you could view this as the negative of the absolute value of 2, which is 2, plus the absolute value of 6. And that's because we were already at the left and we moved even more in the negative direction. Can we do this? And this makes the computation maybe a little bit easier. Or maybe it doesn't. Whatever, I guess, floats your boat. Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful. So 7 minus 9 minus 6 is negative 8.
