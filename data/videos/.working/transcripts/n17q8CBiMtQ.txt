Let's do some more examples finding domains of functions. So let's add the function g of x. So this is our function definition here. It tells us, look, if we have an input x, the output g of x is going to be equal to one over the square root of six minus, let me write this a little bit neater one, over the square root of six minus the absolute value of x. So like always, pause this video and see if you can figure out what is the domain of this function based on this function definition? What is the domain of g? What is the set of all inputs for which this function is defined? All right, so to think about all of the inputs that would allow this function to be defined, it might be easy to just think, well, when does this function not get defined? Well, if we're divided by zero, then we're not going to be defined. Or if we have a negative under the radical. So if you think about it, if what we have under the radical is zero or negative, if it's zero or negative, if it's zero, you can take the principal root of zero, it's going to be zero, but then you're going to divide by zero and that's going to be undefined. And if what you have under the radical is negative, then the principal root isn't defined for a negative number, or at least the classic principal root isn't defined for a negative number. So if six minus the absolute value of x is zero or negative, this thing isn't going to be defined. Or another way to think about it is, it's going to be defined, so g is defined if six minus, and maybe I could write if and only if. Sometimes people write if and only if, two f's right there, if. If g is defined if and only if, this is kind of a math way of saying, if and only if six minus the absolute value of x is greater than zero. It has to be positive. If it's zero, we're going to take the square root of zero as zero and you're going to divide by zero, that's undefined, and if it's less than zero, then you're trying to find the principal root of a negative number, that's not defined. So let's see, g is defined if and only if, this is true, and let's see, we could add the absolute value of x to both sides. We could add the absolute value of x to both sides and then that would give us, six is greater than the absolute value of x, or that the absolute value of x is less than six. Or we could say that, in order, let me write it that way, the absolute value of x is less than six. Or another way of saying that is, x would have to be less than six and greater than negative six. Or x is between negative six and six. These two things, these two things are equivalent. If the magnitude of x is less than six, then x is greater than negative six and less than positive six. So if we wanted to write the domain in kind of fancy domain set notation, we could write the domain of g is going to be x, all the x's that are a member of real numbers, such that negative six is less than x, which is less than six. And we're done. Now let's do another one. And this one's gonna get even a little bit, a little bit hairier, just for kicks. All right, so let's say that I have, let's say that I have h of x is equal to, and I'm gonna have kind of a composite definition here. So let's say it's x plus 10 over x plus 10 times x minus nine times x minus five and it's this if, h of x is this if x does not equal five and it's equal to pi if x is equal, if x is equal to five. So once again, pause this video. Think about what is the domain of h? Or another way to think about it, when is h not defined? So let's think about it. So what would make h not defined? So if x is anything other than five, we go to this clause. If it's five, we go to this clause. So in this clause up here, what would make this thing undefined? Well the most obvious thing is if we divide by zero. So what's going to cause us to divide by zero? So if x is equal to, if, let me write it here. So we're gonna divide by zero. Divide by zero. That would happen if x is equal to nine. That would happen if x is equal to negative 10. x is equal to negative 10. Now we have to be careful. Would that happen if this was the only definition here? It would happen when x is equal to five. But remember when x equals five, we don't look at this part of the compound definition. We look at this part. So it's true that up here you would be dividing by zero if x is equal to five. But x is equal to five, you would never even look at it, look there. If our input is five, you use this part of the definition. So you would divide by zero, maybe I should write it this way, divide by zero on, I guess you could say, the top clause or the top part of definition. Part of the definition. If x equals nine, x equals negative 10, or, and that's it, because x equals five doesn't apply to this top part. If this clause wasn't here, then yes, you would write x equals five. Now we're almost done, but some of you might say, wait, wait, wait, but look, can't I simplify this? I have x plus 10 in the numerator, x plus 10 in the denominator, can't I just simplify this and then that'll disappear? And you could, except if you did that, you are now creating a different function definition. Because if you just simplify this, and you just said one over x minus nine, one over x minus nine times x minus five, this is now a different function. That one actually would be defined at x equals negative 10, but the one that we have started with, this one is not. This is, you're gonna end up with zero over zero, you're gonna end up with that indeterminate form. So for this function, exactly the way it's written, it's not going to be defined when x is equal to nine or x is equal to negative 10. So once again, if we wanna write it in our fancy domain set notation, the domain is going to be x, all the x's that are a member of the reals, such that x does not equal nine and x does not equal negative 10. Any other real number x, it's gonna work, including five. If x equals five, h of five is going to be equal to pi, because you default to this one over here. h of five, you say, okay, x equals five, we do that one right over there. Now if you gave x equals nine, you're gonna divide by zero, x equals negative 10, you're gonna divide by zero, but it's gonna work for anything else. So that right over there is the domain.
