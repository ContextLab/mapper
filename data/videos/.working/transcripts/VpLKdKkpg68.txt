I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Baker from Stanford Medical School and we're going to talk about what? How about Medicare Medicare? I? Think we knew that was going to happen because we had this picture here already. And so what is this a picture of I think? That's a picture of LBJ signing and signing the Medicare Act in 1965 This is the the time that we passed Medicare Lyndon Baines Johnson LBJ and this this is this looks like Truman right over here I think so and maybe he was there because he I think was probably old enough by that point to to be a recipient Yeah, 65 and over so what? You know I think we all have a general idea of what Medicare is that it's kind of a health care program or an insurance program for People who are retired, but then it starts to get fuzzy after that and there are all these details that confuse most of us Yeah, so we talked about Medicare in a bunch of different ways Medicare is a program. It's a US government program run by the federal government So it is run by the federal government. Yep, and sometimes it's thrown in with Medicaid. How are they different? It's at a very high level. Oh, so Medicaid is another a different insurance program run by the federal government in Coordination with state governments. It's Medicaid is a federal and state program Medicare is a federal program Medicare is for Folks who are 65 years old and older and people with disabilities principally those two groups Medicaid is a program That's aimed at lower income populations. And so this is this is older older people and Disabilities. Yeah, this is low income kind of kind of a poverty issue. Yes more so Income and this is primarily retirees The majority of the vast majority of people in there are folks who are there because they're over 65 Okay, and we're just gonna focus on Medicare and Medicare is federal government Medicaid is the federal and the state governments are in Medicaid because they're always They sound very similar. They sound very similar. Yeah I know they're easily confused at certainly at the name level really different programs. They operate completely separately In a few cases there are people who get access to both of them, but that they pay differently they run differently They're really the federal level. They are still run by the same organization the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare or Medicare the Department of Health and Human Services has a Subpart called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services if I see a branch. Oh, yeah, I mean the executive branch of our government obviously and then you have the Secretary of Health and Human Services of Health and Human Services Health and Human Services and then within that you have CMS which is the Centers for and you were saying earlier should have two M's in it Yeah, it's the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. So I think it's just shorter to have one Okay, okay these they administer at the federal level both Medicare and Medicaid Yeah, but just to reiterate Medicare is really mainly a federal thing while Medicaid is both So you have Medicare here, yeah Medicare and then you have Medicaid here. Yeah, I see. All right. All right. So let's dive deep into Medicare so is it I guess I guess what is it? Okay, so Medicare is an insurance program It provides insurance coverage for people who are eligible for it So if you're age 65 and over or if you have a permanent disability a couple other small groups if you have Lou Gehrig's disease or or End-stage renal disease kidney failure Then you can get access to Medicare too, but those are small populations So if you're in those groups, you're eligible for Medicare Medicare will provide you with insurance that will cover hospital bills doctor bills Some prescription drugs. It'll cover lots of the medical care and is it you know, I hear these things You know and this is the part that I think gets confusing for everyone is that you start hearing part a part B part C part D I don't know if those are all the parts What are those referring to and are they exactly insurance or are they something slightly different? Okay, so part so Medicare has these four parts part a part B part C and part D and you know It can get a little confusing but we could break it up into some different pieces so the biggest one in terms of the number of people who are in it is what sometimes we call traditional Medicare and that's What historically is part a and part B and they kind of want to take those two together because they make a package Okay, and we call that maybe traditional Medicare. Sometimes people call it original Medicare Standard Medicare, but okay, you know when they passed the program when they first did it part a was meant to cover hospital expenditures and part B Was aimed at doctor cost cost for seeing physicians Of course those things go so closely together that nowadays part a and part B are kind of a pair So you really rarely would find someone who only wanted part a or only one of right sometimes you hear those doctor crossroads outpatient Like it's a man But also sometimes you hear the word inpatient means you're you're living there while they're treating you outpatient You go visit them for an hour or two and leave and that's where you hear those Yeah, so that's a way of breaking up the kinds of services that medicine provides Medicare actually gets a little bit And it's mix and match so if Really a Medicare part a expenditure is when a hospital bills Medicare for use of the hospital use of the room Use of the services at the hospital any time a doctor bills Medicare Even if they saw the patient in the hospital, they're gonna be a part B. I see so it isn't it isn't strictly inpatient outpatient It really is much more along the lines of hospital and doctor. Yep. Okay. Well, I'll maybe put this in some type of Contain it away or something Necessarily it's not necessarily outpatient inpatient, but maybe one way of yeah, it's useful. It is useful to think about that outpatient inpatient so It will cover everything that happens. Are we including drugs or okay? So drugs is one key issue for the to the main question. The first thing I guess I'd say is that Medicare Traditional Medicare is pretty comprehensive. It covers, you know, most of the things that people would normally Encounter and their rights for healthcare does it cover everything or drugs is one big exception It does not cut so parts a and part B do not cover prescription drugs So when when Lyndon Johnson was signing this if Truman had to get prescribed some Drug and if he was a Medicare recipient he would in 1965 he would have to pay that out of pocket Yeah, so there so the I guess one caveat I'll note is that if you get prescription drugs that are administered to you while you're in the hospital I see you're staying in the hospital. They give you drugs that's gonna be generally covered under part A It's when you're outpatient and you're going home and there's somebody sends you the pharmacy to pick up a I see Medicare in its original form would not cover that they would not cover the part the outpatient prescription drugs So that became a problem for some folks and that has generated changes to the Medicare There have been there is a part now that covers that. Yeah, so that's the part D program as a Medicare extension I don't know how far we want to get a feel we can all right that right here. We'll just D for drugs Yeah Drugs has the whole story of prescription drugs and Medicare has you know kind of a lot too But people would buy additional policies if they had a and B right they buy themselves a private supplement that might cover drugs sometimes But now with the new part D plan, maybe people would buy that instead and then there's other stuff I was going on probably a C right there. It's a C that's coming and get that to a second But but so a and B traditional a hospitals be doctors and what what percent you know with my with my health insurance There's a copay every time I visit the doctor. It's you know $20 How does it work with traditional Medicare with parts a and part B? So if you just have part a and part B Then on the part B side doctors are covered 80% of the Medicare allowable charges So Medicare has a fee schedule that governs what doctors can be paid for services and Medicare will cover 80% of that and the patient pays 20 I see For part a it gets a little more complicated, but there's a Copayment that you have to make if you go to the hospital Medicare is gonna have a copay of a fixed amount several hundred dollars Coming up. It's just not as simple as 8020. It's not no not as simple as 8020. You're gonna pay a copay there, too So, you know They're not bad coverage But there's certainly some costs you can run up and if you're pretty sick you might really have a bill that's left There's extreme flexibility here. You can see any doctor you want go to any hospital you want. Yeah Medicare part a and part B is By to one way of thinking one of the last bastions of health care as it exists or health insurance as it existed in America in 1965 70 75 when there were really minimal restrictions on what doctors you could see what hospitals you could use and Doctors get lots of discretion here about the kinds of things they're gonna the services are gonna provide and there's not a lot of Oversight that you might see in today's hmo's right. But there are still I maybe I'm wrong here There's still are doctors that won't take Medicare patients. So doctors can elect to be Medicare Doctors or not and some doctors I think decide they have enough business I know patients from other places and you know Medicare is a plan It's got its rules and you have to follow the rules and some people think that Medicare doesn't pay as well as other options They have so there are a few most of the doctors the vast majority of doctors in the country will work with make But when you're saying it is kind of the super flexible thing if you do have an illness You can go see multiple doctors get second opinions You could go to the specialist on the other side of the country who so it is it is pretty good that way Although you have to pay, you know 20% of yes the doctors visit. So it's a pretty so what do what? Are there so what happens that you know, if I'm a retiree, I don't have a lot of money and you know I have a major bills. Yeah, I have a surgery $50,000. I know that's more of a hospital inpatient thing But let's say I have to you know, pay 10. What are their options so that they don't have to pay that out of pocket? Yeah, so there's a bunch of things that go into trying to figure out what the cost to getting this are and and how you Might get coverage for some of these other services. The main thing that would be the answer to the question is There are supplemental policies So if you're a retiree and you've gotten part a because you're eligible for that and you've paid your Medicare tax And you got part B which you do have to pay a little bit of money every month Small subsidized but still premium you have to pay you might decide in addition to that to pay for a supplemental insurance policy Which you'd buy from a private place, you know, the AARP is one place that sells these that are others other folks at some You pay an extra premium for that. That's an additional insurance plan that you have and that might agree and you might have a Method there to have them cover that I think I'll pay the additional hospitals in those plans There are some different varieties of those that cover more or less generously and of course charge a higher or lower premium for that I see that make complete sense and and and do people have to pay any premium to be in Medicare? To get a and B both you have to aid you generally don't If you pay your Medicare tax for 10 years working Work for 10 years here and you pay your Medicare tax you get part a for free Okay, but part B charges a premium so you do have to pay a small monthly. Well, it's like it's like on the order of like $100. Yeah, generally it's gone up a little bit over time Okay, something like that's not too much and you know, maybe a hundred or a little bit more per month, which is which is nothing I mean if you're if you're 65 or over and you try to get a private policy, you're probably looking at something like a thousand dollars a month Yeah So this so I guess two ways of thinking about it one This is heavily subsidized compared to what a person, you know 75 years old radio would pay for a actual private insurance policy would be much much higher than that You know there are people who look at that hundred a month and fixed income and social security and things and you say that's an issue and So one of the things that's just in the news the last few weeks is the fact that this number the number went up a bit Social security payments went up a little bit but less actually than the Medicare So I say, you know, I'm actually So there's some people who will still be worried about that even though it is heavily subsidized and looks like a great deal I see and then finally so we know a B and then we have a little bit of D We know it's about covering drugs. What does C do see is it exists? See? Yeah, see exists. See has been around for 20 or 30 years now. See is a separate choice. So when you turn 65 Let's say you can make this choice a little bit differently sometimes too But when you turn 65 you might decide to take part a and part B Maybe buy a traditional supplement maybe add the person part D drug plan on make yourself a package or you can elect part C And part C is an alternative Under part C what happens is the the CMS federal government has contracted with some hmos Kaiser Blue Cross other places Sometimes they've contracted with a few PPOs. They've tried other kinds of plans to mostly its hmos And so you have a choice then you can join Kaiser And have Kaiser be your your Medicare plan You can join the Blue Cross one depending on where you are You'll have different choices of different private plans that have contracted And you can do that the federal government will then pay a bunch of your premium to them I see so you'll get covered by the by the private plan with the federal government covering your cost They might ask you to pay some additional premium. You're gonna have to pay your part equivalent already So you got to pay that amount but then you might have to pay a little bit extra I see and then you'll get access to what services that has and so it's some for some people that's attractive because though the co-payments and Deductibles will be lower you'll often have more like the $10 copay, right? You might have access to some prescription drug coverage automatically built in there Or sometimes those cover some vision and other things right might be nice So this is so one or two plans I could get this whereas 80% coverage Well, I can't make that rule because hospitals it could be different But you get this kind of flexible thing, but you have a pretty significant copay the 20% patient I could get supplemental insurance for me to cover some of that right over there Or I can do parts is there a name for parts? You met is part see these days is called Medicare Advantage I saw the plans and parts the are called Medicare Advantage plans And so, you know, which is really just Medicare paying Subsidizing me to get private insurance Right from some plans that have agreed to work with Medicare patients and you know, they've agreed they do There's various checking up on them So they agree to make to basically cover everything that a and B would cover, you know So you're not going to get skimped on and what do most people do they go A and B? No traditional router they go to the C route So historically the vast majority of people have gone A and B route it changes kind of goes up and down over time I'm running on various factors But I you know over the over a historical average be something like 80 85 90 percent in a and maybe 2015 and B and C depending on which year you're looking at over the last 15 years Right and we could probably do a whole series of videos on it But what what is so when did D come about it wasn't part of the original D was not part of the original D comes about in the early 2000s Under George Bush George. Have you push? And what we heard about it was like 2003 I think I think that's probably about right and you know The issue there was there's a lot of a lot of folks who are having trouble getting their outpatient drugs covered in there So this is a plan. This is another part of Medicare. You can elect to buy this You normally would think about this if you've got A and B and you want to get outpatient drugs covered You think about a D plan part D is run by the federal government kind of the way that C is they they pay up They subsidize and they pay a premium to The private plans that cover drugs and then I see the person at least they organize the market and the person then pays also some Premium to guys a private private entity will handle the actual reimbursements for the drugs, but Medicare will pay them Yeah, so the you know the way to think about it is just a bunch of private entities with funds flows coming in You know partly from the person partly from Medicare. I buy these okay, so you and so you and you would pay Who do you pay your money to you pay to Medicare you pay to these these? Actually, yeah, I guess it works out the same way one way or the other But you're paying this is optional a retiree or someone over 65 would pay money to essentially get a drug plan Subsidized yes, okay. Yes cool cool You know there's some quite there's some interesting Participate in a drug plan I mean they are subsidized and the federal government is kicking a bunch of money in but it's a You know how exactly the economics of these plans works out is very interesting discussion right right? We could make a ton of videos. No, this is super helpful because I think you know frankly I didn't know about the differences right right here before about 15 minutes ago Well, thanks a bunch. Mm-hmm
