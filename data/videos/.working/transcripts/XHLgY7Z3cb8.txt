Let's see if we can write 3 fifths as a decimal. And I encourage you to pause this video and think about if you can do it on your own. And I'll give you a hint here. Can we rewrite this fraction? So instead of it being in terms of fifths, it can be in terms of tenths. So I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Let's try to rewrite this as a fraction with 10 as a denominator. But let's just first visualize this. So we have fifths. So let's say that's 1 fifth. Actually, let me just copy and paste this. So copy and paste. That is 2 fifths. That is 3 fifths. And that is 4 fifths. And that is 5 fifths. Or this would be a whole now. So that is our whole. And we want to color in three of those five. So we want to think about what 3 fifths are. So let me get my magenta out. So that's 1 fifth. I can actually make this bigger even. 2 fifths and 3 fifths. There you go. Color that in. That is 3 fifths. Now, how could I write this in terms of tenths? Instead of 3 fifths, a certain number of tenths. Well, let's split this whole into tenths. And the easiest way to split this whole into tenths is to take each of those fifths and turn them into 2 tenths. So let's do that. So if we were to do this right over here, we now have twice as many sections. So another way of thinking about it, we are multiplying the number of sections by 2. We now have 10 sections. Each of these is a tenth. And the three of those sections are not going to be twice as many. What we have in magenta, we now have twice as many sections in magenta. So we're going to multiply that by 2 as well. Notice, we just multiplied the numerator and the denominator by 2. But hopefully it makes conceptual sense. Every piece, when we're talking about fifths, we've now doubled so that instead of every 1 fifth is now 2 tenths. You have a 1 tenth now and a 1 tenth now. And we could just keep writing 1 tenths if we like. Each of these things right over here are a tenth. And then each of the three are now twice as many tenths. So the 3 fifths is now 6 tenths. So let's write that down. So this is going to be equal to 6 over 10. Now why is this interesting? You can literally view this as 6 tenths. So you could literally view this as 6 times 1 tenth. I'm going to do that in blue. 6 times 1 tenth. Well, what's another way to represent 6 tenths, or 6 times 1 tenth? Well, you can express that as a decimal, where we go to the tenths place. So let's see, 0 point, the space, the place, right to the right of the decimal, that is the tenths place. This right over here is the ones. That right over here is the tenths. That's the tenths place. So how many tenths do we have? We have 6 tenths. So we could write this as 0.6. So there you have it. This is equal to 0.6. And we're done. We've just expressed this as a decimal. 6 tenths is the same thing as 6 tenths, which can be rewritten as 3 fifths or vice versa.
