Let's see if we could figure out what x plus 7, let me write that a little bit neater, x plus 7 squared is. And I encourage you to pause the video and work through it on your own. All right, now let's work through this together. So we just have to remember, we're squaring the entire binomial. So this thing is going to be the same thing as x plus 7 times x plus 7. I'm going to write the second x plus 7 in a different color, which is going to be helpful when things out. When we see it like this, then we can multiply these out the way we would multiply any binomials. And I'll first do it the, I guess you could say, the slower way, but the more intuitive way, applying the distributive property twice. And then we'll think about maybe some shortcuts or some patterns we might be able to recognize, especially when we are squaring binomials. So let's start with just applying the distributive property twice. So let's distribute this yellow x plus 7 over this magenta x plus 7. So we can multiply it by the x, this magenta x. So it's going to be x. Let me do it in that same color. So it's going to be magenta x times x plus 7 plus magenta 7 times yellow x plus 7. x plus 7. And now we can apply the distributive property again. We can take this magenta x and distribute it over the x plus 7. x times x is x squared. x times 7 is 7x. And then we can do it again over here. This 7, let me do it a different color. So this 7 times that x is going to be plus another 7x. And then the 7 times the 7 is going to be 49. And we're in the home stretch. We can then simplify it. This is going to be x squared. And then these two middle terms, we can add together. 7x plus 7x. That's going to be 14x plus 14x plus 49. And we're done. Now the key question is, do we see some patterns here? Do we see some patterns that we can generalize? And that might help us square binomials a little bit faster in the future. Well, when we first looked at just multiplying binomials, we saw a pattern like x plus a times x plus b is going to be equal to x squared. Let me write it this way. It's going to be equal to x squared plus a plus b x plus b squared. And so if both a and b are the same thing, we could say that x plus a times x plus a is going to be equal to x squared. And this is the case when we have a coefficient of 1 on both of these x's. x squareds. Now in this case, a and b are both a. So it's going to be a plus a times x. Or we could just say plus 2ax. Let me be clear what I just did. Instead of writing a plus b, I could just view this plus a times x and then plus a squared. Or that's the same thing as x squared plus 2ax plus a squared. This is a general way of expressing a squared binomial like this. A squared binomial where the coefficients on both x's are 1. And we could see that's exactly what we saw over here. And this, in the example we did, 7 is our a. So we got x squared right over there. Let me circle it. So we have this blue x squared. That corresponds to that over there. And then 7 is our a. So 2ax, 2 times 7 is 14x. Notice we have the 14x right over there. So this 14x corresponds to 2ax. And then finally, if a is 7, a squared is 49. a squared is 49. So in general, if you're squaring a binomial, a fast way to do it is to do this pattern here. And we could do another example real fast just to make sure that we've understood things. If I were to tell you what is x minus a negative in here, x minus 3 squared. I encourage you to pause the video and think about expressing this using this pattern. Well, this is going to be, in this case our a, we have to be careful, our a is going to be negative 3. So that is our a right over there. So this is going to be equal to x squared. Now 2ax, let me do it in the same color actually just for fun. So it's going to be x squared. Now what is 2 times a times x? a is negative 3. So 2 times a is negative 6. So it's going to be negative 6x. So minus 6x. That's 2 times a is the coefficient. And then we have our x there. And then plus a squared. What is negative 3 times negative 3? It's going to be positive 9. And just like that, when we looked at this pattern, we were able to very quickly figure out what this binomial squared actually is. And I encourage you, you can do it again with applying the distributive property twice to verify that this is indeed the same thing as x minus 3 squared.
