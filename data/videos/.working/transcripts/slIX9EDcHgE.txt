Let's try now to subtract some two digit numbers. So over here we have 65 minus 23, and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you could figure this out. So I'm assuming you've had a try at it, so let's do it together. So the way I like to do it is I start in the ones place, and the numbers in the ones place, I've colored them in in yellow. So this right over here is the ones place, and this over here in purple is the tens place. And I could even do a column here where everything in yellow, this is the ones column, I guess you could think of it that way, everything there is in the ones place. They're representing a certain number of ones, and then everything in the second column, everything in the second column is in the tens place. They represent a certain number of tens. 65 is six tens and five ones. 23 is two tens and three ones. So one way to do it is say let's look at the ones place first. So I'm taking three ones away from five ones. Five ones minus three ones is two ones. And then you can go to the tens place. Six tens minus two tens, well, that's going to be four tens. Four tens, and there you have it. This is equal to 42. And once again, I could have written it multiple ways. I could have written it like this. I could have written 65 as six tens, six tens plus five ones, plus five ones. I didn't write over here because when I have something in this place, that means it's tens. But here I can write it out, six tens. And then if I'm subtracting 23, that's the same thing as subtracting two tens, subtracting two tens, and then subtracting three ones. And then subtracting, let me get that, subtracting three ones. Subtracting three ones. And so what's that going to be? Well, five ones minus three ones is exactly what we have over here. It's going to be two ones. And six tens minus two tens, well, that's just going to be four tens. Four tens. So six tens plus five ones minus two tens minus three ones is going to be four tens and two ones. Four tens and two ones are 42. 42 is equal to four tens plus two ones. Hopefully that makes a little bit of sense.
