So Natalie, what do you do here at Khan Academy? At Khan Academy, I am our content localization program manager, which means I work on everything that allows our content to be more available and accessible to more people in more places. So what does localization mean? Localization is a nice fancy way of saying making the experience feel right for you. So if you're in the States, for example, you might speak English and so it makes sense for you to hit the Khan Academy site in English or with content that makes sense for your use case. For example, if you're in school and it makes sense for you to have maybe common core aligned curriculum. But if you're, say, not living in the United States, then you might not need common core curriculum. You might need something that's more aligned to, say, your standards, like if you're in India, maybe the NCRT standards or in Hindi, for example. So that's one way to think about localization, just making the experience right for you. And how on a day to day basis do you work towards that goal? Sure. I kind of segment the way that I think about my job in sort of two ways. One being internal, what can we do to make that experience really better? And externally, who do we need to work with to make that happen? So on an internal side of things, I work with both product people, engineers, designers, developers, et cetera, to create the infrastructure on a product side to even make our content localizable. So that's... What does that mean, the infrastructure on the product side? Sure. So that means we have tons of strings of words on our website. And like a string in computers is just like a collection of letters. Imagine a sentence that I am saying right now, that sentence needs to be translated. And so being able to sort of extract that sentence and put it somewhere so that people can translate it and then take it back and put it on the website in a different form is one way you're thinking about making the product localizable. And so that means making sure we have the infrastructure in place to be able to do that. So that's the sort of internal side, making sure that we're set up for success there. And the external side, it's really working with the people who can make translations happen from volunteers to partner organizations and to see who we can work with maybe not inside of Khan Academy to help spread the word or get us to our goal of reaching more people and more places faster. Who are these volunteers and these partner organizations? So the volunteers are people from all over the world who have found Khan Academy and decided they want to volunteer their time to translate our content. Some of these people are, we receive applications from kids in high school who are using Khan Academy right now in English perhaps and say, I really want to have this in Swedish or in German. And they also could be teachers who have had the ability to use the product so far and say, wow, this could be X percent better if my kids could use it in their native language. From the organization side, these are philanthropic organizations like the Lemon Foundation in Brazil who work with us to not only translate our content, they have a whole program of translators on their side of things, but also who can work with schools and do trainings with teachers in their local context. They really understand what's happening on the ground in a way that our small 80-person team just can't write down. So they also help to work with localization in a different way. I see. And what language is this Khan Academy available in now? Right now we have full platform experiences. So that means videos and exercises and all of the strings on the platform, coach resources, etc. in Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, and French with many more on the way. So we've got Turkish, we've got German, we've got Hindi, tons of translation projects and over 40 languages right now. And so we start talking a little bit about your day-to-day. So explain, what's going to go on today? Sure. Or tomorrow? Yeah, well they're probably going to be different answers. So today's Monday and usually when I come in on Monday I sort of think about, okay, what do I have to tackle this week? What are my, as we call them at Khan Academy, big rocks? These are the things that are really going to sort of move the mountain of rocks to actually make a difference. And so I evaluate at the onset of the week, what are those big rocks and how am I going to make sure I have the time budgeted within the week to do that? Things come up all the time, right? But to-do list is pretty long and so carving out that time is really important. Sometimes that means to sort of go back to the internal external side of things, working more internally with setting up new projects that our product team can get started on. And sometimes that means, you know, having several calls or meetings a week with our external partners to make sure we're aligned on what our big goals are. So it varies day-to-day. Sometimes lots of alone work, sometimes lots of teamwork, sometimes lots of a-boo. And what were you doing before coming to Khan Academy? Before coming to Khan Academy I was on a Fulbright in Turkey where I was teaching English at a university. And it's actually one of the reasons I ended up coming to Khan Academy because I noticed, as most people do when they teach English in an abroad context, that my students weren't able to get over the hurdle of just the language barrier, let alone mastering concepts and skills and really being able to think about cool things that language can provide you with the opportunity to do. And so I noticed that firsthand in my work experience, but also I noticed when I was living abroad that I was aching for, you know, new learning experiences and wanting to push myself further and further. So I actually used Khan Academy when I was abroad just to like relearn math and re-lubricate my brain because I actually, I love learning and was really inspired by the product. So that's why I ended up after my Fulbright coming here. And what's it been like? What's been surprising? Hmm, what's been surprising? I think when I think about the opportunity that we have here at Khan Academy to reach millions, if not a billion people at some point who haven't yet had the opportunity to be impacted by what we're doing here, that kind of blows my mind, right? So maybe it's less a surprise than something that gets me up every day and coming to work that if there's one small thing that I do that can impact even one person, that's a super cool opportunity and a super awesome thing to work towards. So that's certainly been exciting for me. Other surprises, everyone here is a giant goofball, right? I think sometimes we think of the work environment as being very strict and, you know, we come in, we have lots of to-do things and got to get those big rocks out of the way. But like one of my favorite things about working here is going around and like giving people high fives and having push-up contests at random parts of the day just to get the energy flowing. So I think that's... Tell me about those since I did the Dominate. Dominate? Interesting. I'll invite you next time. And what are you excited about right now? And our work? Yes. Or anything actually. So with regards to the Work Here at Khan Academy, we are, you know, several years into the let's get our content translated idea, but now we're really able to focus now that we've set the foundation here in the U.S. for who we are and what we're doing. And we've seen the great product market fit here in the United States. I think we're really set up to make a big impact in lives for people who don't live here and maybe don't speak English. So that's naturally what excites me the most about my current thing going on here. Other things going on in my life that I'm excited about, I don't know if that's what you're asking. I just started becoming... I just trained to be a yoga teacher. Oh wow, that's exciting. So now I teach yoga. Maybe I'll bring that to the company. And let's see, yeah, I don't know what else. Just, I'm really inspired to work here and it takes up a lot of good brain space for me. Well now, thank you. And you said it gets you up in the morning just to help one person. I do suspect that the work you're doing will impact several tens of millions if not hundreds of millions. Hopefully. Hopefully, yes. So thank you. No problem.
