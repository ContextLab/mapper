        "A": "The neuron sums the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials over time and across inputs; if the net depolarization at the axon hillock reaches threshold, an action potential is triggered; otherwise it is not.",

        "C": "Inhibitory inputs always cancel excitatory inputs completely, preventing any action potential.",
