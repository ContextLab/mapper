Hi, I'm Michelle, a professional learning specialist here at Khan Academy and a former classroom teacher just like you. Meet Khanmigo, your AI-driven companion who's revolutionizing teaching for a more engaging and efficient experience. Khanmigo has many exciting features that support teachers, and this video will showcase ways that you can use Khanmigo to create course-specific content to enhance the learning experience for all of your students. Throughout this video, we'll explore ways Khanmigo can assist you with creating unique and engaging lesson plans and student-centered activities that get students excited about learning while saving you time. Ready to see the teaching assistant you've always wanted? Let's take a look. This is Khanmigo's dashboard. It's filled with a plethora of unique and helpful features designed to enhance your teaching experience and save you time. Let's begin with the lesson hook feature. Igniting a passion for mathematics can be challenging, but it's profoundly impactful and a definite game changer when accomplished. Empowered by Khanmigo, I'll be able to design captivating math lesson introductions that ignite students' curiosity and spark a thirst for knowledge in math. Once I select the button, I just have to let Khanmigo know the grade level. This is for my seventh grade class. And I let Khanmigo know the topic. We are working on two-step inequalities. And with just one click, Khanmigo will create three engaging lesson hooks that will be sure to capture my students' attention. With my students' curiosity now ignited, it's time to craft my lesson. Khanmigo's lesson plan tool will help me design a customized plan aligning with my curriculum and my students' needs. Once I enter the lesson plan feature, Khanmigo asks me to detail the topic I intend to teach. It then presents a selection of topics from Khan Academy's rich course offerings. If my topic isn't listed, Khanmigo allows me to incorporate my own. I'm going to select this lesson. Once I make my selection, Khanmigo swiftly generates a structured detailed lesson plan tailored to my curriculum and my students. The plan includes learning objectives, warm-up activities, exit ticket questions, direct instruction, independent practice, and so, so, so much more. And one of my favorite parts is that this lesson plan is fully customizable. I can effortlessly modify any part to better fit the needs of my students. I don't think my students will do well with this warm-up, so I'm going to change it. Again, with one click of the button, Khanmigo appears and I can ask Khanmigo to make changes to it, or I can just ask Khanmigo to try something different, or I can discuss it with Khanmigo. I'm not really sure what I want to change it to, so I'm just going to ask Khanmigo to please try something different. And again, with one click, Khanmigo will create a different warm-up. After my lesson plan is complete, I'm able to print it, or I can export my lesson plan to a Word document, a PDF, or save it to my Google Drive. This has saved me so much time. Thanks so much, Khanmigo. As an educator, I understand the value of exposing students to grade-level text and vocabulary. However, balancing this with comprehension is crucial. My upcoming unit on the play Julia Caesar often presents a comprehension challenge for high school students, especially in understanding Shakespearean language. Grasping Brutus' speech in Act 2 is crucial to the play, and I want to make sure that my students understand. Once I let Khanmigo know the title of the text, I just copy and paste the original text in the space provided and let Khanmigo know the grade level that I'd like it leveled to. Once I let Khanmigo know the title of the text, I just copy and paste the original text in the space provided, and then I just let Khanmigo know the grade level that I'd like the text re-leveled for. I would like this on a seventh grade level, please. And again, with just one click, all of my students will be able to understand Brutus' speech. Thanks again, Khanmigo. Refresh My Knowledge is another super cool feature with Khanmigo. It's like a friendly nudge to help you review topics that you've learned before, but you may be a little bit rusty on. That's why I plan to use it before I begin my unit on the First Amendment. First, Khanmigo wants to know the topic and what grade level I'd like a refresher on. We're about to work on the First Amendment, and this is for my 10th grade history class. Once I provide that information, Khanmigo gives me the option of quizzing me on the topic or learning through conversation. When I select learning through conversation, Khanmigo gives me five major concepts at this grade level to select from, which helps me review and prepare for my lesson. Now that my memory has been sufficiently refreshed, I want to bridge the lesson with real-life scenarios to enhance my students' engagement with the topic. Khanmigo's real-world context generator will do that for me in a matter of seconds, boosting my students' interest and investment in the topic. I just have to let Khanmigo know the grade level and the topic. And with just one click, Khanmigo creates three creative ideas on how I can bring the First Amendment to life for my students. Everything Khanmigo creates is completely customizable, so I can apply it to topics that interest my students. I would like to change this to something about sports. My students are absolutely going to love this. Thanks, Khanmigo. The next feature I'm going to explore is the informational text generator. This feature will create an informational text passage for the grade level that I want from first grade all the way through the collegiate level. Once you input the intended grade level and topic of your choice, you're able to select the length of the passage you'd like to create. And whether you select 100 words, 300 words, or 750 words, Khanmigo will do the rest. This is also an excellent feature for integrating cross-curricular content because it provides students with multiple ways to engage with the material. As an educator, I aim to craft thought-provoking discussion prompts tailored to specific topics for my students. My goal is to ignite their curiosity and stimulate intellectual discourse, so I'm going to use the discussion prompt feature. I let Khanmigo know the grade level and topic. Photosynthesis in organisms. And in a matter of seconds, Khanmigo creates multiple detailed and thought-provoking discussion questions that'll be sure to get my students chatting, but in a good way. If you're looking for a fun, engaging way to learn for your students, you have to try our fun class summary poem feature. It's a unique, rhythmic way to summarize lessons for your students. Let's give it a try. When I select a button, Khanmigo wants me to ask my class what they learned today. Today in my peer counseling class, we talked about goal setting. And then you want to ask them for a fun word that will inspire your poem. They all scream out, summer. Now Khanmigo will do the rest. And here's our poem. In the heart of summer, under the sun's beaming ray, we set our goals, not astray. Like ice cream melting, time will fleet, but our ambitions, the heat can't beat. We'll reach our dreams, come what may, just like the sun at the end of the day. I love it. It's not just a poem. It's a memory booster, a creativity enhancer, and a super cool learning tool. Thanks so much, Khanmigo.
