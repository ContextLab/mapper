Hello grammarians, today I'd like to introduce you to the verb, which is another part of speech. But I suppose the most fruitful place for us to begin is by asking, what is a verb? A verb is a part of speech that has a bunch of different functions, but one of its most important functions is that it can express or show action. Verbs can show action. Action. In order to demonstrate this, I have brought along a little cartoon bear, and I'm going to use this bear in several sentences, each of which will contain a verb, because all sentences contain verbs. So I'm gonna write a couple of sentences about the bear, and every time I use a verb, I'm gonna write it in yellow like that. Here we go. The bear roars. The bear runs. The bear sleeps. Now each one of these words in yellow is a verb. Each one of them is an action, and this is the first thing that verbs can do. Verbs can show action in sentences. And in fact, all sentences are a verb. So I'm gonna write a couple of sentences that I'm gonna write in yellow, and I'm gonna write a couple of sentences. And in fact, all sentences must contain verbs. You can learn anything. David out.
