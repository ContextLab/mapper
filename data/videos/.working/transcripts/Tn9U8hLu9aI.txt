perform a sequence of transformations to try to map the movable figure, that's this figure right over here, onto CORAL, or CORAL, so CORAL is this polygon right over here. And then we have to figure out are these two figures congruent? So they're congruent if through some combination of translations, rotations, and reflections, I can make this figure sit right on top of figure CORAL. So let's use this tool right over here to do that, to do some translations, rotations, and reflections. And so the first thing I want to do, let me translate it so they get close to each other, and maybe I can get a one, let me see if I can get one point in common. So just like that, I've been able to get this point in common, and it seems like if these are going to be congruent, that those would correspond to each other. And now it looks pretty clear that these are reflections of each other, so let me reflect them along, so it looks like if I were to put my point right there, and let's see, if I reflect right along, go right in between, it looks like if I reflect right along that, I might end up being done, and I am done. So just with that literal translation followed by reflection, I was able to make these two figures sit on top of each other. So these are definitely congruent.
