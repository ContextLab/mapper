A club of nine people wants to choose a board of three officers. A president, a vice president, and a secretary. How many ways are there to choose the board from the nine people? Now, we're going to assume that one person can't hold more than one office. That if I'm picked for president, that I'm no longer a valid person for vice president or secretary. So let's just think about the three different positions. So you have the president. You have the president. You have the vice president, VP. And then you have the secretary. Now, let's say that we go for the president first. It actually doesn't matter. Let's say we're picking the president slot first and we haven't appointed any of their slots yet. How many possibilities are there for president? Well, the club has nine people, so there's nine possibilities for president. Now, we're going to pick one of those nine. We're going to kind of take them out of the running for the other two offices, right, because someone's going to be president. So one of the nine is going to be president. There's nine possibilities, but one of the nine is going to be president. So you take that person aside. He or she is now the president. How many people are left to be vice president? Well, now there's only eight possible candidates for vice president. Eight possibilities. Now, he or she also goes aside. Now, how many people are left for secretary? Well, now there's only seven possibilities for secretary. So if you want to think about all of the different ways there are to choose a board from the nine people, there's the nine for president, times the eight for vice president, times the seven for secretary. You didn't have to do it this way. You could have picked secretary first and there would have been nine choices, and then you could have picked vice president and there would have still been eight choices, and then you could have picked president last and there would have only been seven choices, but either way you would have got nine times eight times seven. And that is, let's see, nine times eight. Nine times eight is 72. 72 times seven is two times seven is 14. Seven times seven is 49. Plus one is 50. So 504. 504 possible ways to pick your board out of a club of only nine people.
