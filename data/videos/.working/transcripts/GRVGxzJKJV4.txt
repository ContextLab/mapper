We're told the list below shows three clues about a number and they say which of these numbers could be the number described So why don't you pause this video and try to do this before we do this together? Okay, now let's do this together. So the first clue is the number is greater than forty three thousand two hundred and fifteen So let's see which of these numbers are greater than forty three thousand two hundred fifteen So they all have four ten thousands. So that doesn't help us much But if we go to the thousands place this one only has two thousands, so it's not greater This is forty two thousand and something so it's definitely less than forty three thousand and something so we can rule this one out Just phrase on that first clue now these second two. This is forty five thousand and something is forty six thousand and something So it's definitely larger than forty three thousand and something. So we've used that first clue We're gonna have it down now to two numbers. The second clue the number is less than forty seven thousand eight hundred ninety Well both of these this is forty five thousand in something This is forty six thousand and something so they're both less than forty seven thousand and something So this isn't really helping us that much Now let's look at this last clue. The number has a six in the hundreds place So the hundreds place this is one tens hundreds six in the hundreds place. I like choice B Ones tens hundreds. This does not have a six in the hundreds place. We rule that one out and B is our answer
