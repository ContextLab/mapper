So what I have right over here is the equation of a function in vertex form. What I wanna do is rewrite it so it is in standard form. So pause this video and have a go at that before we do it together. All right, let's just remind ourselves what standard form looks like. Standard form would be a function f of x in the form some constant a times our second degree term plus another constant b times our first degree term plus another constant c. So how do we put this thing into this form? Well, we essentially will expand things out. So we could start with x minus five squared. So we're gonna multiply x minus five times x minus five. Then we're gonna take that, multiply it by negative two and then add seven. So first of all, what is x minus five times x minus five? Some of y'all might already have a lot of practice doing this by taking the square of binomials but I'll give a little bit of review. We have x times x here, which is going to be x squared. And then you have negative five times x which would be in minus five x. I could write that out, minus five x. And then you have another negative five times, you have another negative five times this x which is going to be another minus five x. And then you're going to have a negative five times a negative five is plus 25. Or we could write this as x squared minus 10x plus 25. And so that's what I have boxed off here. Let me put that in parentheses. And then I'm going to multiply that by negative two. And then I'm going to add seven. So all of this is going to be equal to f of x. So what's this going to be equal to? Well, let's take our negative two and distribute it onto each of these terms. So negative two times x squared. And we have to be very careful here. Make sure we get our signs right. Is negative two x squared. Negative two times negative 10x. Negative times negative is a positive. Positive 20x. And then negative two times positive 25 is negative 50 or we're going to subtract 50 there. And then last but not least, we want to add seven. And so all of this f of x is going to be equal to negative two x squared plus 20x. And then if I take minus 50 or negative 50 plus seven, it's negative 43 or seven minus 50 is negative 43. And we're done. We have rewritten the function in standard form.
