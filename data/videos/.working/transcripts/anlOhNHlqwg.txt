Blair scored 144 points this football season. He scored all his points with 50 yard field goal. That's actually pretty impressive. That's like close to record breaking and even in the National Football League. I think the record is like 60 yards or something. So that's, Blair seems like a fairly impressive individual. He scored all his points with 50 yard field goal kicks. 50 yard, well, 50 yard field goal kicks. I'm just underlying that because I'm impressed with what those field goals are, which are each worth 3 points. So a field goal in American football, I should clarify for those of you from other countries who think we're talking about soccer, a field goal is worth 3 points each. He played, he played in 16 games this season. How many field goals did Blair make in each game? Assume he made the same number in each game. So this guy is incredibly, is an incredibly consistent field goal kicker. He makes 50 yard field goals. He makes the same in every game. So let's think about how many field goals did he make in each game. So there's a couple of ways you can do this. We could first figure out, well, how many field goals did he make in the season? So he scored 144 points. He scored 144 points total. And if we divide that by 3, we divide that by the fact that a field goal gets you 3 points per field goal. So the total number of points divided by the points per field goal, this should give us the total number of field goals he had. So this right over here is going to be equal to, so 3 goes into 144. Let me do this on the side right over here. 3 goes into 144. 3 goes into, doesn't go into 1. It goes into 14 4 times. 4 times 3 is 12. Subtract. 14 minus 12 is 2. Bring down a 4. 3 goes into 24 perfectly. It goes exactly 8 times. 8 times 3 is 24. We have no remainder. So 144 divided by 3 is equal to 48. So all season he has kicked 48 field goals. Field, field goals. Now, we still haven't answered the question. How many did he make in each game? And we're assuming it's the same number in each game. So the total number across 16 games, to find out the average he makes in each game, we divide this by 16. So let's take 48 total field goals divided by 16 games. Is going to be, well 48 divided by 16 is 3. This is equal to 3 field goals per field goals. He scored 4 per game. And we're done. How many field goals did he score, make in each game? He scored 3.
