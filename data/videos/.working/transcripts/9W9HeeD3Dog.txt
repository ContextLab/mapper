out what seven minus four and five eighths is equal to. And pause this video and try this on your own before we do this together. All right, now let's do this together. Now there's different ways that you could approach this, but one way we could think about lining up the whole numbers. So we have seven, and then from that, we're going to subtract four wholes and five eighths. Now we have an issue here because this top number here doesn't have any eighths. So where do we subtract that five eighths from? Well, one thing that we could do is we can rewrite seven. Seven is the same thing as six plus one. Why did I write it this way? Because I can re-express one as a certain number of eighths. One is the same thing as what? Well, one is the same thing as eight eighths. So seven is the same thing as six plus eight over eight. Why is this useful? Well, I could write this, and it's a little unusual to write it this way, but I could write this as six and eight eighths. I know that's a very strange looking mixed number, but if we were to write it here, it would actually make this subtraction pretty straightforward. If we rewrote the seven, now let me change the color to make it clear what I'm writing. So if we were to rewrite this seven as six and eight eighths, and from that, we are subtracting four and five eighths. The reason why this whole exercise was useful is now we could even think of this as the eighth place, if you wanted to think of it that way, but now we have enough eighths here to subtract five eighths from it. Eight eighths minus five eighths, this part right over here, is going to be equal to three eighths. And then we could focus on the holes. So six holes minus four holes is going to be two holes. And we're done, two and three eighths. As I said, there's other ways that you could have expressed this. You could have converted this second, you could have converted both of them into pure fractions instead of mixed numbers, but this is actually the way that my head would probably handle it, especially if I'm trying to do it in everyday life.
