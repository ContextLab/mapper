Hey Paige. What's up, David? Is this right? Okay, so I'm about to go to the grocery store and it looks like it says, I need to get squid pickles and chocolate at the grocery store. Yeah. Did you want squid pickles? No, I wanted squid and pickles. I must have written it down wrong. Okay, so I think what we need to do in order to fix this list and avoid confusion like this in the future is using commas to punctuate a list. Because right now this just looks like squid pickles. I mean, probably delicious, pickled squid. Probably delicious, but not what we were looking to get today. Right. So, okay, so if we don't want to get pickled squid today, then we have to put commas in between the elements of the list, right? Because this is what commas do, they separate elements of everything. So, let's put in those dividers. I need to get squid, comma, pickles, comma, and chocolate at the grocery store. Exactly. Okay, so we can punctuate a list by separating out nouns. And I see from this second sentence here, Paige, could you give me a read for that? I'm gonna go for a run, read a chapter of my book, and go see the new Colonel Justice movie. Oh, I hear, that's good. So, right now it says that, but it could also just be I'm going to go for a run read, a chapter of my book, and go see the, you know, like there's no... It's a little confusing. It's a little confusing. Like, there could be such a thing as a run read. There probably is. You know, like where you go for a jog while holding a book. Sounds difficult. And so we can also use commas in lists to separate not just nouns, like in this first one, but also verb phrases. So I'm going to go for a run, comma, read a chapter of my book, comma, and go see the new Colonel Justice movie. Perfect. Cool. So that's how you punctuate a list with commas. Yeah, you got it. You can learn anything. David out. Paige out.
