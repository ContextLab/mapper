So we're told that h of x is equal to the negative cube root of three x minus six plus 12. And what we want to figure out is what is the inverse of h? So what is, what is h inverse of x going to be equal to? And like always, pause the video and see if you can figure it out. Well, in previous videos, we've emphasized that what an inverse does is it, well, a function will map from a domain to a range, and you can think of the inverse as mapping back from that point in the range to where you started from. So one way to think about it is we want to come up with an expression that unwinds whatever this does. So if we say that y, if we say that y is equal to h of x, well, we could say that y is equal to the negative of the cube root of three x minus six plus 12. This gives us our y, and you could think of y as a member of the range, a member of the range in terms of what our input is, in terms of a member of the domain. But we want to go the other way around. So what we could do is we could try to solve for x. If we solve for x, we're going to have some expression that's a function of y, we're going to have that being equal to x, and so that would be the inverse mapping. Another way you could do that is that you could just swap x and y and then solve for y, but that's a little bit less intuitive that this is actually the inverse. So actually, let's just solve for x here. So the first thing that we might want to do is let's isolate this cube root on, let's say the right-hand side. So let's subtract 12 from both sides, and we would get y minus 12 is equal to the cube root of, it's actually the negative cube root, don't want to lose track of that, negative cube root of three x minus six, and then we subtracted 12 from both sides, so that 12 is now, that 12 is now gone. And now, what we could do, well, we could multiply both sides by a negative one, that might just get rid of this negative here. So we multiply both sides by a negative one, negative one, and then we multiply this times a negative one. On the left-hand side, well, that's the same thing as 12 minus y, and on the right-hand side, we're gonna get the cube root of three x minus six. And now, and this is gonna be a little bit algebraically hairy, we want a cube of both sides. So let's do that. So let's cube both sides, and actually, that doesn't get that algebraically hairy, because I don't actually have to figure out what this, I don't have to expand it, I could just leave it as 12 minus y cubed. And so if we cube both sides, on the left-hand side, we're just left with 12 minus y cubed, and on the right-hand side, well, you take the cube of the cube root, you're just gonna be left with what you originally had under the cube root sign, I guess you could say. And now, we want to solve for x, let's add six to both sides. So we're gonna get 12 minus y cubed plus six is equal to three x. Now, we could divide both sides by three, and we're all done. Divide both sides by three, and we get, we get x is equal to 12 minus y to the third power, plus six over three. And so this, if you have a member of the, one way to think about it, if you have a member of the range y, this is going to map it back to the x that would have gotten you to that member of the range. So this is the inverse function. So we could write h inverse of y is equal to this business, 12 minus y cubed plus six over three. And like we said in previous videos, this choice of just calling y the input, well, it could be anything. We could call that star. We could say h inverse of star, and we're just naming our input star is equal to 12 minus star cubed plus six over three. Or if we just wanna call the input x, we could just say h inverse of x. And once again, this is just, this is just what we're calling the input, is equal to 12 minus x to the third plus six over three. Might be a little bit confusing, because now in theory, x could be considered a member of the range, and we're mapping back to a member of the domain. But either way, we can call the input function to a function, practically anything. But there you have it. That is our inverse function that essentially unwinds what our original function does.
