Find the opposite of 2x squared minus 7x plus 13. So in this context, when they're talking about opposite, they're really just talking about the negative of the expression. So if I told you find the opposite of 1 in this context, I'd say, well, you know, that would be the negative of it. It would be negative 1. If I said find the opposite of 17, it would be the negative of that. It would be negative 17. If I told you find the opposite of negative 3, well, it would be the negative of that. So it would be positive 3. They are opposites of each other. So to go from one number to its opposite, you just multiply by negative 1. Multiply by negative 1. Multiply by negative 1. So to find the opposite of this polynomial, we just have to do the same thing. We have to multiply the polynomial by negative 1. So let's do that. It's going to be negative 1 times this entire expression. 2x squared minus 7x plus 13. And now remember, we're multiplying the entire expression times negative 1. So we have to distribute the negative 1. So this is going to be negative 1 times 2x squared. Plus negative 1 times negative 7x. So it's going to be the sum of negative 1 times each of the terms. So plus negative 1 times negative 7x. Plus negative 1 times positive 13. So what does this give us? This negative 1 times 2x squared is negative 2x squared. Negative 1 times negative 7 is positive 7. So this gives us plus 7x. And then negative 1 times 13 is negative 13. So minus 13. And we are done. Negative 2x squared plus 7x minus 13.
