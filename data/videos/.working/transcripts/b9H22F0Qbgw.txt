Consider the following coordinate pairs. I'm going to give us a bunch right over here. Which of those pairs is not graphed below? So let's see, 3, negative 2. So 3, negative 2. Well, actually, that looks like that first one is not graphed. So 3, negative 2 isn't graphed. And you can verify that all of these others do seem to be graphed. 4, negative 8 is right there. Negative 8, 3 is right over here. 4, 6. 4, 6 is right there. And negative 1, 0 is right there. So let's do a couple more of these. So it's negative 5, 0 graphed. Yep, it's right over there. Negative 4, positive 5 should be there. So that's not graphed. So we'll just select that one. Let's do one more of these. Negative 8, 4. So negative 8, 4. We got lucky. The first one is not graphed. Negative 8, 4. And we're done.
