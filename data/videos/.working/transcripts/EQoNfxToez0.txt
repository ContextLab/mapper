Slope is defined as your change in the vertical direction, and I could use the Greek letter delta, this little triangle here, the Greek letter delta, it means change in, change in the vertical direction, divided by change in the horizontal direction. That is the definition of slope, or the standard definition for slope, and it's a reasonable way for measuring how steep something is. So for example, if we're looking at the xy plane here, our change in the vertical direction is gonna be a change in the y variable, divided by change in the horizontal direction is gonna be a change in the x variable. And so let's see why that is a good definition for slope. Well, I could draw something with a slope of one. A slope of one might look something like, let me, I could start it over here, and let me get my line tool out. So slope of one, as x increases by one, y increases by one. As x increases by one, y increases by one. So slope of one is going to look like, is going to look like this. Is going to look like, is going to look like this. Notice, as I have a change in x, however much my change in x is, so for example here, my change in x is plus two, is positive two, I'm gonna have the same change in y. I'm gonna change in y is going to be plus two. So my change in y divided by change in x is two, divided by two is one. So for this line, I have a slope, slope is equal to one. But what would a slope of two look like? Well, a slope of two should be steeper, and we could draw that. A slope of two, I could start at that same point, actually why don't I start at the same point, and we'll see, but you don't have to, actually let me start at a different point. So if I start over, let's say here, a slope of two would look like, a slope of two would look like, for every one that I increase in the x direction, I'm gonna increase two in the y direction. So it's gonna look like, it is going to look like that. This line right over here, you see it. If my change in x is one, change in x is equal to one, my change in y, my change in y, my change in y is two. So change in y over change in x is gonna be two over one, the slope here is two. And now hopefully you're appreciating why this definition of slope is a good one. The higher the slope, the steeper it is. The faster it increases, the faster we increase in the vertical direction as we increase in the horizontal direction. Now what would a negative slope be? So let's just think about what a line with a negative slope would mean. Well a negative slope would mean that, well we could take an example. If we have our change in y over change in x was say, let's say it was equal to a negative one. That means that if we have a change in x of one, then in order to get negative one here, that means that our change in y would have to be equal to negative one. So a line with a negative slope, a negative one slope would look like, let me see if I can draw it, would look like, a negative one slope would look like, would look like this. Notice, as x increases, as x increases by a certain amount, so our delta x here is one, y decreases by that same amount instead of increasing. So now this is what we consider a downward sloping line. So change in y is equal to negative one. So our change in y over change in x, change in y over change in x, is equal to negative one over one, which is equal to negative one. So the slope of this line is negative one. Now if you had a slope with negative two, it would decrease even faster. So a line with a slope of negative two, it could look something like this. Let me draw it. So as x increases by one, y would decrease by two. As x increases by one, y would decrease by two. So it would look something like, let me see if I can, it would look like, it would look like that. Notice, as our x increases by a certain amount, our y decreases, decreases by twice as much. So this right over here has a slope, this has a slope of negative two. So hopefully this gives you a little bit more intuition for what slope represents and how the number that we use to represent slope, how you can use that to visualize how steep a line is. A very high positive slope as x increases, it's going to, y is going to increase fairly dramatically. If you have a negative slope, you're actually going to go from, you're actually going to go, as x increases, your y is actually going to decrease. And then the higher slope, the steeper in, the more you increase as x increases and the more negative the slope, the more you decrease as x increases.
