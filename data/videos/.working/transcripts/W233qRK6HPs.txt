So we have the function g of x, which is equal to two over x to the third minus one over x squared. And what I want to do in this video is I want to find, I want to figure out what g prime of x is, and then I also want to evaluate that at x equals two. So I want to figure that out, and I also want to figure out what does that evaluate to when x is equal to two. So what is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of g when x is equal to two? And like always, pause this video and see if you can work this out on your own before I work through it with you. And I'll give you some hints. All you really need to do is apply the power rule, a little bit of basic exponent properties, and some basic derivative properties to be able to do this. All right, now let's just do this together, and I'll just rewrite it. G of x is equal to this first term here, two over x to the third. Well, that could be rewritten as two times x to the negative three. We know that one over x to the n is the same thing as x to the negative n. So I just rewrote it, and now this might be ringing a bell of how the power rule might be useful. And then we have minus, well, one over x squared, that is the same thing as x to the negative two. And so this, if we're gonna take the derivative of both sides of this, let's do that. The derivative with respect to x, dx, we're gonna do that on the left-hand side. We're also going to do it on the right-hand side. Well, on the left-hand side, the derivative with respect to x of g of x, we can write that as g prime of x is going to be equal to, well, the derivative of this first, what we have right here written in green, this is going to be, we're just going to apply the power rule. We're going to take our exponent, multiply it by our coefficient out front. Actually, let me write that out. So that's going to be, let me finish this equal sign. That is going to be two times negative three times x, and now we're going to decrement this exponent. You have to be very careful here, because sometimes your brain might say, okay, one less than three is two, so maybe this is x to the negative two. But remember, you're going down. So if you're at negative three and you subtract one, we're going to go to the negative three minus one power. Well, that's going to take us to negative four. So this is x to the negative four power. So two times negative three x to the negative four, or we could have also written that, as negative six x to the negative four power. And then minus, well, we're going to do the same thing again right over here. We take this negative two, multiply it times the coefficient that's implicitly here. You could say there's a one there, so negative two times one. So you have the negative two there, and then you have the x to the, well, what's negative two minus one? Well, that's negative three to the negative three power. And so we can rewrite all of this business as the derivative g prime of x is equal to negative six, negative six x to the negative fourth. And now we're subtracting a negative, so we could just write this as plus two x to the negative three. This negative cancels out with that negative. Subtract a negative, the same thing as adding the positive. So we did the first part. We can express g prime of x as a function of x. Now let's just evaluate what g prime of two is. So g prime of two is going to be equal to negative six times two to the negative fourth power plus two times two to the negative third power. Well, what's this going to be? This is equal to negative six over two to the fourth plus two over two to the third, which is equal to negative six over, two to the fourth is 16, plus two over two to the third is eight. And so let's see, this is, we could rewrite this. Let's write all of this with a common denominator. I could write this as one fourth, but then this one won't work out as cleanly. I could write them both as eighths. This is negative three eighths, negative three eighths. So you have negative three eighths plus two eighths is equal to negative one eighth. So the slope of the tangent line at x equals two and the graph y equals g of x has a slope, or that slope is negative one eighth.
