So right here, we've listed two quantities, or two fluid volumes right over here in terms of gallons, one gallon and two gallons. And what I want to do in this video is try to convert this quantity of fluid, this volume of fluid, I want to convert it into these other units within the US customary system. So I encourage you to pause the video and first try to do the one gallon. Try to convert it into quarts, pints, cups, and fluid ounces. Well, one gallon is equal to four quarts. So we can just multiply by 4. One quart is equal to two pints. So we can multiply this by 2. So four quarts, each of them are two pints. Four times two gets us to eight pints. Each pint is equal to two cups. So we have eight pints. Each of them are equal to two cups. We're going to have 16 cups. And then finally, if we're converting from a cup to a fluid ounce, each cup is eight fluid ounces. So if we have 16 cups, it's going to be 16 times 8. That's the 8 times 8 is 64, and it's going to be twice that. That's going to be 128 fluid ounces. Now let's do the same thing with two gallons. Try to convert that into quarts, pints, cups, and fluid ounces. I encourage you to pause the video and try it on your own first. Well, same idea. One gallon is equivalent to four quarts. So two gallons are going to be two times four quarts, or eight quarts. Each quart is two pints. So if we want to go from quarts to pints, we'd want to multiply by two. So this is going to be 16 pints. And then each pint is two cups. So multiplying, if I have 16 of them, then that's going to be 32 cups. And then finally, each cup is eight ounces. Each cup is eight ounces. 32 times 8 is going to be, let's see, it's going to be 250, 256. And notice something here. When we went from one gallon to two gallons, we essentially increased the quantity of gallons by two, or we multiplied by two. And you see that across the board here. This is going from four quarts to eight quarts. This is going from eight pints to 16 pints. This is going from 16 cups to 32 cups, going from 128 fluid ounces to 256. Where essentially, when you increase the volume in gallons by a factor of two, you're of course going to increase the volume in any unit you measure it in by a factor of two.
