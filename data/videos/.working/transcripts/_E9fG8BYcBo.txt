So let's think about all of the different ways that we can represent seven nights. So let's just visualize seven nights. So here I have nine equal sections. And seven nights you could represent as seven of those equal sections. So let me get myself a bigger thing to draw with so that I can fill this in fast. I don't like how that looks. I'm going to use the paintbrush. So here we go. So that's one, two, three, four. You know where this is going. Five, six, and seven. So that's one way of representing seven nights. We already know that. That's not too interesting. But let's see if we can represent seven nights as a sum of other fractions. So let's imagine maybe we can represent it as, let's do it as two nights. Let me use a different brush here. So let's represent it as two nights, two over nine, plus, I don't know, let's see, maybe three over nine. But that doesn't quite get us to seven nights yet. Two over nine plus three over nine is going to get us to five over nine. So we're going to need two more. So it's going to be plus another two over nine. Plus another two over nine. So what would this look like? So let's just draw another grid here. So this is going to look like. I'll try to do it right below it so that we can see how they match up. So we have two nights. This two nights right over here, well, each of these is a ninth. We have nine equal sections. So we're going to get one and two. And then we're going to add three more nights. So one, two, three. So we add three nights right over there. And then two more nights. One and two. So notice, when I added two nights to three nights to two nights, this equals seven nights. And we know that when we add a bunch of fractions like this that have the same denominator, we can just add the numerator. And this is why. This is two nights plus three nights times two nights is going to give me seven nights. Let's do this one more time. This is actually a lot of fun. So let me draw my grid again. And then let's see what we can do. So let me get my pen tool out. Let me make sure my ink isn't too thick. Well, this is fine. And let's add a couple of nights here. So let's add first one ninth. And I'm going to just draw all the nines in blue. And let's add two nights. And then we could add, I don't know, maybe we could add, let me give some space here so we can add more. And maybe we could add three nights. And then we could add, let's see, that won't get us to see one ninth. Actually, let me just write this down. I'm going to try to add four fractions here. So let's add first one ninth. See where that gets us. So one ninth is going to get us right over here. So that's one ninth. So let's say we add two nights to that. So two nights. Two nights. Get my little paintbrush going on. So that's one. And two more. Two nights. So that still doesn't get us there. This gives us a total of three nights. One plus two is three. Three nights. So let's add, I don't know, let's add four nights. And I'll do that in this blue color. So four nights. Well, that's different enough. Four nights. So let's see where this gets us. Actually, well, why not? So four nights. And so that's going to get us one, two, three, four. So that looks like it got us all the way. Because one plus two plus four is going to give us seven, seven ninths. So what could we put here? Well, we could say zero nights. Why not? So we could put in, we could call this one right over here, zero nights. And how would we visualize that? We're saying none of these. No nights right over here. So this is one ninth plus two nights plus four nights is equal to seven nights. So these are all different ways to decompose to the exact same fraction.
