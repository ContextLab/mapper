So we need to find the cube root of negative 343. Another way to think about this, this is the same thing as negative 343 to the 1 third power. Or another way of thinking about it, if x to the third is equal to negative 343, so let me write if, x to the third is equal to negative 343, then x is equal to the cube root of negative 343. So these are all ways of viewing it. This is essentially saying there's some number, when I multiply it by itself three times, I should get negative 343. So let's figure out what this number is. And the easiest way I can think of doing it is to do a prime factorization of negative 343, including factoring out the negative numbers, or a negative 1. So if we factor out the negative 1, the first thing we get is negative 1 times 343. Let's think about what other prime number is going to 343. 2 doesn't go into it. This is an odd number. 3 doesn't go into it. If you add these numbers, it adds up to 7. That's not divisible by 3. That's a quick test for testing divisibility by 3. 5 doesn't go into it. Doesn't end with a 5 or a 0 here. Let's think 7 is the next prime number. Let's see if it goes into 343. 7 goes into 34. 4 times. 4 times 7 is 28. Subtract. 34 minus 28 is 6. Bring down the 3. 7 goes into 63 9 times. 9 times 7 is 63. Subtract. We have no remainder. So it goes in exactly 49 times. 343 is the same thing as 7 times 49. 49 is 7 times 7. It's 7 times 7. We can rewrite this expression up here. We can rewrite it as the cube root of negative 1 times 7 times 7 times 7. Another way to think about it, we could view this as being the cube root of negative 1 times 7 times 7 times 7. Now what's the cube root of negative 1? Whatcard to the third powers is equal to negative 1? Well, negative 1 to the third power is negative 1, right? Right? Negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1 is equal to negative 1. Right? This is equal to 1, then times negative 1 is equal to negative 1 again. So that's negative 1. And then what's the second part? What's the, what times itself 3 times is equal to 7 times 7 times 7? Well, 7. Right? This is literally 7 times itself 3 times. So the second part is 7. So the answer is going to be negative 1 times 7, or negative 7. Negative 7. And you can verify for yourself. You take negative 7, multiply it by itself 3 times. The negative part, you could use this negative 1 of the third power, will end up with a negative. And then the 7 to the third power will give you the 343.
