For an art project, a pentagon made of construction paper is cut into five equal slices. Two of the slices are removed. Write the remaining portion of the pentagon as a fraction. So let's draw ourselves a pentagon. A pentagon is just a five-sided figure. So it looks like this. It's also where the Department of Defense is located, a building that's actually in this shape. That's why they call it the pentagon. Let me draw a little nicer than that. So it looks something like this. My pentagon drawing skills need some work. There you go. That's a pretty decent shot of the pentagon. So that's the pentagon made out of construction paper. Notice it has one, two, three, four, five sides. That's why it's called a pentagon. And it's cut into five equal slices. So we could do that. Maybe that's the center of the pentagon. Here, this is one slice right there. That is two slices, three slices, four slices, and then a fifth slice. So you can imagine these are all equal slices. Now they're saying two of the slices are removed. So let's get rid of two of these slices. Let's say we remove that slice up there. And let's say we remove the slice right next to it, right over there. And then they want us to write the remaining portion of the pentagon as a fraction. So what are the remaining slices? Well, I have this slice right there, that slice right over here, and then this slice. So you have three slices remaining. Out of a total possible of how many slices are in the entire pentagon. So if you look at the entire pentagon, if you consider all of the slices, we have five slices. So if you consider the entire pentagon is made up of five total slices. So it's three remaining out of five total slices. So you could say that 3 fifths of the pentagon remain. Or you could say 2 fifths were removed. That's two of the five slices were removed. And then 3 are remaining, or 3 fifths of the pentagon remain.
