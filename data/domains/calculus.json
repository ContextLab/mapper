The notation ∫₁^∞ f(x)dx is a formal symbol representing a divergent process, and any finite value assigned to it is a convention rather than a genuine mathematical result. This is why improper integrals are excluded from the Riemann theory of integration and can only be handled using regularization schemes",
        "B": "An improper integral converges whenever the integrand f(x) is positive on the entire interval of integration, because positive functions accumulate area monotonically and the resulting limit of the partial integrals always exists and is finite. Divergence can occur only when the integrand oscillates between positive and negative values, creating destructive cancellation that can produce an undefined oscillating limit",
        "C": "An improper integral converges if and only if the integrand is continuous on the entire interval of integration including the point at infinity. Continuity ensures that the function does not blow up or oscillate wildly, which in turn guarantees that the area under the curve remains finite.

This perpendicularity follows from the chain rule: if r(t) is a curve on the level set, then f(r(t)) = c implies ∇f · r'(t) = 0, so ∇f is orthogonal to all tangent vectors of the level set",

The concept of uniform convergence was introduced historically by Weierstrass before Lebesgue's measure-theoretic framework made it obsolete, and in modern Lebesgue integration theory, pointwise convergence combined with a dominating function provides strictly stronger interchange theorems than uniform convergence can ever provide",
        "C": "Uniform convergence is a concept that matters only for sequences of polynomial functions, because only polynomials have the algebraic structure needed to make the 'same N works for all x' condition meaningful. For sequences of transcendental, piecewise-defined, or distribution-valued functions, the rate of convergence inherently varies with x in ways that cannot be captured by any single uniform bound, which is why functional analysis replaces uniform convergence with weaker topologies like weak convergence and convergence in distribution for non-polynomial function spaces",
        "D": "Uniform convergence means |fₙ(x) - f(x)| < ε for ALL x simultaneously (the same N works for every x), unlike pointwise convergence where N can depend on x. This is critical because: (1) the pointwise limit of continuous functions can be discontinuous, but the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous; (2) ∫ lim fₙ = lim ∫ fₙ is guaranteed under uniform convergence but can fail under pointwise convergence; (3) term-by-term differentiation of series requires uniform convergence of the derivative series"

For merely continuous functions that are not differentiable — such as the absolute value function |x| or the Weierstrass nowhere-differentiable function — no sequence of polynomials can converge uniformly, because the non-differentiable points create obstructions that smooth polynomials cannot approximate within any finite uniform error tolerance",

      "question_text": "The substitution method (u-substitution) is the reverse of the chain rule for integration. When applying u = g(x) to evaluate ∫f(g(x))g'(x)dx, what determines the success of a substitution, and what common mistake leads to incorrect results?",
      "options": {
        "A": "U-substitution works for every integral regardless of whether the derivative g'(x) appears in the integrand",
        "B": "A successful u-substitution requires that the integrand contain both a composite function f(g(x)) and the derivative g'(x) as a factor (up to a constant multiple) — the substitution u = g(x) transforms the integral to ∫f(u)du, and the common error is failing to transform ALL instances of x, including the differential, or neglecting to substitute back to x when computing definite integrals with the original limits",
        "C": "U-substitution applies only to polynomial integrands and cannot be used with trigonometric or exponential functions",
        "D": "The substitution changes only the integrand but not the differential or the limits of integration"
