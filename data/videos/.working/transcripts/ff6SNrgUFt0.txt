Alright, let's tackle part B now. Derive the magnitude of the acceleration of block two. Express your answer in terms of M1, M2, and G. And like always, try to pause the video and see if you can work through it yourself. We already worked through part one, or part A I should say, based on this diagram above, and there's a previous video, so now we're ready to do part B. And we've already drawn the free body diagrams, which will help us determine the acceleration of block two. Let's just think about what the acceleration is first. We know it's going to accelerate downwards because there's a couple of ways you can think about it. The weight of block two is larger than the weight of block one. They're connected by the string, so we know we're gonna accelerate downwards on the right-hand side and upwards on the left-hand side. The other way to think about it is the weight of block two is larger than the upward force of tension, and the weight of block one is less than the tension pulling upwards. So you're gonna accelerate upwards on the left-hand side, accelerate downwards on the right-hand side, and a key realization is the magnitude of the acceleration is going to be the same because they're connected by that string. So the acceleration, I'll just draw it a little bit away from the actual dot. So if the acceleration here has a magnitude A, it's gonna go in the downward direction, the acceleration on the left-hand side is gonna be the same magnitude that's gonna go in the upwards direction. So that just gives us a sense of things. And so they say derive the magnitude of the acceleration of block two. All right, so this is, let me leave the labels up there. So this is block two up here, and we know from Newton's second law that if we pick a direction, and the direction that matters here is the vertical direction. All the forces are acting in either the upwards or downwards direction. So the magnitude of our net forces and we care about the vertical dimension here is going to be equal to the mass times the acceleration in that dimension, in that direction, I guess you could say. And so let's just think about block two. Block, block two. And since the acceleration we know is downwards and we wanna figure out what A is, let's just assume that positive magnitude specifies downwards. So what are the net forces? Well, the net forces are gonna be the force of weight minus the tension, and that's gonna be positive if we think about it in the downward direction, the downward direction being positive. So we're gonna have m two g, the weight, minus the tension. The tension is going against the weight, minus the tension, is going to be equal to the mass, is going to be equal to m two times r m. Acceleration, and we need to figure out what that acceleration is going to be. So let me do that same blue color. Times the acceleration. Now we could divide both sides by m two, but that's not gonna help us too much just yet, because then we would have solved for acceleration in terms of m two g and t. We don't have any m ones here, so we're not solving in terms of m one, m two, and g. We're solving in terms of m two t and g. So somehow we have to get rid of this t. And what we can do to get rid of the t is set up a similar equation for block one. Block one, block one. Here, since we're concerned with magnitude, and especially the magnitude of acceleration, and here the acceleration is going in the upward direction, we could say that the upward direction is the positive direction, and so we could say that t minus, we know that the tension is larger than the weight, t minus m one g is going to be equal to, is equal to m one, is going to be equal to m one times the magnitude of the acceleration. And to be clear, these magnitudes are the same. And we already know that the magnitudes of the tension are the same, and now we have two equations with two unknowns. And so if we can eliminate the tension, we could solve for acceleration. And we can actually do that by just adding the left-hand side to the left-hand side and the right-hand side to the right-hand side. You learn this probably first in Algebra One. If this is equal to that and that is equal to that, if we add the left side to the left side and the right side to the right side, well, we're still gonna get two things that are equal to each other. So when you add the left-hand sides, what are you going to get? So you're gonna get m two g, m two g, minus m one g, minus m one g, and then you're gonna get t minus t. These two are going to cancel out, so let me just cross them out. So that was convenient. Is going to be equal to m two a, is going to be equal to m two a plus m one a. And now we just need to solve for a. And how do we do that? Well, we could factor out an a out of this right-hand side here. So this is going to be m two g minus m one g is equal to, let's factor out an a, a times m two plus m one, and then we're gonna get m two a. Plus m one. And now to solve for a, we just divide both sides by m two plus m one. M two plus m one. M two plus m one. And there you have it. We get a is equal to, a is equal to this. And notice, we have solved it, we have solved for a in terms of, we have solved for a in terms of m one, m two, and g. And this is the magnitude of the acceleration of either block one or block two. Now some of you might be thinking, wait, there might be an easier way to think about this problem. And I went straight from the free body diagrams, which is, you know, it's implied that this is the way to tackle it using the tension. But another way to tackle it, you could have said, well, this would be analogous, it's not the exact same thing, but it would be analogous to imagine two, these two blocks floating in space. So this is m two here, and I'm not gonna use pulleys here. So that's m two, and it's connected by a massless string to m one, which has a smaller mass, m one, and let's say that you are pulling on, pulling in the rightward direction, now we're just drifting in space with a force of m two g. We're not necessarily, you know, we just care about the magnitude here, and I know you might be saying, wait, okay, this is the gravitational field or whatever else, let's just say you're pulling in this direction with a force that happens to be equal to m, that has a magnitude of m two g, and let's say you're pulling in this direction with a force that has a magnitude of m one, m one g. Now this isn't exactly the same as where we started. Where we started, we saw what I've just kind of drawn, but I have it in the presence of a gravitational field, and I have it wrapped around those pulleys, and then the gravitational field is providing these forces. Let's just assume, just for simplicity, that you're drifting in space, and you're pulling on m two to the right with a force that's equivalent to m two g, and you are pulling to the left on m one with a force of m one g. Well you could just view this as one big, you could just view the m one, the string, and m two as just one combined mass. You could just view this as one combined mass of m one plus m two, and you could say, all right, well from that one combined mass, I am, whoops, from that one combined mass, I am pulling to the right with a magnitude of m two g, and I am pulling to the left, let me make that in a slightly different color so you can see it, and I am pulling to the left with a magnitude of m one g, and now this becomes a pretty straightforward thing. What would be the acceleration here? Well, you could say the net magnitude of the force, or the magnitude of the net force would be m two g. We'll take the rightward direction as the positive direction, m two g minus m one g, minus m one g, and then, so that's the net force in the right direction, the magnitude of the net force in the rightward direction, and then you divide it by its mass, and you're gonna get acceleration. Force divided by mass gives you acceleration. So you divide that by our mass, which is going to be, which is going to be m one plus m two, that's going to give you your acceleration. So you could view this as a simpler way of thinking about it, but they notice either of them give you the exact same answer, and that's one of the fun things about science, as long as you do logical things, you get to the same point.
