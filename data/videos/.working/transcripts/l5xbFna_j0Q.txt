Many 18th and 19th century romantic poets were believers in rebellion against social conventions, express strong emotion, and the power of imagination. So, spider sense is already sensing something a little bit off. So we're talking about many 18th and 19th century romantic poets. So we're talking about poets. So the poets were believers in rebellion against social conventions and express strong emotions. So, this is strange because the first part of this, we're listing the things that they did. So, the poets were believers in rebellion against social conventions, and they expressed strong emotions, or were believers in rebellion against social conventions, expressed strong emotions. So what's really troubling here, why this feels off, is that this, the were believers, were, this is in the past, this is in the past right over here, while express right over here, this is in the present. So the verb tense is off, and we're definitely talking about stuff in the past, 18th and 19th century romantic poets. So we're going to want to, all of these statements about them should be in the past. So it should be were believers in rebellion against social conventions, expressed strong emotions, and the power, or I guess express strong emotions and the power of imagination. So even this is a little bit strange. So let's just read the different choices. So we don't like it as is. So let's rule out A, that's always it unchanged as the underlined, the underlined part unchanged. So let's get the other choices. Many 18th and 19th century romantic poets are believers. So this is in the present, but clearly we're talking about things that happened in the past, 18th and 19th century poets. So we're going to rule this out. We don't like this happening in the present. Many 18th and 19th century romantic poets who believed in rebellion against social conventions, express strong emotions. So once again, we're keeping this part over here, this is in the present, express, it should be expressed, it should be in the past tense. We're talking about 18th and 19th century poets. We'll rule that one out. Many 18th and 19th century romantic poets believed in rebellion against social conventions to express strong emotions and the power of imagination. So this is strange because they didn't believe in rebellion against social conventions so that they could express strong emotions. The meaning here just seems off. So I hope that this one reads a lot better. Many 18th and 19th century romantic poets believed in rebellion against social conventions, so far so good, past tense, the expression of strong emotions and the power of imaginations. So this is really neat because what did the poets believe in? They believed in, and once again, it's past tense so that's good, and they believed in three things. It's very clearly articulated. They believed in rebellion against social conventions, that's the first thing they believed in. The second thing they believed in is the expression of strong emotions. And then the third thing that they believed in was the power of imagination. So this believed, this past tense, this action of believing in the past, this applies to these three clauses. They believed in rebellion against social conventions, the expression of strong emotions and the power of the imagination. What was really kind of bothering me up here in the original one is beyond this verb tense, they were believers and then they expressed strong emotion and then the power of imagination, is this something they're expressing? If all of these were things that they were expressing, they should have put the expressed out front. For several reasons, this first one was very strangely formed, but we really like E.
