Now that students can get access to the information delivery part of learning, the lectures at their own time and their own pace, and we also have an interactive portion where they can do problems, a lot of teachers are saying, well, why should I use the scarce class time for this kind of passive, I lecture, people listen, take notes. Instead, we could use that for actual interactivity. And it's different for every teacher, it's different for every classroom, but we've seen classrooms now when they come to class, they're doing problem solving. They have the teacher there to help them out, to tutor them, and they have their peers. The classes a lot of us grew up in, if you want to help your peer, you get in trouble with it, be quiet, listen. But now it's like, no, no, this is what it's all about, getting help from your peers, doing problem solving, doing open-ended projects, interacting with your teacher. What do you think your average, maybe not this, that's not the way to put it, how do you think a lot of classes are failing? What's wrong with the American education system in a typical classroom where it really isn't serving a student today? Yeah, and this is something I go into a lot of detail on in the book. All of the paranoia about our school system, we look at the national rankings, we're like, oh, we're behind Estonia and factoring polynomials, it's the end of the world, America's going to lose everything. We're kind of low on science and math, no way crazy. And we shouldn't get complacent about that. But one thing I point out is, if you look at the last 50 years, and you look at the innovation in the world, it's only been getting more and more concentrated in the U.S. If you look at the most innovative companies, the Facebooks, the Googles, the Twitters, they're all coming from America. And it's because we're the most creative country, it's innovative, failure isn't stigmatized. And so instead of this model of education that we have, where all the students are batched together in their passive lectures and they're pushed forward, this is a model inherited from Prussia, a country that does not exist anymore 200 years ago. And so what I point out, instead of trying to compare our Prussian model to the Prussian model in Singapore and the Prussian model in Finland, all of which are passive models, we should make our model more American, make it interactive when people come to the classroom, give room for creativity. If you get a C or a D, it's not about failure, it's about, well, make it better then. I find this fascinating in the context of something else, which is like the idea of stereotype threat. And this is this idea that sometimes in classrooms, some kids feel like there's a threat response, that they will be stereotyped if they ask questions when they don't understand something. The idea that you could go back and you don't understand it, you could listen to it again on your own and then seek help at another time or in your own pace. So for girls, sometimes feel this threat when they're in math classes. They found that African Americans feel this threat a lot of times in classes in general, that they feel like they're asking questions that they shouldn't be asking and therefore they don't do it. And this seems like it gets around that whole concept. Am I right on the thought? You're hitting, I think, the core problem when people say, oh, but in lecture I can ask questions. I was like, no, three people have the guts to ask a question. And if you're in an algebra class and you forgot how to multiply decimals or you forgot, you don't even know your multiple, maybe you don't know, and we've seen this in some algebra classes, there's no way you're going to raise your hand and say, wait, I forgot my fourth grade math. Okay, you've taught more classes on Khan Academy than Harvard University has offered since its founding. What is your vision for future of education globally? We want to keep growing, get to hundreds of millions of students. We've translated our content into 12 languages. It's being used around the world. We want to become more interactive and we hope that the conversation isn't just about a lot of the, within this Prussian model, how do we tweak the system, but it's about time, it's been 200 years that we can actually fundamentally rethink the model. So it's not this passive system. It's much more...
