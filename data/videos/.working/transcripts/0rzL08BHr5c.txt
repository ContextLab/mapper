Let's say that we have the function f of x is equal to x squared plus one. And what we want to do is we want to figure out the average value of our function f on the interval, on the closed interval between zero and, let's say between zero and three. And I encourage you to pause this video, and especially if you've seen the other videos on introducing the idea of the average value of a function, figure out what this is. What is the average value of our function f over this interval? So I'm assuming you've had a go at it. Let's just visualize what's going on, and then we can actually find the average. So that's my y-axis. This is my x-axis. Now over the interval between zero and three, so let's say that this is zero. This is one, two, three. It's a closed interval. When x is zero, f of zero is going to be one. So we're going to be right over here. f of one is two. So it's going to be one, two, three. Actually, let me make my scale a little bit smaller on that. I have to go all the way up to ten. So this is going to be ten. This is going to be five. And then one, two, three. This is the hardest part, is making this even. So let's see. This is going to be in the middle. Pretty good. And then let's see in the middle. And then we have that. No, good enough. So we're going to be there. I have obviously different scales for x and y-axes. Two squared plus one is five. Three squared plus one is ten. Three squared plus one is ten. So it's going to look something like this. This is what our function is going to look like. So that's the graph of y is equal to f of x. And we care about the average value on the interval, closed interval, between zero and three. So one way to think about it, you could apply the formula. But it's very important to think about what does that formula actually mean. And once again, you shouldn't memorize this formula because it actually kind of falls out of what it actually means. So the average of our function is going to be, it's going to be equal to the definite integral over this interval. So essentially the area under this curve. So it's going to be the definite integral from zero to three of f of x, which is x squared plus one dx. And then we're going to take this area. We're going to take this area right over here. And we're going to divide it by the width of our interval to essentially come up with the average height or the average value of our function. So we're going to divide it by b minus a, or three minus zero, which is just going to be three. And so now we just have to evaluate this. So this is going to be equal to 1 third times, see the antiderivative of x squared is x to the third, or three. Antiderivative of one is x. And we're going to evaluate it from zero to three. And so this is going to be equal to 1 third times, when we evaluate it at three. Let me use another color here. When we evaluate it at three, it's going to be three to the third divided by three. Well, that's just going to be 27 divided by three. That's nine plus three. And then when we evaluate it at zero, minus zero, minus zero. So it's just minus, when you evaluate it at zero, it's just going to be zero. And so we are left with, I want to make the brackets that same color. This is going to be 1 third times 12, which is equal to four. So this is the average value of our function. The average value of our function over this interval is equal, the average value of our function is equal to four. And notice, our function actually hits that value at some point in the interval. Something lower than two, but greater than one. We could maybe call that c. It looks like our function hits that value. And this is actually a generally true thing. This is a mean value theorem for integrals. And we'll go into more depth there. But you can see that this kind of does look like its average value. That if you imagine the box, if you multiply this height, this average value times this width, you would have this area right over here. And this area right over here is the same. This area that I'm highlighting in yellow right over here is the same as the area under the curve. Because we have the average height times the width is the same thing as the area under the curve. So anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.
