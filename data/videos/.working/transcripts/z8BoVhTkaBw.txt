Find the measurement of angle CAD. So angle CAD. So this angle right over here, the measure of that angle. Now let's just call it X so that I don't have to keep writing the measure of angle CAD. And the one thing that might jump out at you is that the other angles measures are given here. 50 degrees, 45 degrees, and 37 degrees. The other thing that might jump out at you is if you take the outer edge of all of these angles which are adjacent to each other, if you take the outer edge, it forms a straight angle. So this entire angle is going to be 180 degrees. Or another way to think about it, the measure of each of these angles when you add them all together need to be equal to 180 degrees. And that's what we need to solve this problem. Because we have X plus 50, 50 in orange, X plus 50 plus 45 plus 37 is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And now these, let's see, 50 plus 45 is 95. 95 plus 30 is 125. Plus 7 is 132. So all of that is 132. We can subtract 132 from both sides. 132, subtract 132. On our left-hand side, we're left just with an X. On our right-hand side, 180 minus 32 is 48. And we're done. X is equal to, the measure of this angle right over here, is equal to 48 degrees.
