Alma and Blanca are playing a game where they roll a six-sided pair of dice and try to predict the outcomes. Blanca thinks that the probability of rolling a 1 and a 5 is greater than the probability of rolling a 1 or a 5. Alma disagrees. She thinks that the probability of rolling a 1 or a 5 is greater. Based on the sample space of possible outcomes listed below, who is correct? Alma or Blanca? Well, we could just look straight at the sample space and see how many of these outcomes satisfy each of these situations. So the probability of rolling a 1 and a 5, well look from this grid here, we see that there are 36 equally likely outcomes. And how many of them involve rolling a 1 and a 5? So this is a 1 and a 5, is this one. That's 1 and a 5. And you also have a 1 and a 5 right over here. There's exactly 2 out of these 36 equally likely outcomes that involve a 1 and a 5. So there is a 1 over 18 chance of this happening, or you could say the probability is 1 18th. Now what's the probability of rolling a 1 or a 5? Well a 1 or a 5, so probability of 1 or a 5, well all of these involve, all of these over here involve a 1, my pen, it's digital pen but it looks like it's running out of ink. Those all involve a 1 and all of these involve a 5. All of these involve a 5 right over here. All over these involve a 5. Those involve a 5. And actually, actually we're not done yet. We have all of these involving a 1 right over here. And you have all of these involving a 5. This was 1 for the first die, 5 for the first die. These are 1 for the second die, 5 for the second die. So how many total outcomes are there? Well it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. So it's 20 out of the 36 equally likely outcomes. Or if we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4, we get 5 over 9ths. 5 9ths of the equally likely outcomes involve a 1 or a 5. So clearly 5 9ths is larger than 1 18ths. 5 9ths is the same thing as 10 18ths. So the probability of a 1 or a 5 is greater. So Alma was right. Alma thinks that the probability of rolling a 1 or a 5 is greater. So who is correct? Alma. Alma is correct. Now it was good to go through this exercise of identifying the subset of our sample space that meets each of these situations. But you could have just thought about it as well even if you didn't have the sample space in front of you. What Blanca was saying, the probability of a 1 and a 5, you have to have a 1 and a 5. That's a much more stringent constraint than a 1 or a 5. A 1 or a 5 is going to include many, many more things. It's going to include a 2 and a 1, a 3 and a 1. It's going to include a 5 and a 3, not just a 5 and a 1. So just without even looking at this, without actually having to calculate these probabilities, you could have said, look, what Alma is saying has a higher probability. It makes sense because she's placing a much looser constraint, a 1 or a 5, not 1 and a 5.
