Hi everyone, Sal Khan here from Khan Academy. And I just wanted to give a huge shout out and thank you to Elon Musk and everyone at the Musk Foundation for their incredibly generous support for Khan Academy. They just recently gave a $5 million donation to Khan Academy. Elon, I hope you really feel good about this. This is going to allow us to accelerate all sorts of content. Our aspirations are all subjects from K through the early stages of college. This will accelerate our science content, allow us to do more on early learning, allow us to make the software and the practice that much more engaging for millions of students around the world, for teachers around the world. And as far as Khan Academy has come, we have 120 million registered users, 20 or 30 million students using the platform every month. We have about 200 million hours of learning a year, which any way you wanna evaluate that, that's worth a lot to the world. And when you look at our efficacy studies and how we've been able to move the dial in classrooms, just that social return to investment ratio is 400 to 500 to one. A good return in the philanthropic sector is considered a five to one ratio or 10 to one ratio. So as much as progress has been made, I think you appreciate, and hopefully everyone watching appreciates that there's many billions who need this. There's people throughout the planet who need a way to tap into their potential. And I view this type of investment in what we're doing as really foundational for us to be able to build a multi-generational institution so that future Elon Musk's of the world are also able to tap into their potential and help all of us up level who we are as a civilization. For everyone listening, I wanna remind folks that as incredible as this donation is, and it really is incredible, that we do need more help. We continue to be running at a deficit for 2021. So every donation of every size helps, and we're able to take every one of those dollars, and it helps us accelerate learning in a whole bunch of dimensions. The world as a whole spends $5 trillion on education annually. Khan Academy's budget is 1,100,000th of that. We are the budget of a large high school, but our aspirations are to serve the globe. So hopefully more folks listening at all scales can help support what we're trying to do. And the last thing I'll mention, it's especially powerful to get a donation from you, Elon. I had the privilege of interviewing you back in 2013 when you visited our office, and someone on YouTube commented, I wanna find someone who looks at me the same way that Sal looks at Elon, and they were catching on to something. I do look up to you in an incredible way. Anytime that I question even myself, and I say, is this mission too big to actually try to educate all of humanity? I think of the incredible work that you've done. I remember back in 2013 when I interviewed you, pretty much everything you said you were going to do, and you made some pretty large statements, you have either done, or you are very close to doing right now. And I take incredible inspiration that it is not too big of a mission, that if anything, we cannot shy away right now from this goal, just as we shouldn't shy away from solving climate, solving transportation, being able to colonize other planets, we can't shy away from educating the planet and other planets going forward. So thank you so much, and I look forward to going on this journey with all of y'all.
