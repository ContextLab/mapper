We now hopefully know a little bit about variables, and as we covered in the last video, a variable can be really any symbol, although we typically use letters because we're used to writing and typing letters, but it can be anything from an X to a Y, a Z, an A, a B, and so oftentimes we'll start using Greek letters like theta, but you can really use any symbol to say, hey, this is going to vary, it can take on multiple values. But out of all of these, the one that's most typically used in algebra, or really in all of mathematics, is the variable X, although all of these are used to some degree. But given that X is used so heavily, it does introduce a slight problem. And the problem is, it looks a lot like the multiplication symbol, or the one that we use in arithmetic. So in arithmetic, if I want to write two times three, I literally write two times three. But now that we're starting to use variables, and if I want to write two times X, well, if I use this as the multiplication symbol, it would be two times X, and the times symbol, and the X look awfully similar. And if I'm not really careful with my penmanship, it can get very confusing. Is this two XX, is this two times times something? What exactly is going on here? And because this is confusing, this right over here is extremely confusing, and it can be misinterpreted, we tend to not use this multiplication symbol when we are doing algebra. Instead of that, to represent multiplication, we have several options. Instead of writing two times X this way, we could write two dot X. And this dot, I want to be very clear, this is not a decimal. This is written a little bit higher, and we write this so we don't get confusion between this and one of these variables right here. But this really can be interpreted as two times X. So for example, if someone says two dot X, what is two dot X when X is equal to three? Well, this would be the same thing as two times three when X is equal to three. Another way that you could write it is you could write two, and then you could write the X in parentheses right next to it. This is also interpreted as two times X. So if in this situation X were seven, this would be two times seven or 14. And then the most traditional way of doing it is to just write the X right after the two. And sometimes this will be read as two X. But this literally does mean two times X. And you might say, well, how come we didn't always do that? Well, it'd be literally confusing if we did it over here. If we just wrote, instead of writing two times three, we just wrote two, three, well, that looks like 23. This doesn't look like two times three, and that's why we never did it. But here, since we're using a letter now, it's clear that this isn't part of that number. This isn't 20-something. This is two times this variable X. So all of these are really the same expression, two times X, two times X, and two times X. And so with that out of the way, let's try a few worked examples, a few practice problems, and this will hopefully prepare you for the next exercise where you get a lot of chance to practice this. So if I were to say, what is 10 minus three, three Y, and what is this equal when Y is equal to two? Well, every time you see the Y, you'd want that two there. So this is when Y is equal to two. Let's set that Y equal to two. This is the same thing. This is the same thing as 10 minus three times two. You do the multiplication first. Multiplication takes precedence in order of operations. So three times two is six, is six, 10 minus six, 10 minus six is equal to four. Let's do another one. Let's say that we had, I don't know, seven X minus four, and I'm gonna do that in that same green color, seven X minus four. And we want to evaluate that when X is equal to three. Where will we see the X? We wanna put a three there. So this is the same thing as seven times three, seven, and I'll actually use this notation because I can use that with numbers, seven times three minus four. And once again, multiplication takes precedence by order of operations over addition or subtraction. So we wanna do the multiplying first. Seven times three is 21. 21 minus four is equal to 17. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of background. It really encourage you to try the next exercise. It'll give you a lot of practice on being able to evaluate expressions like this.
