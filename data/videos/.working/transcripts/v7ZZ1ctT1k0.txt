We're asked which of the following vectors have the same x component as vector a, and they tell us to select all that apply. So this is vector a right over here, and we only have to concern ourselves with the x component. That's what they're asking us about. So let's think about what its x component is. We're starting at this point right over here, which has an x value of negative two, and we're going from negative two to, or we're going from x equals negative two to x is equal to negative five. So our change in x, or another way to think about it, our x component, we're going from negative two to negative five. We just, our x value goes down by three. So we have negative three. We could say our change in x is equal to negative three, or that would also be the x component of vector a. We could say that vector a is equal to, its x component is negative three. We're not concerning ourselves with our y component, but we see that our y goes up by one. So it's negative three comma one. But we just want to, we just care about our x component. So let's think about what other vectors here have an x component of negative three, that if we start at our initial point and go to the terminal point, our x value has gone down by three. Well, we're going to start with vector b here, and let's see if we start there. If we start, our x value is three at our initial point, our starting point for that vector, and then to go to the x value of the terminal point, we once again, we went down by three. So this has the same x component. Vector b, vector b is going to be negative three comma something. So I will select that one. Now let's think about vector c. Vector c starts here at x equals negative four, and then it ends at x equals negative one. So its x component is going to look, one way to think about it, our change in x is going to look like this. And you might be tempted to say this is the same thing. It has a length of three, but notice we're not going three to the left the way that we did in vector a or in vector b. We're going three to the right. So here our change in x is positive three. And so vector c, vector c is going to be positive three comma something. So it's not going to be vector c. Now let's look at vector d. Vector d starts over here. Its x value is negative six, and we're going from x equals negative six to x equals negative nine. So once again, we have gone down. Our change in x is negative three. So that has the same x component. If I were to say vector d, I would say it's negative three comma something. I haven't figured out what these are, but I don't need to for this problem. So vector d also has the same x component, of negative three. And we're done.
