We've already seen that the fraction 2 fifths, or a fraction like the fraction 2 fifths, can be literally represented as 2 times 1 fifth, which is the same thing, which is equal to literally having 2 1 fifths, so 1 fifth plus 1 fifth. And if we wanted to visualize it, let me make a hole here and divide it into 5 equal sections. And so this represents 2 of those fifths. This is the first of the fifths, and then this is the second of the fifths, literally 2 fifths. Now let's think about something a little bit more interesting. What would 3 times 2 fifths represent? 3 times 2 fifths. And I encourage you to pause this video. And based on what we just did here, think about what you think this would be equivalent to. Well, we just saw that 2 fifths would be the same thing as, so let me just rewrite this as instead of 3 times 2 fifths written like this, let me write 2 fifths like that. So this is the same thing as 3 times 2 times 1 fifth. 3 times 2 times 1 fifth. And multiplication, we could multiply the 2 times the 1 fifth first and then multiply by the 3. Or we could multiply the 3 times the 2 first and then multiply by the 1 fifth. So you could view this literally as being equal to 3 times 2 is, of course, 6. So this is the same thing as 6 times 1 fifth. And if we were to try to visualize that again, so that's a hole. That's another hole. Each of those holes have been divided into 5 equal sections. And so we're going to color in 6 of them. So that's the first fifth, second fifth, third fifth, fourth fifth, fifth fifth. And that gets us to a hole. And then we have 6 fifths just like that. So literally, 3 times 2 fifths can be viewed as 6 fifths. And of course, 6 times 1 fifth or 6 fifths can be written as, so this is equal to literally 6. Let me do the same color. 6 fifths. 6 over 5. Now you might have said, well, what if we, instead of viewing 2 fifths as this, as we just did in this example, we viewed 2 fifths as 1 fifth plus 1 fifth. What would happen then? Well, let's try it out. So 3 times 2 fifths, I'll rewrite it. 3 times 2 fifths. 2 over 5 is the same thing as 3 times 1 fifth plus 1 fifth. 2 fifths is the same thing as 1 fifth plus 1 fifth. So 3 times 1 fifth plus 1 fifth, which would be equal to, well, I just have to have literally 3 of these added together. So it's going to be 1 fifth plus 1 fifth plus 1 fifth plus 1 fifth plus, I think you get the idea here, plus 1 fifth plus 1 fifth. Well, what's this going to be? Well, we literally have 6 fifths here. We could ignore the parentheses and just add all of these together. We, once again, have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 fifths. So once again, this is equal to 6 fifths. So hopefully this shows that when you multiply the 2 fifths, we saw already represents 2 1 fifths. We already saw that. Or 2 times 1 fifth. And 3 times 2 fifths is literally the same thing as 3 times 2 times 1 fifth. In this case, that would be 6 fifths.
