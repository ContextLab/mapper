This is Steve, and this is Steve's uncle. And Steve is in a bit of a bind. Not only does he not have any money, but he also owes Michael, who is not depicted here, he owes Michael $3. So he actually has a negative net worth. Steve has a net worth of negative 3. Steve's uncle cares about Steve, and feels bad that he doesn't even have a zero net worth. He has a negative net worth. And so Steve's uncle wants to at least take away some of this pain. He at least wants to get Steve back to a neutral net worth, a zero net worth. And so he decides to take away. So he wants to take away that negative 3. Well, what happens if you take away that negative 3? Well, that should get you back to zero. If you take away anything, if you have something and you take it away, it should go back to zero. So similarly, if you owe people things, and that owing people things is taken away, it also gets back to zero. And another way to think about it is how Steve's uncle would actually take that liability, take that debt away from Steve. Well, the easiest way he could do it, if Steve is starting at negative 3 net worth, is for his uncle to just give Steve $3. Is to just give him $3, so that he can get back to a net worth of zero. So hopefully, that makes it a little bit clearer that this and this are intuitively equivalent.
