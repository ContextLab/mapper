        "A": "Because nonlinear positive feedbacks among subsystems can amplify small changes, pushing the system past a threshold and causing rapid reorganization (with possible hysteresis).",

      "options": {
        "A": "Because the phase transition point is defined by G_phase1 = G_phase2, meaning there is no net thermodynamic driving force to transform one phase into the other; this equality allows both phases to coexist at equilibrium and means that arbitrarily small changes in temperature/pressure will tip the balance toward the phase with the slightly lower G.",

        "A": "The emitted wave's energy increases with distance, creating a unique time signature that encodes position.",
        "B": "The returned signal's frequency shift alone encodes height because frequency is inversely proportional to distance.",
        "C": "The signal travels at a known finite speed; the round-trip travel time is proportional to distance, enabling distance estimation, and the Doppler shift of the returned signal provides the radial velocity; by scanning, the azimuth/elevation (direction) is obtained.",
        "D": "The atmosphere's refractive index is constant, so the strength of the backscatter maps to height."
