Suppose we multiply a complex number z by negative three i and they show us z right over here. Plot the point that represents the product of z and negative three i. So pause this video and see if you can work through that. All right, now let's do it step by step. First I want to think about what would, where would three z be? Well three z would have the same angle as z, but its absolute value or its modulus would be three times larger. So you'd be going in this direction, but it'd be three times further. So that's one times its modulus, that's two times its modulus, that's three times its modulus, or it's three times its absolute value. So three z would be right over here. Now what about negative three z? Well if you multiply it by a negative, it's just going to flip it around. You could think about it as flipping it at 180 degrees, but it's going to have the same modulus. So instead of being right over here at three in this direction, it's going to be one, two, three in this direction right over here. So that is negative three z. And now perhaps most interestingly, what happens when you multiply it by i? So if we have negative three i times z now, which is exactly what they want us to figure out. Well let's think about what happens if you had one and if you multiplied it by i. So one times i becomes one i, so it goes over there. What if you then took one i and multiplied it by i? Well then you have negative one. What if you took negative one and you multiplied it by i? Well then now you have negative one i. So notice every time we multiply by i, we are rotating by 90 degrees. So over here, if we take negative three z and multiply it by i, you're just going to rotate 90 degrees, and you're going to get right over there. So this is negative three i times z, which is exactly what we were looking for.
