We have two polar graphs here. R is equal to three sine theta and R is equal to three cosine theta. What we want to do is find this area shaded in blue that's kind of the overlap of these two circles. So, encourage you to pause the video and give it a go. All right, so I assume you've tried. And what's interesting here is we're clearly bounded by two different polar graphs. And it looks like they intersect right over here. If we eyeball it, it looks like they're intersecting at when theta is equal to pi over four. And we can verify that. Cosine of pi over four is the same thing as sine of pi over four. So, it is indeed the case that these two things are going to be equal to each other. They're going to be, their point of intersection happens at theta is equal to pi over four. And if that wasn't as obvious, you would set these two equal to each other and figure out the theta is where this actually happened. But here it jumps out at you a little bit more. So, this is theta is equal to pi over four. And so, the key is to realize is that for theta, theta being between zero and pi over four, we're bounded by the red circle. We're bounded by three R is equal to three sine theta. And then as we go from pi over four to pi over two, we're bounded by the black circle. We're bounded by R is equal to three cosine theta. So, we could just break up our area into those two regions. So, this first area right over here, we already know is going to be 1 half times the definite integral from zero to pi over four, zero to pi over four of, what are we bounded by? Three sine of theta, three sine of theta. And we're gonna square that thing, d theta. That's the orange region. And then this, I guess you could say this blue region right over here is going to be 1 half times the definite integral. And now we're gonna go from pi over four to pi over two, to pi over two of three cosine theta squared d theta. That's this region right over here. Now, one thing that might jump out, you is that they're gonna be the same area. That these two circles, they are, I guess you could say, symmetric around this line. Theta is equal to pi over four. So, these are going to be the same area. So, one thing that we could do is just solve for one of these and then double it. And we will get the total region that we care about. So, the total area, and you can verify that for yourself if you like, but I'm just gonna say that the total area, I'm just gonna double this right over here. So, the total area, if I just double this, just the orange expression, I'm gonna get the definite integral from zero to pi over four of, let's see, let me just, of nine, three squared is nine, sine squared theta d theta. And you could evaluate this by hand. You could evaluate this calculator. Let's evaluate this analytically. So, sine squared theta is the same thing as 1 1 by 2 times 1 minus, 1 1 by 2 times 1 minus cosine of two theta. That's a trigonometric identity that we've seen a lot in trigonometry class. Actually, let me just write it up here. So, sine squared theta is equal to 1 1 by 2 times one minus cosine of two theta. So, if we replace this with this, it's going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, let's take the 1 1 by 2 out. So, we're gonna get nine halves times the definite integral from zero to pi over four of one minus cosine two theta d theta. And so, this is going to be equal to nine halves, nine halves, antiderivative of one is theta. And let's see, cosine two theta, it's going to be, it's going to be negative sine of two theta. Did I do that? Negative, negative sine of two theta over two. Over two, actually let me, so this is negative one half sine of two theta. And you could do u-substitution and do it like this, but this you might be able to do it in your head. And you can verify the derivative of sine of two theta is going to be two cosine of two theta, and then you multiply it times the negative one half, you just get a negative one right over there. And so then we are going to evaluate this at pi over four and at zero. So if you evaluate it at, well, luckily if we, let's see, if we evaluate this thing at zero, this whole thing is going to be zero. So we really just have to evaluate it at pi over four. So this is going to be equal to nine halves times pi over four minus one half sine of two times pi over four is pi over two. Sine of pi over two, sine of pi over two, we already know is one. So it is really pi over four, so this right over here is just going to be equal to one. So this is going to be nine halves times, we could say pi over four minus one half, or we could say pi over four minus two over four. So we could write it like that, or we could multiply everything out. Or we could say this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to nine pi minus nine pi minus 18 over eight. And we are done.
