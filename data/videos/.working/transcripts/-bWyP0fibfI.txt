Hey everybody, Rocco T. Mole here to wish you a happy mole day from all of us at Khan Academy. Yes, moles. The chemistry concept. That's a critter. Now, in case you've been living under a rock, like me, a mole is another name for Avogadro's number, which is 6.02 x 10 to the 23rd. Kind of like how a dozen is another name for 12, so why do we need a name for such a big number? Well, we could write it out like this. Thank you. But that would take a while. Moles make counting easier for chemists, particularly when talking about atoms or molecules. So, for the number of molecules in a cup of water, you could write an 8 with 24 zeros after it. Or, you could just call it 13 moles of water instead. Thank you, Rocco. Isn't that easier? Now, the moral of this story is moles are the best. And if you want to learn more about chemistry, or anything, really, head to our website, conacademy.org. That's con as in gangus, no relation, and academy as in academy. Happy mole day, everyone. You can learn anything. Thank you.
