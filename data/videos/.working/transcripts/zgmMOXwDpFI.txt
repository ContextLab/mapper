We're told that Kendrick drinks juice while he drives to work each day. He recorded the amount of juice he drinks in milliliters and how long in minutes his drive took for five days this week. And so they give us a little table. So depending on how much, well, they're showing how much juice he drank in a day and how long his drive took. I wonder if there's a relationship, that'd be a little bit strange. But what we wanna do here is draw a scatter plot where we have time in the vertical axis and we have juice in the horizontal axis. So let's do that together. So the first point right over here, time or juice is 175 milliliters, time is 13. So what we wanna do here is go to 175 in terms of milliliters of juice and then 13 minutes in terms of time. So that would be a point right over there. And I'm just going to keep doing that. Next, we have 250, 16. So we would go to 250 and then 16. And then we have 150 and 20. 150 and 20, which is right there. Next, we have 125, 12. So that is 125, 12 is this point. And then last but not least, 225, 14. So 225 and then 14. And we're done. We have just constructed the scatter plot for that information.
