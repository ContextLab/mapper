We are asked to draw the image of triangle ABC under a dilation whose center is P and scale factor is 1 fourth. So pause this video and at least think about how you would do this. You don't have access to the tool that I do where I can move this around. This is actually from the Khan Academy exercise. But at least think about how you would do this. Draw the image of triangle ABC under a dilation whose center is P and scale factor is 1 fourth. All right, now let's work through this together. So one way to think about it is our center of dilation is P and our scale factor is 1 fourth. So for each of these points, however far they were from P before, they're now going to be 1 fourth as far. And one way to think about it is is to think about it in each of the X and the Y dimensions. So for example, point A right over here, to get from point P to point A, you have to go one, two, three, four to the right and one, two, three, four down. So one fourth of that in the X and the Y direction, instead of going four to the right and four down, one fourth of that would be one to the right and one down, because one is one fourth of four. So instead of four to the right, we'd go one to the right. And instead of four down, we would go one down. So this is what point A would get mapped to. And now let's think about point B. In order to go from P to point B, you have to go in the Y direction up, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Well, what's one fourth of eight? It's two. So now we're going to go up two. And to go from P to B, how much do we have to go in the X direction? Well, we have to go to the left, one, two, three, four. So instead of going four to the left, we're now going to go one fourth of that or just one to the left. So instead of eight up and four left, we're now going two up and one to the left, one fourth in each direction. And then last but not least, to go from P to C, it looks like we're going one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight to the left, and one, two, three, four up. So if we take one fourth of each of those, instead of eight to the left, we're now going to go two to the left. Instead of four up, we're now going to go one up. And we're done. We have just created the image of triangle ABC under a dilation who centers P and scale factor is one fourth.
