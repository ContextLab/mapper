We're told the system of linear equations below is graphed on the coordinate grid. Okay, we see that. Then it says, what is the value of y equals negative x minus seven when x is equal to negative eight? So the graph y equals negative x minus seven, that's this blue line here. And they tell us that the point negative eight comma one is on that line. So when x is equal to negative eight, y is equal to one, so we could type that in. And then they ask us, what is the y value of the bronze line or the brown line here? Y is equal to one half x minus one when x is equal to negative eight. So we don't even have to compute it. We see when x is equal to negative eight, we get y is equal to negative five. So we put negative five there. And then they say, is x equal negative eight a solution? Well, the only way that x equals negative eight would be a solution is if the y value of those lines when x equals negative eight were the same. But they're clearly not. And in fact, we would see it visually. If it was a solution, the two lines would intersect at that point, but they don't. There's actually two different points here. They don't overlap. So this is not a solution and we're done.
