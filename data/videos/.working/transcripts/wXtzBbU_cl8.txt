We are asked, what is the constant of proportionality in the equation for y is equal to eight x? Pause this video and have a go at this question. All right, so we might be used to seeing constants of proportionality when we have equations in a slightly different form. A constant of proportionality is, what do you multiply x by to get to y? So y would be equal to our constant of proportionality times x, times x. But this isn't written in that form. So what we do is manipulate it a little bit so that we can see it in that form. And the obvious thing is we just need to solve for y. So right now it says four y is equal to eight x. Well if we wanna solve for y, we can just divide both sides by four. And we are left with y is equal to eight divided by four, which is two times x. Well now the constant of proportionality jumps out at us. To get y, we have to multiply x by two. That is our constant of proportionality. Let's do another example. Here we're asked, which equation has a constant of proportionality equal to one half? Again, pause the video, try to enter it yourself. Okay, so I'm just gonna go equation by equation and calculate their constants of proportionality and see which one has a constant of proportionality equal to one half. So this one right over here, choice A, clearly has a constant of proportionality of 1 eighth. So we can just rule that out. Equation B right over here clearly has a constant of proportionality of four, not one half. So we could rule that one out. Let's see the constant of proportionality for equation C. If we wanna solve for y, we could divide both sides by six. And so we're gonna get y is equal to 3 six times x. Well 3 six is the same thing as one half times x. And so there you have it. We have a constant of proportionality of one half. That's the choice I like. And we can verify that this one doesn't work. If you want to solve for y, you divide both sides by three and you get y is equal to nine divided by three is 3x. So here our constant of proportionality is three. So we can feel good about choice C.
