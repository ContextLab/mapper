The pH of the soft drink is 3.37 after the addition of the potassium sorbate. Which species, the sorbic acid or the sorbate ion, has a higher concentration in the soft drink? Justify your answer. So this is related to the question we've been doing because the sorbate ion, this is what happens when you put potassium sorbate and it disassociates in a solution. So the concentration of the sorbate ion is the same thing as the concentration, one way to think about it is going to be the same as the concentration of your potassium sorbate. And so if we're thinking about titrating potassium sorbate, which we've been doing in the last several parts of the problem, at what point do you have an equal concentration of potassium sorbate and sorbic acid? Well you have equal concentrations at the half equivalence point. We marked that out when we figured it out in the last few parts of this problem. And the half equivalence point happened at a pH of four point, we actually figured it out before, 4.77. So we could say, we could say half equivalence point, half, half equivalence, half equivalence point of titration of potassium sorbate, potassium sorbate with hydrochloric acid, happens, happens at a pH of, let me write that, pH of 4.77. And that's the point at which you have equal concentrations of, so we can put this in parentheses, can be viewed as point where we have equal concentrations, concentrations of C6H7O2 minus and the sorbic acid, H-C6H7O2. pH of 3.77, pH of 3.37 is lower and will thus, or we could say will happen beyond half equivalence point, beyond half equivalence, equivalence point. So concentration of the sorbic acid is higher. So concentration, concentration of sorbic acid, H-C6H7O2 is higher. When you're starting off, if you're doing a titration, your concentration of potassium sorbate will be higher, then you keep titrating it, it keeps reacting with the hydrochloric acid, you get to the half equivalence point where these two things are gonna have equal concentrations, then if you keep titrating it, well then you're gonna become more acidic and you're gonna have a higher concentration of the sorbic acid. And so one way to think about, I mean actually we underline that whole part, so concentration of sorbic acid is higher, that's the main thing that they're asking for. But the way to think about this soft drink is something, it might have not, obviously people aren't sitting there and titrating every soft drink, but you could kind of view this soft drink as, well it got to that point after a theoretical titration that got us past the half equivalence point and so therefore most of our, the things that we care about is in the form, is in this acid form versus the conjugate base, most of the sorbic acid is in its acid form. Or I guess you could say the other way, most of the sorbate has become the conjugate acid.
