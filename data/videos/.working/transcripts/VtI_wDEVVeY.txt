evaluate the following expression. When x is equal to seven, and they give us negative three x minus six. So wherever we see the x, that is now going to be equal to seven. So this is the same thing as negative three times seven, negative three times seven minus six. And negative three times seven, this part right over here is negative 21, and then we're gonna subtract six from that. Negative 21 minus six is equal to negative 27. Next one, evaluate the following expressions when x is equal to eight, negative 10 x minus nine. So this is going to be, when x is equal to eight, it's gonna be negative 10 times eight. Before where we saw an x, we now have an eight minus nine, minus nine. And this is going to be equal to negative 10 times eight is negative 80, and then we wanna subtract nine from that. So negative 80 minus nine, that is negative 89. And then one more, evaluate the following expression. It really should be expression. There's only one expression right over here. Expression, expression. When x is equal to 10, x is equal to 10. So it's eight times x plus 10. x is 10. So it's eight times 10, which is 80 plus 10, which is 90. So this is 80, 80 plus 10, which is equal to 90. And we're done.
