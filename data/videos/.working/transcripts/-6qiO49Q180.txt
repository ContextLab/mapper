What I hope to do in this video is give ourselves some practice at critically looking at how folks manipulate polynomials. And the reason why this is useful is because it's useful to be able to do this to yourself as you manipulate polynomials to say, wait, what did I exactly do there? Or a lot of times, if you're reading a math or a science book, they're gonna do some proof or something like that and they're gonna say, oh, well, you know, it's obviously from this step to this step and you're gonna try to follow it and you're just like, well, does that make sense? So it's a really useful muscle to be able to see, like does do these steps or whoever manipulated the polynomial, does it make sense to you? And especially if it's you, it's super useful to be able to find if there are errors and to correct them. It'll just give you a better critical eye for this type of thing. So let's just start with this one. We have four x minus three times x minus two squared. And it looks like this person over five steps tries to expand it out. And so what I encourage you to do, pause the video right now and see if they did it correctly. And if they didn't do it correctly, try to identify on what step they messed up. All right, so assuming you've had a go at it, let's do this together. So as we go from the first expression to the second, to step one, what do they do? Well, they just expanded out x minus two squared. X minus two squared is just x minus two times x minus two. They haven't done anything to the four x minus three yet. And what are they doing a step, so that seems correct. So in step two, it looks like they're just trying to multiply x minus two times x minus two. So you have x times x, which would be x squared. You have x times negative two, which would be negative two x. You have negative two times x, which would be negative two x. And then you have negative two times negative two, which would be positive four. So it looks like they multiplied this out correctly. So step two, we're still doing good. All right, now what are they doing step three? And this whole time, four x minus three, they haven't really touched it yet. So they're just trying to simplify it. And all they did is they added these two middle terms. Minus negative two x minus two x is gonna be negative four x. So this still looks correct. The x squared didn't change, the plus four didn't change. They just added these middle two terms. Now as we go to this next step four, well now they're trying to multiply, they're trying to multiply these two expressions. So they're doing some algebraic multiplication. So let's see if we can figure this out. So we have four x times, let me do this in a new color. I'm getting bored of that magenta. All right, so we have four x times x squared, which is indeed four x to the third power. Then you have four x times negative four x, which is gonna be negative 16 x squared. So they did that right. Then you have four x times four, which is gonna be 16 x, and they wrote that right over there. Then you're going to have negative three times x squared, which is negative three x squared. We see that right over there. Then you're going to have negative three times negative four x, which is going to be positive 12 x, and they wrote negative 12 x. So they forgot, they saw a negative, negative, but they still put a negative there. Negative three times negative four x is negative times negative, it's gonna be a positive, positive 12 x. So they made an error here, and then they said negative three times positive four, which is indeed negative 12. So this part is right. So the error, this thing should read positive, positive 12 x. So the error they made is in step four. Step four is the error, and then that ended up giving them the wrong answer here, because they did a minus 12 x. Instead of, if this was a negative 12 x, then negative 12 x plus 16 x got you this four x, but we know it's supposed to be plus 12 x. So it really should be, it really should be 28. This should be 28 x right over here, but they really messed up. If you take that error, they did this step right, but step four is where they actually made the error. So let's keep going. Let's give ourselves a little bit more practice at looking at ways to manipulate polynomials and see if they're valid. So here, this comes from an exercise on Khan Academy. Let's see which of these are valid identities. Which of these are valid statements? So this first one, two x plus y times four x, two x plus y times four x minus two y is all of this business right over here. Let's just multiply it out. Two x times four x is going to be eight x squared. Two x times negative two y is going to be negative, negative four x y. And then, let me switch colors, y times four x is going to be plus four x y. And then y times negative two y is going to be, is going to be minus two y squared. And so, let's see, these two, did I do that right? Let's see, two x, two x times negative two y is negative four x y. And then I had four x times y is positive four x y. So these two are going to cancel out. So this is already, this is looking shady. So all we're left with is eight x squared minus two y squared. If we factor two out, if we factor two out, it's going to be two times four x squared minus y squared. So this is not a true statement right over here. Now let's try this one. N plus two squared, n plus two squared minus n squared is equal to this. Well, what's n plus two squared? That's going to be n squared plus four n. It's going to be two n plus two n. It's going to be plus four n plus four. And then we're going to subtract out an n squared. These cancel. So we're going to have four n plus four, which is equal to four times n plus one. So this one right over here works out. This is a true, I guess, in the language of this question. It is a valid identity, where you could say it's a true statement. This equation is true. And then we have this last one right over here. And once again, let's see if we can multiply it out. Let me go down here into the black space. So if I have a times two a, that's going to be two a squared, and then a times one is going to be plus a. And then if I have b times two a, it's going to be plus two a b. And then finally, if I have b times one, it's going to be plus b. And then out here, we are subtracting a b. So over here, we're going to subtract a b. These characters are going to cancel out. And then we're left with two a squared plus a plus two a b. And it looks like they factor out an a, so let's see if we can factor out an a ourselves. So if we factor out an a, we're going to be left with, this first term is going to be two a. It's going to be two a. This right over here, if we factor out an a, is going to be plus one. And this, if we factor out an a, is going to be two b. And that's exactly what they wrote over here. They just wrote in a different order. A times two a, two a, plus two b, plus two b, plus one. Plus one. So this is legit. So hopefully that gave us some good practice, critically looking at whether people are making valid statements. And this is going to be the most useful to figure out if you are making valid statements. All right, hopefully you enjoyed that.
