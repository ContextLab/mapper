So we're told that h of x is equal to all of this business over here and they say the table for h is shown below. So they give us some x values and what the corresponding h of that x value is. So h of negative five is zero, h of negative four is 25 and so forth. Identify the exact x values where h of x is equal to zero. So pause this video and have a go at that. All right, so when does h of x equal zero? So we could see it equals zero right over here and right over there. So what are the x values when h of x equals zero? Well, it's x equals negative five and it is x equals one or we get another way to say it, h of negative five is equal to zero and h of one is equal to zero. All right, let's do the second part. Between which two consecutive x values from the table must another solution to h of x equals zero exist? So pause this video and have another go at it. All right, so one way to think about it is in order for, it doesn't always have to be the case that let's say this is a point right over here. This is some x value, let's call it x one, where we have some curve. I don't know what h actually looks like. So you could have some point right over here where h of x one is equal to zero, where before that point, you're going to have a positive value of h and after that point, you have a negative value of h. Now, so if you were to look at this, let's call this x zero and you would see that h of x zero is greater than zero, h of x zero is greater than zero and then this, let's call this x two and then you'd say h of x two is less than zero, then as long as you know that this is a continuous function and you know that because this is just traditional polynomial, you're not going to have any weird jumps or anything like that, you know, hey, if we had to go from a positive value for h to a negative value of h and it continues, we had to cross h of x equals zero, we had to cross the x intercept, or we had to cross the x-axis, I should say, at some point in between. Now, you don't have to always have that four zero, you could have a situation where you do something right like that, but if you have, between two consecutive points, that a continuous function is positive and then that continuous function becomes negative or vice versa, then you must have crossed zero. So let's think about where we have a change in sign, we have zero to positive, that's not quite a change in sign, we're still non-negative, so we're positive, positive, positive and then negative, so we went from a positive h of x to a negative h of x, a positive h of x to a negative h of x and that happened between x equals negative one and x equals zero. So between these two consecutive x values, negative one and zero from the table, a solution to h of x equals zero must exist. At some point in between here, we don't know exactly, in this example, our x one would sit right in between there, there's some x one where h of x one is equal to zero because we had to go from positive to negative. It was also the other way around, from negative to positive, and it's a continuous function, we'd also be able to make that same conclusion.
