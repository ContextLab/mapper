Goku wants to get over 9,000 comments on his YouTube videos. He gets the same number of comments for each cat video that he uploads, and he gets the same number of comments for each dog video that he uploads. That's somewhat amazing. You have the exact same number of comments for each cat video and the exact same number for each dog video. But we'll just assume what they're telling us. In the following inequality, C represents the number of cat videos, C for cat, and D represents the number of dog videos, D for dog. Dog videos that Goku should upload to achieve his goal. So 750 times the number of cat videos plus 450 times the number of dog videos needs to be greater than 9,000. According to the inequality, how many comments does each cat video get, and how many comments does each dog video get? So let's see if we understand what's going on in this inequality to answer their question. So he wants to get over 9,000 comments, and we see that right over here. He wants to get over 9,000 comments. So this we could view as the number of comments that he actually gets. And since we have some number times C, we could assume that we know that C is the number of cat videos, and so the number times C, that's the number of comments that he gets from cat videos. And on a per cat video basis, he's going to get 750 comments. Because if I say, hey, look, I have C cat videos, and on each of them I have exactly 750 comments, well, I'm going to have 750 times C comments on all of my cat videos combined. So each cat video gets 750 comments. And similarly, I can never say that, each dog video gets, well, this is the total number of comments from dog videos. You add all of this together, you get the total number of comments, which need to be greater than 9,000. Well, if the total from dog videos is 450D, that means he's getting 450 comments per dog video. 450 comments per video times the number of dog videos gets the total comments from dog videos. So he gets 450 comments per dog video. Can Goku achieve this goal by uploading eight cat videos and seven dog videos? So let's think about this. Eight cat videos, seven dog videos. So let's see, if we have 750, let me do those same colors. If we have 750 times eight, times eight, plus 450 times seven, is this greater than, I'll write it as a question mark because we don't know, is this going to be greater than 9,000? Well, we just have to evaluate this. What is this going to be? Let's see, 700 times eight is 5600. It's going to be 5600 plus another 50 times eight is 400. So 5600 plus 400 is 6,000. So this is 6,000 right over here. So that would be, if he has eight cat videos, he gets 750 comments per video. So he's going to have a total of 6,000 comments on all of the eight cat videos combined. And then 450 times seven, let's see, 400 times seven is 2800 plus another 350. That's going to be, what, 3150? Is that right? Let's see, that would be, let me make sure I do this right, 2800 plus 400 times seven is 2800. 850 times seven is 350. Yep, I think that is right. It all works out, 3150. So 6,000 plus 3150 is indeed greater than 9,000. It is indeed greater than 9,000. This over here is 9,150, which is indeed greater than 9,000. So yes, he can achieve his goal by uploading eight cat videos and seven dog videos.
