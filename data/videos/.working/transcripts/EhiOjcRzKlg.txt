Hi, I'm Sal, founder of the Khan Academy. And I'm Kim, Khan Academy's US History Fellow. And it being July, the month of our nation's birth, as well as an election year, kind of a not so exciting election year, we thought we would excite that we would spice things up a little bit by creating a crowdfunding campaign to sponsor American history and government content on Khan Academy. The goal is to answer all the questions you might have about our history and our government, anything from what's an executive order to how the Supreme Court works. But to make it happen, we need your support. It'll help you learn, but even more, it'll help your fellow citizens learn so that we can have a deeper, richer, and more spirited democracy. So help us make history at Khan Academy with our very first crowdfunding campaign to create education by the people for the people. So Kim, you've got a PhD in American history and you create and create a lot of our content. What are we going to do as part of this campaign? Well, I think what's exciting about what we're doing here is that this is going to be a easy to understand, completely nonpartisan way for people to learn more about our government and to become engaged in active citizens. Very exciting. We're looking to raise $300,000 by July 28th. And to put that in perspective, the content we're going to create is going to have more information than all of the political ads combined for a very small fraction of the cost. And shortly after that, we're going to start putting the content up that Kim and I and others create to answer all of your questions. You can also get some amazing Khan Academy swag and perks by backing us here on Indiegogo. We look forward to your support.
