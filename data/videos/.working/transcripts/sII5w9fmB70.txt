So the first question is, is there a reason why you do what you do? What inspired you to do this today? Well, the reason why I did it is, as the story goes, I started doing it for my cousins. It was neat for me even at the time back in 2005 when I started it. I had a day job. It was neat to be able to do something that could help my cousin in a tangible way. At first I started tutoring her live, but then I started recording the lectures because I had a bunch of cousins that I was tutoring and I wanted a way to scale up. It was kind of exciting for me back in 2006 when I made the first videos. I started tutoring my cousin in 2004, but in 2006 when I made the first videos, it was exciting this idea that I could make this content, that it would be able to reach my cousins and teach them now, and they'll always have it around to review. It could also teach the next generation of cousins or the next generation of kids. It could teach my future kids. I didn't have kids at the time. I have kids now. A big motivating factor is that at minimum it could just help the people that I care about. If I put it into the public domain and maybe it could help the broader people of a community of human beings, I guess is the one way to think about it. I guess on some degree that happened. I put them out there with the intent of at minimum helping just a few people, but a lot of people just started to notice it word of mouth and it began to spread. Then the more that that happened, I started getting feedback from people saying that it really helped them. Helped them pass exams, helped them get into colleges or pursue a certain career. That just became hugely fulfilling, more fulfilling than anything else that I've ever done in any role. It was a little bit of an addictive to keep making more videos. By 2009 it became so interesting that I decided to quit my day job and do it full time. We got funding last year in 2010 and it's just been a wild and positive ride ever since then. I think that makes it pretty obvious what inspired me, I guess. Number two, your online education beats the adage of no free lunch. How do you provide so much in education and all for free? Well, I guess there's two parts to that question. One is the rationale for making it free and two is how do we provide it and how can we afford to continue to provide it for free? The first, why should it be free is when I set out to make this content, actually what made it fun for me when I set out to make this content, there wasn't a profit motive that it was generally just to help my cousins and the few people who noticed it on YouTube. We had thought about it at different points in time, creating a profit model around it. Any profit model you put around it or any revenue model you put around it means restricting access to it. It bothered me. It took the fun out of what we were doing. It took the potential and the impact of what we were doing. The principle here is if we can make content that scales in multiple ways and it can reach many, many people if the incremental delivery cost for that extra person is close to zero. If that thing can continue to teach forever and if you believe as I believe that education really should be a fundamental human right, we would feel a little dirty charging for that content that we really feel the need to put it out there and have as many people as possible access. That's really what drives me and what drives the rest of our team. How do we think we can keep it free? There's multiple ways. One, we do accept donations on our site and people are donating and we're hoping that that can support us to some degree. Also, there are a lot of great foundations and well-wishers who are hoping to help improve global education. I think they're starting to realize that we are probably one of the most scalable, if not the most scalable way of doing it. Our expenses for producing Khan Academy and maintaining the site, they exist, but they're very small relative to the number of people we're reaching and the impact that we can have over a larger period of time. I think foundations are realizing that and I think hopefully they'll continue to support us as long as we continue to deliver good content and good software. That's my hope between foundations and people who found value at Khan Academy. If they want to donate it, if they have the means to donate it, we can get both of those going. I think that can keep us going for the foreseeable future. Number three, I am inspired to hear about your life achievements. There must be some truly inspiring factors that have pushed you to attain multiple degrees in different fields from renowned USA universities, which only some special individuals can achieve. What are those inspired PhD candidate, Adid, Ryan, Pu Chong? There must be. We're all kind of a product of our, to some degree, the product of our experiences. I would say my sister, who's three years older, had a fairly strong influence. She was always the good student. Because she was a good student and she was always three years ahead of her, by the time I got to a teacher's class, I think they had expectations. I think that's a powerful thing when people expect you to be a good student. It's not a false expectation. It's a genuine expectation based on the fact that you are Farrah's brother. I think that really helped me. My sister also, when she graduated from high school, this wasn't something that was done. No one really knew she had gone to any fancy universities, but she made the decision that she wanted to go to a good university. She navigated the whole thing herself, got in, even got the financial aid. We weren't well off at all. Frankly, my family was making below the poverty line at the time. She figured out how to get financial aid and all the rest. It allowed me to see how one can actually get opportunities for them. I think the US is pretty great that way. You can go to schools that are, at least on face value, very expensive. But if you apply and you're a good student and you have the right need, they will make it so that you can attend it. You end up with loans and all the rest, but it's worth it. I saw my sister do that. That had a big impact. It made me realize that it's possible. The other factors, I think I happened to know a few kids who motivated me. There was a kid ten years older than me in New Orleans, another Bengali kid, Thuhin Roy. By the time he graduated from high school, he had already finished his undergraduate degree as well. He'd done it at Tulane in New Orleans and then he went in and got a PhD. He's now gotten literally two PhDs and an MD, so he's quite an educated guy. When you see people like that, you meet them at a dinner party or family friends, it at least opens your mind that those type of things are possible. I remember one of my uncles was studying engineering at the University of New Orleans. This was when I was very young. I was seven or eight years old. I remember telling him that I wanted to study engineering too. He doesn't even remember doing this. I remember him telling me, if you study engineering, you should go to MIT. It's one of those things that just kind of enter in your head at a very young age. He doesn't even remember saying it. He just happened to say it on a whim, but it entered my head at a young age. To some degree, everything I did after that was kind of with that goal. Not even clear on how to fulfill it, but in the back of my mind, knowing that I wanted to do that. I think you can't underestimate that impact. In terms of the actual doing well, I think there's a lot to be said about really, when you're learning the material, especially the fundamental materials as you go through schooling, to not just focus on what you need to know for the next test, but to focus on really understanding it deeply. The people who understand it deeply, who really understand the core concepts really deeply, they end up finding more sophisticated things as they get into higher level mathematics and science. They tend to find that intuitive. The people who understand it superficially, they tend to find it gets harder and harder as they go further and further in their mathematical career. The biggest favor I think any student can do for themselves early on is just to make sure that whatever they're learning, whatever basic concepts they're learning, they understand it left, right, and center. I mean understand, not just be able to compute it, but actually intuitively know what it's representing and having almost a way to conceptualize and visualize those things. Number four, are you planning to open the online material to other languages to benefit globally? This is similar to Wikipedia. This is from Arthur Sam, Kuala Lumpur. Yes, the simple answer is yes. We are opening the materials. We're translating into 10 languages right now. We're captioning it in multiple languages. That's on a volunteer basis. Anyone can go and start captioning it to their language of their choice. Over the next few years, we are going to try to figure out ways to get more on the ground use cases in the developing world. There's definitely something high on our priority list. Number five, what is the most effective methodology to educate slow learners? Tabitha CC boy Penang. I'll tell you the most effective methodology to teach anyone. I'm not necessarily a big fan of calling. In our traditional education system, we tend to say, oh, those people are slower, those people are fast. I think those are sometimes just based on self-confidence or what gaps they already have in their knowledge. What I'd say to any learners to make sure that they have no gaps in their knowledge. Don't try to learn algebra until you've really mastered fractions and decimals and negative numbers. Don't try to master calculus until you've really mastered algebra. That's what we're trying to do at the Khan Academy. We're trying to have this mastery base. You don't move on until you've mastered one concept. It goes at your pace. If it takes you extra time to learn something deeply, that's okay. You don't have to rush it because the pace of the class is going on. Question number six, what are your favorite strong subjects and why? Bernard Gideon Lim Penang. If you had asked me in high school, I would have said, oh, by far, I would have said math and physics. But if you ask me now, I would say any of the things on the Khan Academy because my policy to myself, and I view this as a commitment to the people who use Khan Academy, is that I won't make a video unless I see why that subject is interesting. Because if I don't see it's interesting, there's no way that I'm going to be able to communicate that interest to other people. I'll tell you that my favorite subjects are the ones that I'm making videos on at the moment. When I focus on another subject, it'll be that subject. It's really all of the above. I hope I don't sound like I'm not answering the question, but I really don't have a single favorite subject. I actually find all of them fascinating. I can dive into biology and find that fascinating. I love physics. I love art history. I love history. I love any of the above, so I won't pick any favorites. Number seven, where do you see yourself in the next five to ten years? Is there something you would like to see achieved by then? Walter K. K. Tan, Perak. In the next five to ten years, I hope that Khan Academy actually turns into the... It's already doing this a little bit, but I hope it turns into the place where anyone can go to learn anything. They feel like they go there and not only is the information there, but there's a structure around it. Eventually, and we're not doing this yet, but we want to do this, there's a community at the Khan Academy that they can leverage to help their own development. Over five to ten years, I hope there's a model where we can start to give people the evidence they need that they know that subject, so that we can help reduce tuition costs because people will start to be able to maybe test out of some subjects or place into some subjects or get credit for what they already know. We have a lot on our plate. I couldn't have imagined where we are now a year ago, so it's hard for me to fully visualize five to ten years. What I'm hoping Khan Academy becomes with the long term is an institution that can serve as many people as possible and that is here to stay. That's not just a flash in the pan, not just a trend that people are excited about in the near term. Number eight, how do you recruit your online tutors trainers? What do you look for when you're planning to expand your team? Marco Suraj Johor. The first part of your answer is, as of right now, I am the only person on the site making videos. That was pretty easy to recruit them. I just had to convince myself. To answer your question, we are looking to expand the faculty, so to speak. Probably over the next few months, expect to see some new videos. We're being very careful though because I think the value of the Khan Academy is that when people go there, they know that they're going to get something interesting that's quality that they can trust, that is approachable. We don't want to just have any content up there. We want content that really does speak to students. We're being very careful who we bring on. We have a couple of people in the pipeline that I'm pretty excited about. If you think about who I'm looking for, we're looking for people who have deep subject mastery, deep love of the subject. They find beauty in what they are teaching. They are the type of people you want to have dinner with. They are down to earth. They are not condescending. They are not arrogant. They are fun. They can make fun of themselves. They're maybe a little bit witty and eccentric, all of the above. If we can find people like that, and they like making videos, and they can make a lot of videos, we find people like that, or you know people like that, so let us know. Number nine. In your opinion, what are some of the benefits of providing online tutoring as opposed to conventional tutoring? Amina Jharum Selayang. I don't think it's an either or proposition, but I think what online, especially the Khan Academy form of online tutoring, where it's videos and exercises, you can do it at your own pace, at your own time. You don't have the fear of someone judging you. You can review stuff that you forgot. You can essentially master things and progress at your own pace. What that said is there will be some times, and we're going to try to reduce those times as much as possible by making good content, but there are some times where the videos and the exercises just won't cut it. There's nothing better than having a live mentor or tutor who can take you past those fertile points. The ideal is actually a bit of both, where Khan Academy can do a lot of the first pass, blocking and tackling, handle a lot of the core material, and if someone has a teacher or tutor that can take them to the next level of depth, and really show an interest and mentor them on how they progress intellectually. Then number 10, how does Salman Khan, when he's not doing what he does, relax? Raslan Muhammad Petaling Jaya. I like to read books, and you might not be surprised that I like to read science fiction books especially. The other things I like to do maybe are a little bit...I love playing guitar. I'm not that great at it, so don't expect music videos from me, although we might see music videos from someone else in the not too far future. I really like being out of nature. Out here where I live in Northern California, there's actually a lot of good places to hike, and there's a lot of redwood forests and things, so when I really want to relax, there's really nothing better than going for a nice long walk through the woods. I think that's all the questions. Number one, I think I didn't refer to who asked the question. Number one was asked by Jeff Leong, Kuala Lumpur. Number two was asked by Bu Bur Singh, Sarambhan. Number three was Adid Rayan from Pu Chong. I think I asked, I told everyone else. Number four was asked by Arthur Sam, and I think I said all the other people who asked the questions. Thanks for the great questions, and I hope I answered them.
