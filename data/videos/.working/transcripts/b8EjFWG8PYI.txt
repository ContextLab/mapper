We're told there are 45 people going on a hike along a forest trail. They split themselves equally into teams of five to walk together. How many hiking teams will there be? So like always pause this video, try this on your own before we do this together. Okay, so let's first just think about what one team of hikers would look like. So that's five stick figures to represent the five people in one team. So this is one team and actually let me just, let me make a little columns here. So let me say that's team one and then let's see the total number of hikers. So right now we have a total of five hikers. Now let's add a second team. So we'll call that, now we have two teams and how many total hikers do we have? Five plus five, we now have 10 hikers. Let's keep doing this. We now could add a third team. And how many total hikers do we have? We now have a total of 15. And so this column right over here, this is total right over there. Let us keep going. We got another team. We now have four teams for total of 20 hikers. We can add a fifth team. Now if we add five to that, we have 25 hikers. Now we can add a sixth team. Gets us to 30 hikers. Notice I'm just adding five every time. Then we can get to a seventh team. And I'm just going to keep adding five hikers until I get to the 45. So now I get to 35. You might already see where this is going. Eight teams gets us to 40, not a coincidence. Eight times five is 40. And then we add five more. That's a ninth team. We get to 45 hikers. And that makes sense because nine times five is 45. And so the answer is how many hiking teams will there be nine? Another way to think about it is if you take 45 hikers and you divide them into teams of five, then you are going to get nine teams.
