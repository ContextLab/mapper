I'm Yuki and I work as the science content manager. I work on the videos, exercises, and articles in our sciences. So biology, chemistry, and physics. Failure is growth. I think is a motto I've seen upstairs. But yeah, for me, growth mindset is really all about like embracing failure and embracing just trying things even when you know it's not gonna work the first time and it might not even worth a second time. But you just keep trying and you might try adapt a little bit until you feel like you've really got it because you can you can do anything. An example I might give is in chemistry. So that's where my background is and that's arguably my expertise. It is my expertise. But I wouldn't say that's something that necessarily came that easily to me. I think it took me a really long time to develop good study habits. And one thing that was really hard for me from the beginning was like speaking up when I needed help. And so I learned pretty late in college that if I didn't get something, it really like, even though I might feel like I was gonna look dumb, like getting, like letting a teacher or a TA know right away that hey, I don't get this, can you explain this to me again? Very quickly was important. So going to office hours really being super vocal about when I don't know something so I could get help as soon as possible. And then also the other thing I figured out was the more practice I do on something the better I'll get at it. So even if I think I know something if I can't actually show that on paper, that doesn't mean anything. So trying to like also get lots of repetition and on things that I'm not that confident about. To really highlight when I don't know things was something I learned very late in college, but was super helpful to me once I figured that out, not just in chemistry, but in general. You
