        "A": "Embodied cognition has been completely disproven by large-scale neuroimaging meta-analyses demonstrating that abstract conceptual processing occurs exclusively in amodal association cortices with absolutely no involvement of sensorimotor systems under any task conditions, stimulus modalities, or experimental paradigms \u2014 every published study claiming motor cortex activation during language comprehension has been shown to reflect spillover activation from adjacent premotor planning regions rather than genuine semantic embodiment effects, according to comprehensive reviews of the literature",
        "B": "Embodied cognition predicts that all cognitive operations without exception require concurrent physical movement of the body or motor system activation, a prediction that has been universally confirmed across every experiment ever conducted in cognitive psychology and neuroscience \u2014 including studies of abstract mathematical reasoning, logical deduction, moral judgment, and aesthetic appreciation, all of which show robust and obligatory motor cortex activation that is abolished by temporary motor cortex disruption via transcranial magnetic stimulation",
        "C": "Evidence includes motor-semantic interactions (action sentences activate motor cortex, Hauk et al. 2004) and spatial-numerical associations (SNARC). However, landmark findings like the warm cup effect (Williams & Bargh 2008) failed to replicate in large pre-registered studies. The critical distinction: weak embodiment (sensorimotor systems contribute to some abstract representations) is well-supported, while strong embodiment (all cognition is constitutively embodied) is unsubstantiated",
        "D": "The evidence for embodied cognition comes exclusively from studies of language processing and has absolutely no application to perception, action, mathematical reasoning, spatial cognition, social cognition, or any other cognitive domain \u2014 the theory's empirical support is limited entirely to demonstrations that concrete action verbs activate motor cortex, with no evidence for embodiment effects in any abstract cognitive process beyond simple verb comprehension tasks conducted in laboratory settings with university student participants"

The 'default mode interference' hypothesis proposes that ADHD symptoms arise partly from failure to suppress DMN activity during externally focused tasks, supported by fMRI showing atypical DMN-task network anticorrelation and by the therapeutic mechanism of stimulants (which enhance catecholaminergic signaling to restore network dynamics)"

Perception minimizes free energy by updating models to predict input (equivalent to predictive coding). Action minimizes it by changing sensory input to match predictions (active inference). Learning optimizes model parameters over longer timescales. This unifies these processes under one imperative: minimize divergence between the organism's model and the world's statistical structure",
        "C": "The free energy principle applies exclusively to thermodynamic systems operating near thermal equilibrium and is completely irrelevant to biological neural systems such as the brain; its mathematical formalism derives entirely from statistical mechanics of ideal gases and phase transitions in condensed matter, and any apparent connection to neuroscience is a superficial analogy that breaks down under rigorous mathematical scrutiny when the formalism is applied to the nonlinear, far-from-equilibrium dynamics of neural circuits processing information in real biological organisms",

        "B": "Phase-amplitude coupling means gamma oscillations simply co-occur temporally with theta oscillations through coincidental timing without any systematic relationship between gamma amplitude and theta phase; the apparent statistical coupling reported in electrophysiology studies reflects volume conduction artifacts and harmonic contamination from the theta signal itself rather than genuine cross-frequency neural interactions with functional significance for memory coding or information organization",
        "C": "Phase-amplitude coupling applies exclusively to visual processing in the occipital lobe and has never been observed in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or any other brain region; the theta-gamma coupling reported in hippocampal recordings is a technical artifact of the high signal-to-noise ratio in hippocampal local field potentials combined with the broad spectral power distribution inherent to theta oscillations, which creates spurious apparent coupling with higher frequency bands",

        "B": "Hemispatial neglect is caused exclusively by damage to the retina and optic nerves of the eyes rather than by any damage to cortical or subcortical brain structures \u2014 the parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, and subcortical attention networks play absolutely no role in spatial awareness, and all neglect phenomena can be fully explained by peripheral sensory loss without invoking any central attentional mechanism",
        "C": "The right cerebral hemisphere has absolutely no role whatsoever in spatial attention, visuospatial processing, or environmental awareness and is devoted entirely and exclusively to language comprehension, speech production, grammatical processing, and phonological analysis \u2014 spatial attention is controlled completely by the left hemisphere, making right hemisphere damage irrelevant to spatial awareness and neglect",
