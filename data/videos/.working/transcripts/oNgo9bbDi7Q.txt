You'll hear the terms balanced forces and unbalanced forces a lot when you're dealing with physics. And what I want to do in this video is give you a bunch of scenarios and have you think about whether the forces in these scenarios are balanced or unbalanced. So let's start with a scenario where we have the ground. And then sitting on the ground, we have a rock. Now, the force of gravity is going to be pulling the rock downwards towards the center of the Earth. And it's going to be pulling it, that's essentially the weight of the rock. It's going to be pulling it downwards, let's say, with a force of 5 newtons, 5 newtons downwards. But then the rock is also being supported by the ground. The ground is keeping it from being plummeted downwards. So the ground is providing an upwards force, or normal force, in this situation. The ground is providing a normal force. I'll do it in the green. The ground is providing a normal force in this situation of 5 newtons. So these forces have the same magnitudes, but they're going in opposite directions. So that is the first scenario. Now let's think about another scenario. So I'll draw the rock again. So I'll draw that same rock. So now I will draw that same rock. We'll assume it's the same rock. The force of gravity is still downwards 5 newtons. And there's still a normal force, the ground supporting the rock, of 5 newtons upwards. 5 newtons upwards. And now there's some character who's trying to push the rock. So we have some character here. And he is trying to push the rock. And he's applying a force of 2 newtons to the right. But then there is a force of friction between the rock and the ground that is going to, and I'll do friction in orange, 2 newtons to the left. So that right over there is the force of friction, is going against that guy's pushing. Now let's do another scenario. Once again, a very similar scenario. So let's draw another scenario where I have a rock now. I have maybe the same rock. And here I have a 5 newton force downwards, force of gravity, like the rest of the scenarios. And I have the normal force, the rock is being supported by the ground, 5 newtons upwards. And this guy now here has been able to push a little bit harder. He's pushing a little bit harder. He really put his back into it. And now he's pushing with a force of 3 newtons to the right. And the force of friction is still 2 newtons to the left. So that right over there is the force of friction. Now let's do a couple more scenarios. Now let's just imagine that this is the ground. And then I have the rock. The rock is not resting on the ground. And so the only force I have acting on the rock right now is the force of gravity acting downwards. We're assuming we're not going to think too much about. Actually, let's think about it a little bit. Let's also put it. So I have the force of gravity. That's 5 newtons down. But I have some air resistance here. You could view it as a force of friction of the air. And let's say that that is 1 newton up. This is a force of friction. Or you could call it air resistance. As this thing bumps into all of the air particles as it is falling to the ground. And then the last scenario I'll draw the rock against, as that seems to be the theme for this video. The last scenario, that's the ground. The rock is resting on the ground. The rock is resting on the ground. And I have the force of gravity, 5 newtons downwards. So 5 newtons towards the center of the earth. The rock is being supported by the ground. 5 newtons upwards. And now this guy is pushing really hard. So this guy right over here is pushing really hard. And so he's applying, let's make that 4 newtons, in that direction. You have 2 newtons from the force of friction. I won't draw that just yet. And you also have another character right over here who's trying to keep this guy from pushing the block. So he's pushing in the other direction at 1 newton. So you have 2 newtons of the force of friction. You have this guy pushing 1 newton against this guy's motion to the left. So between this guy and the force of friction, you have 3 newtons. You have 3 newtons going in that direction. So now I'll let you think about which of these have an unbalanced force in them. Or which of them, another way to think about it, which of these have a net force going on? So let's look at the first scenario. We have a 5 newtons force of gravity acting towards the center of the earth. 5 newton normal force of the ground supporting the block. These have the same magnitude in the exact opposite direction. So they cancel out. These forces completely balance each other out. There is zero net force going on. There are no forces, the way I've drawn it, going on in the horizontal direction. So you have zero net force. These right here are balanced. Or I guess we would not consider this one of the scenarios where we see an unbalanced force. Let's go over here. Once again, this 5 newtons and that 5 newtons, they are balancing each other. And then in the horizontal direction, this guy's pushing of 2 newtons to the right is being completely balanced by the force of friction of 2 newtons to the left. And because they're balanced, you're going to have no net force. And actually, this block isn't going to accelerate. So once again, these are all balanced forces. Or there's no unbalanced or net force going on right over here. In this scenario, once again, in the vertical direction, these forces are balanced. The normal force in this scenario is balancing the force of gravity, keeping the rock from plummeting, from accelerating towards the center of the earth. And you do have two forces that are counteracting in the horizontal direction. This guy is pushing harder with 3 newtons. But the force of friction now is only 2 newtons to the left. So you do have a net force to the right. 3 newtons to the right, 2 newtons to the left, you have a net force of 1 newton to 1 newton to the right. Or you see it's right based on how I drew the vector. So you do have a net force, or another way of thinking about it, that this is a scenario where you have unbalanced forces, in particular, in the right-left direction. Now let's look at this over here. We only have forces the way I've described it, acting in this vertical direction. You have the force of gravity, 5 newtons downwards. You have a counteracting force, the force of air resistance, 1 newton upward. But they don't completely balance out. You still have a net force of 4 newtons downwards. And so this is an unbalanced situation. And finally, right over here, we're sitting on the ground in the vertical direction. Normal force, counteracting the force of gravity. Those are balanced. But then in the horizontal direction, this guy to the right, we have more force, 4 newtons, than what we have going to the left. The 3 newtons was this guy plus the force of friction. So in this situation, you do have a net force in the right-ward direction. Once again, a 1 newton force to the right, a 1 newton net force, this is a scenario where we have unbalanced forces.
