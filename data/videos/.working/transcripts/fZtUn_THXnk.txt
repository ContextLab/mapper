Toby is a farmer. He plants 12 rows of carrots in a field. Each row has six carrots. How many carrots did Toby plant? So let's try to visualize this thing. So they tell us each row has six carrots. Let's try to visualize a row. So that's one carrot. That's two carrots. That's three carrots. That's four carrots. That's five carrots. And that's six carrots. And I can even do, just so it looks nice, a little leafy part of the carrots. So this we can visualize these as carrots. So that's one row of carrots. They tell us each row has six carrots. Now, there are 12 of these. He plants 12 rows of carrots. Let me see if I can copy and paste this. So copy and paste. So that's two rows. Make sure I have enough space. Two rows. That's three rows. That's four rows. This is five rows. This is six rows. And actually, I can just copy and paste the whole thing. This is six rows. And you just need to double that to get to 12 rows. Let me do that. So copy and paste. There you go. So there's 12 rows right over here. And let's number this. So they tell us each row has six carrots. One, two, three, four, five, six. They tell us he plants a total of 12 rows. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. How many carrots did Toby plant? Well, you could do this exercise and then try to count all of these carrots. But that seems a little bit crazy. These are already a lot of carrots. And especially if these were even larger numbers, it would take you forever to count it. Luckily for us, we have multiplication as a tool that we can use. So if you have 12 rows and each of those rows have six, this is really 12 times six. You're going to have 12 rows. And each of those, you have six carrots. So you could say you have six carrots 12 times. So it's going to be 12 times six. If you remember your multiplication tables up to 12, you'll remember that 12 times six is 72. So he has 72, 72 carrots. Even if you only remember, well, I'll just leave it there. If you remember your multiplication tables, which you should, because that is one of the things in life that will have long-lasting benefits, 72 carrots.
