So we have three functions here. What I want to do together is think about whether each of these functions are even or odd. And just as a little bit of a reminder, for an even function, if you were to input negative x into the function, it's the same thing as inputting x, that f of negative x is the same thing as f of x. For an odd function, if you input negative x into the function, that's going to be the same thing as the negative of inputting x into the function. And then if it's neither, well then neither one of these are going to be true. So let's test this. So let's first look at h of x. And like always, pause the video and see if you can, if you can work through this before I do. So let's just see what happens if I try to evaluate h of negative x. So it's going to be negative 10 times negative x to the 11th power plus negative x to the 9th power minus negative x to the 3rd power plus 7 times negative x. Well, what is that going to be equal to? Well, negative x to the 11th power is going to be equal to the negative of x to the 11th power, because we have an odd exponent right over here. Let me just restate what I just said. So negative, let me just, so negative x to the 3rd, that's the same thing, that's the same thing as the negative of x to the 3rd. We know it's going to give you a negative value. Similarly, negative x to the 7th is going to be equal to the negative of x to the 7th. Try it out with some number here. This was negative 1, negative 1 to the 7th power, it's the same thing as negative, times 1 to the 7th power. So let me, so let me write that over here. So this is going to be negative x to the 11th power. This is going to be negative x to the 9th power. And here, when I'm writing it this way, we're going to do the exponents first and then put a negative in front of it. This is going to be, this is going to be negative of x to the 3rd power. And this is just, well this is just negative x. So if you have negative 10, times the negative of x to the 11th, negative times the negative is going to be a positive. So this is going to be positive 10 x to the 11th power, and then minus x to the 9th power. Minus x to the 9th power. And then you subtract a negative x to the 3rd, so that's going to be a positive x to the 3rd, and then this is going to be minus seven x. And notice, what we have right over here is similar to what we have up here, except all the signs are different. So this is the same thing as if I took a negative and I multiplied it by h of x. So this is negative h of x. If I took each of these and I multiplied it by a negative one, then I got what I just got here, which is h of negative x. So we just saw that h of negative x is equal to negative h of x. And so we know that this is an odd function. And one tell-tale signature for it is it's made up of a bunch of odd functions. We have an odd exponent over here. This is going to be an odd function if it was by itself. This is an odd function if it was by itself. This is an odd function if it was by itself. And so is that an odd function by itself? So if you add up a bunch of odd functions, you're going to get an odd function. All of these have odd exponents on them, which make them odd functions. So let's think about the f of x right over here. So f of negative x, well, negative seven. Well, negative x to the sixth power, you multiply negative six times, it's going to be a positive. So that's just going to be negative seven x to the sixth. And then plus three, well, negative x to the fourth power. Let me, I don't want to skip steps here. So this is negative x to the sixth power plus three times negative, negative x to the fourth power minus nine times negative x squared. And then we have plus eight. Well, a negative number to the sixth power is going to now be a positive number. So this is going to be equal to negative seven times the same thing as x to the sixth. Plus, well, negative x to the fourth, the same thing as x to the fourth. The negatives all cancel out. So you're going to have three x to the fourth. Then minus, negative x squared is the same thing as x squared. Negative three squared is the same thing as three squared, just giving you an example. So this could be negative nine x squared. The negatives here cancel out, plus eight. Well, notice this is the same thing as f of x. So we have f of negative x is equal to f of x. So f of x is even. And once again, this should not be a surprise because it's made up of a bunch of even functions all added together. Each of these are symmetric about the y-axis. So you add them all together, you're going to get an even function. It's made up of a bunch of terms that all have even degrees. So it's a sixth degree, fourth degree, second degree. You could do this as a zeroth degree right over there. Now let's think about g of x. G of x buried in here. And you might just be able to look at it and say, okay, look, this is an even function there. This is an even function. But this is an odd function. And this is an odd function. It has a third degree term and a first degree term. So it's a mixture of even and odd functions. So this is going to be neither even nor odd. And you could test that out. We can look at g of negative x is going to be equal to, well, negative x to the fourth is the same thing as x to the fourth. So it's going to be three x to the fourth. Negative x to the third is the negative of positive x to the third. So that's going to be a positive 10 x to the third. Actually, let me just write this. Let me write it all out. So negative x to the fourth minus 10 times negative x to the third power plus negative x squared minus negative x. So this is just x to the fourth. This is the negative of positive x to the third. This is the same thing as x squared. And then this, well, that's just negative x. So this is going to be three x to the fourth power. Negative 10 times the negative of x to the third is positive 10 x to the third power plus x squared. And then you subtract a negative plus x. So notice, this is neither g of x. It's definitely not g of x because we swapped the signs on the two odd-powered terms. We swapped the signs over here. But it's also not the negative of g of x. We've only swapped signs on a few of them. And that's because we've swapped signs on the odd ones, on the odd terms, not on the even terms. So this one right over here is neither even nor odd.
