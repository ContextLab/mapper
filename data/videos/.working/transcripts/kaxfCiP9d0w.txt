We're told carbon-14 is an element which loses exactly half of its mass every 5,730 years. The mass of a sample of carbon-14 can be modeled by a function m, which depends on its age, t, in years. We measure that the initial mass of a sample of carbon-14 is 741 grams. Write a function that models the mass of the carbon-14 sample remaining t years since the initial measurement. All right, so like always, pause the video and see if you can come up with this function m that is going to be a function of t, the years since the initial measurement. All right, let's work through it together. What I like to do is I always like to start up with a little bit of a table to get a sense of things. So let's think about t, how much time, how many years have passed since the initial measurement, and what the amount of mass we're going to have. Well, we know that the initial, we know that the initial mass of a sample of carbon-14 is 741 grams. So at t equals zero, our mass is 741. Now, what's another interesting t that we could think about? Well, we know every 5,730 years, we lose exactly half of our mass of carbon-14, every 5,730 years. So let's think about what happens when t is 5,730? Well, we're going to lose half of our mass, so we're going to multiply this times 1 half. So this is going to be 741 times 1 half. I'm not even going to calculate what that is right now. And then let's say we have another 5,730 years take place. So that's going to be, and I'm just going to write two times 5,730, I could calculate it, what's going to be 10,000, 11,460 or something like that. All right, but let's just go at two times 5,000, is it 10,000 plus 1,400, so 11,400 plus 60, yeah. So 11,460, but let's just leave it like this. Well, then it's going to be this times 1 half. So it's going to be 741 times 1 half times 1 half. So we're going to multiply by 1 half again. And so this is the same thing as 741 times 1 half squared. And then let's just think about, if we wait another 5,730 years, so three times 5,730, well then it's going to be 1 half times this, so it's going to be 741. This times 1 half is going to be 1 half to the third power. So you might notice a little bit of a pattern here. However many half-lives we have, we're going to raise 1 half to that power and then multiply it times our initial mass. This is 1 half-life has gone by, 2 half-lives, we have an exponent of 2, 3 half-lives, we multiply by 3, sorry, we multiply by 1 half, 3 times. So what's going to be a general way to express m of t? Well, m of t is going to be our initial value, 741 times, and you might already be identifying this as an exponential function, we're going to multiply times this number, which we could call our common ratio, as many half-lives have passed by. So how do we know how many half-lives have passed by? Well, we could take t and we can divide it by the half-life. And try to test this out, when t equals zero, it's going to be 1 half to the zero power, which is just 1 and we're just going to have 741. When t is equal to 5,730, this exponent is going to be 1, which we want it to be, we're just going to multiply our initial value by 1 half once. When this exponent is 2 times 5,730, well then the exponent is going to be 2, and we're going to multiply by 1 half twice, it's going to be 1 half to the second power. And it's going to work for everything in between. When we are a fraction of a half-life along, we're going to get a non-integer exponent, and that too will work out. And so this is our function, we are done. We have written our function m that models the mass of carbon-14 remaining t years since the initial measurement.
