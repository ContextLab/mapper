I'm here with Jeffrey Moore again. In the last video, we talked about how writing, it's kind of different things for different folks. You have writing as expression, that's for the writer. And then you have writing as something that might inform you or entertain you as a reader. And there, it's a product, something you're looking at. And we talked about a potential process. There are multiple ways of tackling it for the writer. But I guess, how does a reader look at the product or evaluate the product? This is an interesting situation. In particular, writing in the context of college writing, or what we often call the freshman writing requirement, there's actually a very large body of standards, if you will, around what constitutes good and effective writing in an academic context. And they carry over actually quite well to a business context. You can apply the model also to informal and creative writing, but it doesn't apply as well. So this is primarily, think about primarily in the context of essay writing. In that context, there are three traditions of value that readers seek in an effective essay. The first is logic. You actually make sense. You actually make sense. And logic tends to be about the world. So basically, what I want logic to do is to represent forces in the world and give me a map for avoiding the bad ones or mitigating them in some way and leveraging the good ones. And when you're using language in that context, it's actually a power tool. And so you have saws, and you have hammers, and you have stuff. You have nouns and verbs and modifiers. But basically, they're power tools, and they're designed to give you mastery over the world. That's what you want. And so logic is about, do I in fact believe the way you're representing the world, in fact, corresponds to the world? And an example of, I always like to use bad examples. So an example of bad logic would be, my cat enjoys drinking milk. Therefore, I should be president of the United States. That would be, yeah. There's a connection between your cat and milk and the presidency. I've read things like that. Yeah. Well, if you want to be president bad enough, anything would be a sign. Yes, so cause and effect is one whole domain of logic around cause and effect. There's a whole set of domains around categories. Does the cat belong in the category of pet or in the category of sex object? And you think, well, I suppose. I guess that's becoming more politically relevant now. But actually, I'd be fun to parse some political speeches with you, because I think they tend to be empty of actual logic. Well, they are because they're so good at the second one. So the second value cluster is around rhetoric. So if logic is about being aligned with the world as it is and understanding the forces in the world, rhetoric is aligning with the reader, with the audience. In writing, it's the reader. But in speaking, of course, it's the audience. And in video, we call it the audience. It's like connecting. It's connecting. It's connecting. And you're working backward from the values of the reader. So if the reader wants to hear something, a good rhetorician will figure out a way for the reader to hear that. Now, if I say politician instead of rhetorician, it seems almost synonymous. I see. And the political speech is primarily designed to excite the desire to vote. And so what I need to do is to make you believe in my speech that I am speaking your heart. And if I can speak your heart, then that's good. Now, the problem with voting is because you have to get a majority of votes, you have to create the illusion that you're speaking a majority of hearts. It's almost impossible to actually do that. Hence, you get the logic. And the more logic you put into the speech, the more likely you're going to alienate. I mean, my cat example was a little bit ridiculous. But an example of that, you hear this all the time in politics on both sides of the aisle, is how dare my opponents want to raise taxes? The taxes are your money. And how dare my opponents want to cut benefits? Those are your benefits. I say we can do both. You hear that all the time. You do. And basically, it's like, and when they get away from the pulpit, the thing was actually rather discouraging about the United States government right now, is even when they get away from the microphone, they don't give it up. So they believe. Well, I always say the best way to be a convincing salesperson is to believe it yourself. So they believe that they can reduce revenue and increase spending and nothing bad. And I forgot to talk, and they also will talk about how bad the deficit is. Right, exactly. They'll say those three things at the same time. Or even they'll retreat to a highly polarized position, but what they won't do is get real. So we're in the domain of rhetoric. We're not in the domain of logic. So you see these things like the people that had to make the promise that the pledge is no new taxes, no matter what. It's actually a rhetorical strategy, not a logical strategy. It doesn't have to do with the forces in the world. It has to do with aligning the interests. Right, the appealing of people values, the taxes are infringing on my rights, my personal property, et cetera. Now, rhetoric is incredibly important, because if you do not engage the values of your audience, they will not act in ways that are constructive to your strategic intent. So we shouldn't think of rhetoric as dishonest. Empty logic, rhetoric paired with empty logic is dishonest. But logic without rhetoric is often correct but ineffective. It's cold. It's like a computer. It's like a law. It's like a legal document. It's like most of the textbooks that you're eviscerating right now with this program. OK. Right? Not all of them, because some of them are appalling on all three theaters. So there's logic and there's rhetoric. And then there's the third one is grammar. So grammar is actually a set of conventions. When people say, I don't like writing, it's often because they had their nose rubbed in grammar. And they really didn't learn anything about logic and rhetoric. And so there was no power. So if logic is being true to the world and rhetoric is being true to the audience, what grammar is being true to is the linguistic tradition. Actually, you're being true to a set of conventions of the ruling class of your society at the time you're on Earth. So grammar. So you sound like you're a member of the ruling class. Exactly. That's what grammatical rules are designed to align you with the language conventions of the ruling class. And of course, colonial, one of the more offensive things about colonialism is that it takes the language of the ruling class of one country and seeks to impose it on the language habits of people in other countries. And there's a lot of obvious. I've had many people try to get me to stop saying y'all. Y'all. I refuse. I'm a rebel. Stay with me. And part of that, by the way, is y'all actually has a rhetorical effect in America, at least, which is very disarming and kind of you all. It's kind of like we all. We're all in this together. And we're not snooty. And we're kind of down to Earth. And we drive red pickup trucks and try to get along with people. Yes. So OK. I don't drive a pickup truck. Well, then you probably do. Well, then you're probably not an Alabama native. I'm thinking. We don't want to offend anyone in Alabama. Well, red pickup trucks are not offensive. I'm from Louisiana. And to us, Alabama was a perfectly fine place. Next door to the neighbors. OK. This West Coast prejudice stuff will get out of there. Yes. You have biases. You should visit Alabama. No, I'm actually taking offense now. OK, good. Keep working. You should visit Alabama. It's actually quite nice. I'm a tree hugger from Oregon. So I have my own sort of mossy problems. OK. There's three disciplines. And in fact, in the Roman times and in the medieval curriculum and the Renaissance curriculum, they were called the Trivium, which stands for three things, logic, rhetoric, and grammar. And so for thousands of years, these three value systems were taught. Your ability to cite things in Latin makes you part of the ruling class in my mind. You've just trumped me. You just seem smarter than me now. No, no, no, no, no. The ruling class of about the 18th century. OK, no. It's still. Isaac Newton wrote Principi in Latin, right? Exactly. Not so much writing in Latin these days as it was. Now, the other thing that makes this comp- so that's complicated enough because you say, well, is my writing logical? Is my writing rhetorical? Is my writing grammatical? That's one thing. But then the next thing you find about language, which is so fascinating, is if you start like, it's like working from atoms to molecules to tissues to organs to organisms. Language atomically, I mean, I guess you get down to letters. We normally start with words. So words is kind of like the base place you start with language. It's just, OK, I'm going to learn a bunch of things about words. And you learn about nouns. You learn about verbs. You learn about modifiers and conjunctions. And these help you kind of the building blocks of language. And then you use them to write sentences. And one of the things you discover fairly early on in life is you can know everything about all the words and still write bad sentences. So what that means is there's an emergent property. As you move up a layer in the system's hierarchy from the word to the sentence, a bunch of properties appear that were not present at the lower level. Just like hydrogen to gas, oxygen to gas, you put them together, you get water. Who knew it was wet? And heavy. It's like, who knew? So emergent properties. So there's stuff that happens at the sentence level that you would not detect by just a bag of words. The same thing happens when you go from sentences to paragraphs. So when you put sentences together in a paragraph, all of a sudden there's a set of relationships that the reader is expecting or looking to engage with that you could write perfect sentences and write horrible paragraphs. The last one is from the paragraph to the essay. That one actually isn't as hard. If you can write good paragraphs, you're going to come pretty close to having most of the values of the essay. But there are some new things that happen at the essay level with introductions and conclusions in particular that you don't have at the paragraph level. So now you've got a 3 by 4 matrix. See that? I inadvertently drew a 4 by 3. That's fine. It's perfect. You got it right there. So now if you would just draw that. This becomes an interesting thing. So if you're really saying, I want to master the college writing requirement from the point of view of the product, meaning I need to create a college level product, or if I'm in business, I need to create a board level product, or I'm trying to create a marketing requirements document, or I'm trying to create a functional specification, or I'm going to write a manual for teaching people how to use something. If you're doing any technical writing, academic writing, business writing, marketing, communication writing, this is the matrix. These 12 squares are the magic squares. They are the 12 squares where you say, in each one of those squares, there's a set of values, or there's a set of attributes that make for good writing. Or conversely, if you did not meet those standards, you would make for bad writing. And so all of a sudden, it became an interesting question when we were teaching writing to realize, you know, not every writer is equally good or equally bad at all 12 squares. And so it became the first way we used this was actually as a diagnostic. We said, well, let's just look at a large sample of your writing and let's go through and assess it against these 12 squares. So if I look at your vocabulary, so are you able to discriminate with words from the point of view of getting very precise about the forces you're talking about? That's logic. Right. Logic, right. Precision. Are you able to pick words that are apt for the situation? So are they the right tone? Do they have the right nuances? That's rhetoric. The word apt was very apt. Yeah. Congratulations. There we go. And then thirdly, can you spell words correctly? And can you hyphenate them correctly at the end of a line? That would be word grammar. Right. And then you go up to the sentence level. And you say, OK, now sentence logics. Well, can you put the subject and the verb together? Do they make sense? Right. Are we connecting? Is the claim, which is usually in the verb phrase, fitting the topic, which is usually in the noun phrase or the subject? And so sentence logic. And then again, sentence rhetoric. Can you do short sentences combined with long sentences? Can you begin a sentence with an ad? Although I'm thinking this. It's aesthetics. It's emotive. I mean, it's still the apt appropriate kind of continues. It is. Often this is called style. And style maketh the man. People have their own styles. But readers also expect different styles in different situations. And so they expect a very curt style when they're looking at a stop sign or some warning sign. And they expect a more elaborate style. Please try to slow down as you approach this intersection. Might not be good. And conversely, if you're proposing marriage, wanna is probably not the right style. So therefore, style and sentences. And then sentence grammar and subject verb agreement, comma, splicing, and all the kinds of things. That stuff. That's kind of the core grammar that most people associate. It is. And I have to say it's probably one of the least. It's one of the most important squares in the point of view of superficial creating an impression. It's a little bit like table manners. The truth is table manners do not affect your ability to feed yourself. But people do judge you on your table manners. They judge you on your sentence grammar too. But it's a ruling class. I mean, literally. That's what I've always found fascinating. Out of all the standardized tests, the one that emphasizes grammar the most is the GMAT for business school. Because they recognize if you wanna, if you wanna, they always say, like, address for the job you want. That's exactly what grammar is. Grammar is the dressing that you put on your language. So being well-dressed doesn't mean you have, you could still be an empty suit, but the tie is done very well. You could be grammatically correct and be completely empty of any meaning or emotion or anything. Many of us have had teachers of that nature, but we won't go there. So then you go up to the next, well, the wonderful thing, by the way, obviously both you and I had at some point in our lives, you get a handful of teachers in your life that just transform you. Absolutely. And then the other ones don't matter. So, okay, so we go to the paragraph level and then an essay level. So at the paragraph level, the logic is more about, I'm building an argument about how things work in the world. Does it hold together? Claims, evidence, warrants, things like that. This is where the logic starts to really build. It does. Now you're really building a model of the world, is what you're doing with that logic. And the rhetoric has to do with, can I take you through a set of generalizations and specifically, can I go back and forth between examples and abstract? If I stay too abstract too long, I'll lose you. If I stay too concrete too long, you won't get the idea. And paragraph grammar, there's actually very little in paragraph grammar, there's just a few conventions. And then you go to the highest level, which is the essay itself. And at the logic level, this is where you say, I have a thesis and then I have component arguments that support the thesis, how does that all build? On the rhetoric side, it's I have an introduction, I have a body and I have a conclusion, how does that all flow? And then on the grammar side. That's interesting. I like how you're differentiating between thesis and introduction. The thesis is like, what's the whole point? What's the argument I'm making? What do I wanna, this is what I'm gonna convince you. Well, introduction is like, let me gently bring you into this nice feeling so you like me, so that you wanna read the rest of it. And so you tee up, the introduction is to tee up the thesis. And it only needs to be as long as you think it needs to get the reader or audience from wherever they are when you think you're gonna encounter them to be prepared to hear your thesis. And so that's the journey. And introduction means it's Latin, it'll lead in. So that's kind of what it's for. In conclusion's the opposite. Once again, fancy Latin. Yeah, there you go. Reinforcing your memory. Well, you know, if you had three years of Latin, I gotta use it somewhere. And then the back end of that is conclusion, which is so what? Conclusion is for the, when you were talking with the rhetoric or the logic? Yeah, it's rhetoric. Basically, it's the actionability. So after I've proved my thesis to the best of my ability, let's suppose you say, okay, Jeffrey, I grant your thesis, but so what? Why do I care? What should I do? So that's interesting, because if you were all perfect logicians, if we were like computer programs, the thesis is like, this is what I'm gonna prove. And if I'm doing a math proof, once I make the arguments, another mathematician will say, oh yeah, you've proven it. You're done, I agree with you. And by the way, no introduction and no conclusion necessary, right? Just argument, just the body. I don't have to say how wonderful the world would be if Pythagorean theorem was true and therefore, but if I'm trying to emote something, I should conclude and say, wasn't that amazing? Yes. Well, if you're teaching, introduction and conclusion is critical for teaching. That's why often great programmers are bad teachers, because they just don't see the need for either the introduction or the conclusion. And then the grammar stuff is around publishing. It's around the conventions of publishing, whatever. So you can kind of see this is a place where you have this ability to kind of fill in the blanks and you can assess yourself. If you're in a peer review with other students, you can say, well, let's look at the, the teacher can say, just look at the box on sentence style today. Just give Sal and Jeffrey feedback on their sentence style today. So it was a way of organizing and the curriculum and organizing class experiences. And therefore, when the teacher reviewed an essay, they didn't have to grade every box all the time. This is very cool, the Hergal. You have me thinking about things in new ways. That's the object.
