What we want to do is find the derivative of this g of x. And at first it could look intimidating. We have a sine of x here, we have a cosine of x. We have this crazy expression here. We have a pi over a cube root of x. We're squaring the whole thing. And at first it might seem intimidating. But as we'll see in this video, we can actually do this with the tools already in our toolkit. Using our existing derivative properties, using what we know about the power rule, which tells us that the derivative with respect to x of x to the n is equal to n times x to the n minus one. We've seen that multiple times. We also need to use the fact that the derivative of cosine of x is equal to negative sine of x. And the other way around, the derivative with respect to x of sine of x is equal to positive cosine of x. So using just that, we can actually evaluate this, or evaluate g prime of x. So pause the video and see if you can do it. So probably the most intimidating part of this, because we know the derivative of sine of x and cosine of x, is this expression here. And we can just rewrite this, or simplify it a little bit, so it takes a form that you might be a little bit more familiar with. So, actually let me just do this on the side here. So pi, pi over the cube root of x squared. Well that's the same thing. This is equal to pi squared over the cube root of x squared. This is just exponent properties that we're dealing with. And so this is the same thing. We're gonna take x to the 1 3rd power and then raise that to the 2nd power. So this is equal to pi squared over, let me write it this way, I'm not gonna skip any steps, because this is a good review of exponent properties, x to the 1 3rd squared, which is the same thing as pi squared over x to the 2 3rd power, which is the same thing as pi squared times x to the negative 2 3rd power. So when you write it like this, it starts to get into a form, you're like, oh, I can see how the power rule could apply there. So this thing is just pi squared times x to the negative 2 3rd power. So actually let me delete this. So this thing can be rewritten, this thing can be rewritten as pi squared times x to the negative 2 3rd power. So now let's take the derivative of each of these pieces of this expression. So we're gonna take, we wanna evaluate what g prime of x is. So g prime of x is going to be equal to, you could view it as a derivative with respect to x of seven sine of x. So we could take, let's do the derivative operator on both sides here, just to make it clear what we're doing. So we're gonna apply it there, we're gonna apply it there, and we're going to apply it there. So this derivative, this is the same thing as this is going to be seven times the derivative of sine of x. So this is just going to be seven times cosine of x. This one over here, this is going to be three, or we're subtracting, so it's gonna be this minus, we can bring the constant out that we're multiplying the expression by, and the derivative of cosine of x, so it's minus three times the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. Negative sine of x. And then finally, here in the yellow, we just apply the power rule. So we have the negative 2 thirds, actually let's not forget this minus sign, I'm gonna write it out here. And so you have the negative 2 thirds, you multiply the exponent times the coefficient, it might look confusing, pi squared, but that's just a number. So it's gonna be negative, and then you have negative 2 thirds times pi squared, times pi squared, times x to the negative 2 thirds minus one power. Negative 2 thirds minus one power. So what is this going to be? So we get g prime of x is equal to, is equal to seven cosine of x. And let's see, we have a negative three times a negative sine of x. So that's a positive three sine of x. And then we're subtracting, but then this is going to be a negative, so that's gonna be a positive. So we could say plus two pi squared over three, two pi squared over three, that's that part there, times x to the, so negative 2 thirds minus one, we could say negative one and 2 thirds, or we could say negative 5 thirds power. Negative 5 thirds power. And there you have it. We were able to tackle this thing that looked a little bit hairy, but all we had to use was the power rule and what we knew to be the derivatives of sine and cosine.
