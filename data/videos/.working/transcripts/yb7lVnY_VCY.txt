Tommy is studying for final exams this weekend. He will spend 1 fifth of the weekend studying. What fraction of the weekend will he spend studying for each of his four subjects if he spends the same amount of time studying for each subject? So the total amount of time he's going to spend studying this weekend is 1 fifth of the weekend. And he has to divide that into four equal sections, and he's going to spend that much time on each subject. So he's going to divide this by 4. Now we've already seen that dividing by a number is the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal. You might say, well, what's the reciprocal of 4? You just have to remind yourself that 4 is the same thing as 4 over 1. So 1 fifth divided by 4 over 1 is the same thing as 1 fifth times 1 fourth. And you could also view this as 1 fourth of 1 fifth, or 1 fifth of 1 fourth either way. But here we multiply our numerators to get 1. And then we multiply our denominators. 4 times 5 is 20. So you get 1 20th of the weekend we'll be spent studying for each subject. Now let's also try to think about this visually. Let's imagine that this is his entire weekend, and I've divided it into five equal sections. And so we already know that the total amount of his weekend spent studying is 1 fifth. So that's the total amount studying for the weekend is 1 fifth. Now he has to divide this into four equal sections. So let's do that. He's got four subjects, and he's going to spend the same amount of time on each of the four subjects. So he's going to divide this into four equal sections. So how much time does he spend on one subject? Well, on each subject, that would be this layer that I'm doing in yellow right over here. And what is that? Well, that's 1 over how many equal sections are there of that size in the weekend? Well, I've just drawn out the grid. You had five rows, and now you have four columns. So five rows times four columns, you have 20 equal sections. So once again, looking at it visually, he's spending 1 20th of his weekend on each of the four subjects. And then if you do this for four subjects, that means that in his whole weekend, 1 fifth will be spent studying. But the question that they're asking, he's spending 1 20th of the weekend on each subject.
