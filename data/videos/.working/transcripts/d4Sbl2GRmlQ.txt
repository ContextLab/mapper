So we're asked to pick any three pairs of corresponding input and output values of the following function and fill the table accordingly. And if necessary, round our answers to the nearest 0.1. And our function is defined as if I input a t, what I'm going to output, f of t, is going to be negative two times my input, negative two times t plus three. And so we can just pick three arbitrary t's and input them into our function and see what the function spits out. Well, we could go picking some really easy t's to compute. So for example, if t is equal to zero, then f of t, we could do this in our head, but it would be negative two times zero plus three. Well, negative two times zero is just going to be zero plus three is just going to be three. If t is one, well then f of t is going to be negative two times one, I'll write it in parentheses, plus three. Well, negative two times one is negative two plus three is one. So this is one. And just for kicks, we could even put a negative one here. And once again, I could have put in, crazier numbers, I could have put in 2.30789, but that would just be more computation. Might as well pick some easy numbers. We're just trying to get a feel for this function. Depending on what I input, what do I output? And I'm allowed to pick my inputs. So if it's negative one, it's going to be negative two. So t is now negative one plus three. Plus three. So negative two times negative one is positive two plus three is five. It's going to be positive five. Let's do a few more of these. So this says, choose any three points on the following graph of y is equal to g of x and fill the table so each column represents a point. If necessary, round your answer and your zero point five. So once again, we could see, oh, there's a bunch of interesting points here. If x is equal to zero, what is g of x? This is y is equal to g of x. We see g of x is equal to negative one. Actually, let me make this a little bit smaller so that we can see it all on one screen. So there we go. So now we should be able to see it a little bit easier. So if x is zero, and once again, I'm just picking zero because it's easy to see that when x is zero, y is equal to negative one. And y is equal to g of x. So g of zero is negative one. See that right from the graph? Let's see some other points. So we have this point right over here. When x is negative one, y, which is equal to g of x, is equal to two. The point one comma two is on this line. When x is one, y is two. And y is equal to g of x. So g of one is two. All right, let's pick another one here. Let's see, when x is one, y is negative four. When x is, sorry, this was negative one right over here. When x is negative one, y is equal to two. And when x is positive one, y would be equal to negative four. And actually, these are the exact same numbers that I used last time for the inputs. Let's just see that you don't have to, I could use these numbers, but I could pick different numbers. I could say, let's see, this number, this point over here is interesting because it looks like both the x and y coordinates are integers. So if x is negative three, y is eight. So if x is negative three, y is eight. So once again, you should try to pick some values where you can clearly see what the corresponding x and y coordinates are of that line. But any of those would be valid pairs for a given input. What's g of x going to actually be?
