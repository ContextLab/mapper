During the dehydration experiment, ethane gas and unreacted ethanol passed through the tube into the water. The ethane was quantitatively collected as a gas, but the unreacted ethanol was not. Explain this observation in terms of the intermolecular forces between water and each of the two gases. And just to be clear what they're talking about, we can go to the original setup that they gave us at the beginning of this problem. So what they're saying is, through this, once they warm up the react, this, the catalyst and the ethanol in here, some of that ethanol gets converted into ethane, but not all of it does. In fact, part of this experiment we saw that we don't have a perfect, we have a 60 point something percent yield. And so you have a combination of ethanol and ethane gas going through this tube, it cools down, then it goes through this water, and they're saying it looks like we're only seeing, or we're primarily seeing the ethane gas here, how come we're not seeing the ethanol gas? And the reason, and I'll just paraphrase it right now, and then I'll write it down, is that the ethanol gas is much more dissolvable in the water, because ethanol is a polar molecule, water is a polar solvent, so it's going to dissolve much better in water than the ethane, which isn't a polar molecule. So let me write this down. So the ethane will kind of bubble through, while the ethanol can actually dissolve. So let's write this down. So, whoops, I'm having trouble, all right, there you go. So explain this observation in terms of intermolecular forces between water and each of the two gases. So we could write ethanol, ethanol is polar, is polar, polar, so it dissolves in water much better than, than ethane, than, than ethane, which is non, non-polar. And so we could say something like, so ethanol, ethanol and water, and water will have hydrogen bonds, will have hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds, you could even diagram it out if you like. The ethanol is right over here, so you have your oxygen, and then you have your hydrogen, and then you have your C2H5. This side over here, this is going to be partially negative. This is going to be partially positive. This is going to, oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, the difference is less than between oxygen and hydrogen, but this is also going to be partially positive, maybe not as partially positive, it's on this side right over here. And so when you have water molecules, so if this is a water molecule, right over here, where this is partially positive charges, partially negative charges, you're going to have the hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen, hydrogen bonds. So the ethanol is going to dissolve much better. The ethene isn't polar, and will only have induced dipole forces acting on it. So let me write this. Ethene, ethene is not polar, is not polar, and so, or I could say, so will only have induced dipole interactions. Induced, dipole, and maybe, well, I could say dipole, because the water is polar, and even though ethene is a symmetric molecule and has that double bond, it has no net polarity. There are parts of the ethene molecule that are going to be a little bit more negative than others, in particular when you look at the carbons over here, they're a little bit more electronegative than the hydrogens. And so, ethene is not polar, so it'll only have induced dipole, or I guess we could also say just dipole interactions, interactions, interactions with polar water. Polar water. And so this is why, so this is why ethene won't dissolve as well. Ethene won't dissolve as well, and bubbles through. And bubbles through. Ethanol dissolves, ethene bubbles through, because it's not, it doesn't have strong interactions with the water.
