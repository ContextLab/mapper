      "options": {
        "A": "Light traveled significantly faster in the early universe when the matter density was much lower and there was less gravitational drag on photons from intervening mass concentrations \u2014 as the universe aged and structure formed, increasing gravity progressively slowed photons to their current speed of $c$, so early photons covered far more distance per unit time than photons emitted today",
        "B": "The measurement is fundamentally incorrect \u2014 the observable universe is actually only 27.6 billion light-years across, corresponding to twice the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light, and all claims of a larger diameter result from confusing comoving coordinates with proper distances in an expanding Robertson-Walker metric",

      "options": {
        "A": "In general relativity, light follows geodesics through curved spacetime \u2014 mass curves both space AND time, and both curvatures contribute to the deflection. Newtonian gravity, treating light as particles in flat space subject only to gravitational acceleration, captures only the spatial curvature component, yielding half the correct value",
        "B": "Einstein's general theory of relativity includes the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$, which represents dark energy and provides an additional attractive force on photons that Newton's gravitational theory completely lacks \u2014 this extra force contributes precisely the additional deflection angle needed to match the observed factor-of-two discrepancy, and it explains why the bending effect is stronger near galaxies with higher local dark energy density",

        "B": "The \u03ba-mechanism (opacity valve) \u2014 in a specific ionization zone (primarily He II \u2192 He III), compression increases opacity, trapping radiation and heating the gas, which drives expansion. Upon expansion, the gas cools, opacity drops, radiation escapes, and the star contracts again, creating a self-sustaining oscillation cycle",

      "options": {
        "A": "The energy you expend lifting the book is converted entirely into thermal energy through friction with the surrounding air molecules. As you raise the book, it collides with billions of air molecules at each instant, transferring kinetic energy to them through elastic and inelastic collisions. This energy dissipation through atmospheric drag accounts for the work done against gravity and explains why you must continuously apply force throughout the lifting motion",
        "B": "The energy is absorbed directly into the book's molecular structure, strengthening the chemical bonds between its constituent atoms and molecules. As the book gains altitude, the work done by your muscles is stored in the interatomic potential energy wells of the paper, ink, and binding materials, making these bonds slightly stronger and the material slightly more rigid. This molecular energy storage explains why dropped books sometimes deform upon impact \u2014 the stored bond energy is released catastrophically",
        "C": "The energy simply disappears from the system because the conservation of energy law only applies rigorously in perfectly isolated systems with no external forces acting upon them. Since your hand is an external force doing work on the book, the system is open and energy conservation does not apply. The work you perform is dissipated into the environment through gravitational radiation and cannot be recovered by any physical process",
        "D": "It is stored as gravitational potential energy in the book-Earth system (E = mgh). If the book later falls, this stored energy converts to kinetic energy. The energy is a property of the configuration \u2014 the relative position of the book within Earth's gravitational field \u2014 not a property of the book alone"

The faster-moving lower surface experiences reduced static pressure relative to the slower upper surface, generating a net downward aerodynamic force that supplements gravitational acceleration during the descent phase and creates the observed speed increase at the lowest point of each swing cycle",

As it ascends, kinetic energy converts back to potential energy (decreasing speed). Total mechanical energy is conserved throughout \u2014 the pendulum continuously trades height for speed, with maximum kinetic energy at the lowest point and maximum potential energy at the turning points",

        "D": "Gravity exerts a downward force only during the descending portion of each swing, shutting off entirely during the ascending phase due to the bob's upward inertia temporarily canceling gravitational acceleration. This asymmetric gravitational forcing means the pendulum receives a net impulse on each downswing that accelerates it through the bottom of the arc, while the ascending half proceeds purely on the bob's stored kinetic energy without any gravitational influence until the bob momentarily stops and gravity re-engages for the next downswing"

        "A": "Touching the string at its midpoint increases the tension in both halves of the string by a factor of two, because the musician's finger acts as a new fixed point that effectively doubles the restoring force in each half-length segment. Since the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string is proportional to the square root of the tension (f \u221d \u221aT), doubling the tension raises the pitch by a factor of \u221a2, which is approximately a perfect fifth rather than an octave \u2014 but perceptual effects make it sound like an octave to most listeners",
        "B": "The musician's finger transfers body heat directly into the guitar string at the contact point, locally raising the string's temperature and therefore increasing the speed of transverse waves propagating through that segment. Since wave speed determines frequency for a fixed wavelength, the heated section transmits waves at higher frequency, and the overall pitch of the string increases by an amount proportional to the temperature difference between the finger and the string's ambient temperature",
        "C": "Touching the midpoint creates a node there, suppressing the fundamental mode (which has an antinode at the midpoint) and selecting the second harmonic \u2014 a standing wave with half the wavelength and double the frequency. Only harmonics that naturally have a node at the touch point survive, while all others are damped",
        "D": "The string becomes effectively divided into two independent half-length strings by the musician's touch, each vibrating at its own fundamental frequency. A string half the original length naturally produces a note one octave higher because frequency is inversely proportional to length (f = v/2L). This is identical to the physics of fretting a guitar \u2014 shortening the vibrating length raises the pitch \u2014 and the harmonic technique simply achieves the same length reduction without firmly pressing the string against the fretboard"

      "options": {
        "A": "The ball's inertia is temporarily stored as elastic potential energy in the stretched string during circular motion, and when the string is released, this stored energy is redirected outward along the string's final orientation. The string acts as a mechanical energy reservoir that accumulates kinetic energy through continuous deformation, and upon release, this energy converts back into directed linear motion along the radial direction that the string was pointing at the instant of release, which observers mistakenly perceive as tangential motion due to the rapid rotation",
        "B": "Air resistance acting on the ball during circular motion creates an aerodynamic drag force that is always directed opposite to the ball's velocity vector. When the string is released, this accumulated drag effect curves the ball's initial radially-outward trajectory into a tangential path over the first few milliseconds after release. The transition from radial to tangential motion occurs so quickly that it appears instantaneous, but high-speed photography reveals the brief curved path during which aerodynamic forces redirect the ball from its natural radial escape direction",
        "C": "The ball continues along a spiral path for several rotations after release due to residual angular momentum stored in the spinning mass",
        "D": "During circular motion, the ball's instantaneous velocity is always tangent to the circle. The string provides centripetal force that continuously redirects this velocity inward.

Sound wavelengths (centimeters to meters) are comparable to doorways and walls, producing significant diffraction. Visible light wavelengths (~400\u2013700 nm) are millions of times smaller than everyday obstacles, so light diffraction is negligible at that scale \u2014 though it does occur with appropriately tiny apertures",

This persistent temperature differential explains why metal consistently feels colder to the touch even after prolonged equilibration time",

The vacuum-glass interface acts as a perfect reflector at all angles of incidence because electromagnetic radiation cannot propagate from vacuum into a denser medium, confining the light to the hollow channel through fundamental electromagnetic boundary conditions that prohibit outward energy flow",
        "B": "Individual silicon dioxide molecules along the fiber absorb incoming photons and then re-emit them in the forward direction through a process of stimulated fluorescence, creating a chain-reaction relay mechanism analogous to a sequence of miniature amplifiers. Each molecular absorption-emission cycle preserves the photon's original wavelength and phase information while redirecting its propagation direction along the fiber axis, enabling signal transmission over hundreds of kilometers without conventional optical waveguiding",
        "C": "Total internal reflection: when light inside the higher-refractive-index glass core strikes the boundary with the lower-index cladding at an angle beyond the critical angle, 100% of the light reflects back into the core. By engineering the core and cladding refractive indices, light entering at appropriate angles bounces repeatedly along the fiber without escaping",
        "D": "The fiber functions as a continuous converging lens due to the natural curvature of its cylindrical geometry, continuously refocusing any diverging light rays back toward the central axis through graded-index refraction. This self-focusing property means that light entering at any angle within the acceptance cone is perpetually redirected toward the fiber's center by the lens-like action of the curved glass surface, preventing escape without requiring any reflection mechanism"

Exposure to surface-level solar radiation causes immediate and irreversible photochemical damage to their visual and neural tissues, overwhelming the organisms' negligible photoprotective mechanisms and triggering a cascade of oxidative stress that rapidly proves fatal within minutes of surface exposure",

The osmotic shock of transitioning between these radically different chemical environments causes rapid cellular lysis and organ failure as membrane transport proteins malfunction in the unfamiliar ionic environment",
        "C": "The extreme temperature difference between the near-freezing deep ocean (typically 1-4\u00b0C at abyssal depths) and the comparatively warm surface waters (15-25\u00b0C in temperate latitudes) causes immediate organ failure through thermal shock. Deep-sea organisms' enzyme systems and cellular membranes are adapted to function exclusively within a narrow low-temperature range, and exposure to temperatures even 10\u00b0C above their acclimated range denatures critical metabolic proteins and disrupts membrane fluidity beyond the organisms' capacity for thermal compensation",
        "D": "Fluid pressure increases linearly with depth (P = \u03c1gh). Deep-sea organisms maintain internal pressures matching their environment. Rapid ascent causes a dramatic pressure drop: dissolved gases expand and form bubbles in tissues (similar to decompression sickness in divers), and gas-filled organs like swim bladders rupture.
