Vivek and Kamala's teacher gave them a system of linear equations to solve. They each took a few steps that led to the systems shown in the table below. So we have the teacher's original system, what Vivek got after doing some operations, what Kamala got after doing some operations. Which of them obtained a system that is equivalent to the teacher's system? So the first question we should ask ourselves is what does it mean to even have an equivalent system? For the sake of this question or for our purposes, an equivalent system is a system that has the same solution. So if there's some xy pair that satisfies the teacher's system that is the solution to the teacher's system, well Vivek's system, we're gonna call it equivalent if it has the same solution. Say it similarly, if Kamala's system has the same solution, then we're going to call it equivalent to the teacher's system. So let's make some comparisons here. So first, let's look at Vivek. So his first equation is actually unchanged from the teacher's equation. So any solution that meets both of these equations is for sure gonna meet this top equation because it's literally the same as the top equation of the teacher, so that works out. Now let's look at the second one. The second one is definitely, this is a different, this second equation is definitely a different equation over here. We can check that it's not just being multiplied by some number on both sides. To go from one to zero, if you were multiplying, you'd have to multiply one times zero. And then if you wanted, in order to maintain the equation, you would have to do that on both sides, but zero times this left-hand side would have been zero. You would have gotten zero equals zero. So he didn't just scale both sides by some number. Looks like he did another operation. He probably looks like he's adding or subtracting something to both sides. So let's see how he could have gotten this right over here. So he took negative four x plus five y is equal to one. And it looks like from that, he was able to get negative three x plus seven y is equal to zero. So let's see what he might have, what he had to do to do that. Let's see, he would have had to, to go from negative four x to negative three x, he would have had to add an x. So I can just write an x right over there. To go from five y to seven y, he would have had to add two y. So on the left-hand side, he would have had to add x plus two y. Notice we have an x plus two y right over there. And on the right-hand side, he would have had to add, or subtract a one, or add a negative one. Notice we see a negative one right over there. So what he essentially did is he added the left-hand sides of these two equations to get this new left-hand side right over here, and he added the right-hand sides to get this new right-hand side. And that is a legitimate operation. The, this new equation that you got, this new, this new linear equation, it's going to represent a different line than this one right over here. But the resulting system is going to have the same solution. Why do we feel confident that the resulting system is going to have the same solution? Well, for an xy pair that satisfies, that satisfies both of these equations, that's what a solution would be. For that xy pair, x plus two y is equal to negative one. So for that solution, we're adding the same thing to both sides. We're saying, look, I'm gonna add x plus two y to the left-hand side. Well, I need to add, if I don't wanna change the solution, I have to add the same thing to the right-hand side. Well, they're telling us, for the solution to this equation, x plus two y is equal to negative one. So negative one is the same thing as x plus two y for that solution. So we're not going to change the resulting solution of the system. So it's a completely legitimate operation. What Vivek did is adding the left-hand sides and adding the right-hand sides to get this new second equation. That's not going to change the solution of the system. In fact, that's a technique we often use to eventually find the solution of a system. So now let's look at Camila or Camila. So her first equation is actually the exact same equation as the teacher's second equation. Now, let's see, her second equation, how does it relate possibly to the first equation? So just looking at it offhand, it looks like it might just be, it looks like she just multiplied both sides times the number. It looks like that number, she clearly multiplied the right-hand side times negative eight. So times negative eight. Negative one times negative eight is positive eight. And it looks like she also multiplied the left-hand side by negative eight. Negative eight times x is negative eight x. Negative eight times two y is negative 16 y. So she just multiplied both sides by the same value, which actually doesn't change the equation. This actually is going to be, it changes it the way it looks, but it actually represents the same line. So this is definitely still an equivalent system. These are still the same constraints. You're going to have the same solution. Whenever you're dealing with systems, you're not going to change the solution of the system as long as you either multiply both sides of an equation by a scalar, or you're adding and subtracting the equations. When I say add or subtract equations, you're adding the left-hand side to the left-hand side, adding the right-hand side to the right-hand side like we had here, or subtracting the one from the other on the left-hand side. We subtract the bottom from the top on the left-hand, we subtract the bottom from the top on the right-hand, it's not going to change our solution. So both of them, both of them obtained a system that is equivalent, meaning that it has the same solution as the teacher's system.
