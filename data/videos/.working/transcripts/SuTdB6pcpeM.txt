We're told a camping group gathers three bundles of firewood with 17 logs in each bundle. Later, they use nine logs to start a campfire. How many logs are left? I guess after they use those nine logs. So pause this video and have a go at this before we do this together. All right, now let's work on this together. So the first thing I think about is, all right, the camping group started with three bundles and each of those bundles had 17 logs. So the amount that they started off with is going to be three, which we do in the same colors. So they would have started off with three times 17. So this right over here is what they're starting out with. And so we'd wanna figure that out first. So this is starting amount, starting. And then you'd wanna subtract out what they used. And we see that they use nine logs. So then we wanna subtract out those nine. So let's do that computation. So first let's do 17 times three. I'll do that over here on the side. So 17 times three, times three, go to a neutral color here. So in the ones place, seven times three is 21. We'll regroup that those two tens of the 21 into the tens place. And then one times three is three, it's actually 30, because we're talking about three tens. And then we have these two more tens. And so we get 51. So the starting amount is 51. And then from that, we are going to subtract nine. Now, some of you might be able to do this in your head. My head would say, all right, if I did 51 minus 10, it would be 41, but I'm subtracting one less than this. So this is going to be 42. But if you wanted to do it using the traditional way, you could say 51 minus nine, minus nine like this. You start in the ones place and you say, well, I can't subtract nine from one, but I can regroup. I can take 10 from the tens place. So I have four tens left. And when I write those 10, that one 10 in the ones place, it becomes 10. So it's 10 plus this one right over here. So it's 11. 11 minus nine is two. And then four tens minus no tens is four tens, 42. So how many logs left? 42.
