Hello, welcome back. And today's session is going to be a little bit joyful, I hope. And it's, the point is, joy isn't fluff, how gratitude, fun, laughter can actually save schools and sanity. So we start with our mood meter because it is May. And may the fourth be with you earlier this month. I'd love to say how are you feeling on a scale of baby Yoda? So you can either type it in the chat, or just think to yourself how you're feeling on a scale of baby Yoda. I'll just smile for a second, see if anyone wants to add. Great, I am feeling, honestly, a little four, but I'm a two to present to you. Okay, we got a five. Kind of like a little bit okay. Awesome. Well, again, my name is Danielle Sullivan. I am in charge of the Northeast for district partnerships with Khan Academy. And I am excited for you to join me on this almost second to last version of all of these Northeast learning collectives. And today is all about you and joy and gratitude. So I would love to know, thinking about just towards the end of the school year, wow, it's like after Memorial Day, it's wild. I can't believe May is almost done. What do you need right now? So just do a self check. Do you need a nap? Do you need to laugh? Do you need an immediate win? Or do you need to find an exit? So if somebody wants to type in the chat, if not, just think about it. I definitely need a nap. But I'm hopeful that I think laughing with y'all today is going to be fun. So take a self assessment. Where are you right now? So what we are going to talk through today, why does joy matter now more than ever, the science behind laughter, gratitude and fun, some practical tools, where AI can definitely lighten the load for you, and then how to create your own joyful plan. So this is our agenda for today. It'll be a light and fluffy filled with research. And let's go. So yes, things are still very hard. It is just been a really intense couple of months. But I would argue it's been a tense couple of years in education. But what I want to share with you today is how we can use joy as a strategy, laughter as resistance to stress and all this other stuff that's happening. And gratitude can be how we build what is coming. And research shows and I'm going to dig into the research a little bit today that even brief experiences of joy can interrupt stress patterns and build resilience over time. So we're going to start today with a little bit of these quick jolts of joy. I just recently started to look at Instagram, which is a terrible thing for me because it is a huge time suck. I have been very good about not being on social media. But this video I've watched so many times, I think it's hilarious. So hopefully you find this a little hilarious too. Yep. Thank God nobody overreacted. The one that jumps. Oh, and then there's another one. And the cat, I don't know if any of you own cats, but this is like a classic, classic hilarious, very funny thing. So there's some other jolts of joy. Here are some good questions that you could start a staff meeting with. I think it's a little, we're a little slow after a long weekend. So I'm just going to ask you, you can think about it. If you want to type in the chat, that's great. If not, I'm just going, if you're watching this, no worries, you can just think about it. Or you can use these questions with your staff, colleagues, family, but I'd love to know who had the weirdest win this week. Or maybe you want to give somebody a quick shout out who did something amazing. Or what's something totally ridiculous that you believed in as a kid? And, or if joy were a dessert, what would it be? Something that is light, a quick jolts of joy with this, like asking any of these questions again, can help relieve some of that stress. So I want to do a quick shout out. I think Brandy, you might have been to every one of these webinars. So what, what? Quick shout out. And I think maybe we have a couple, Christine, I've seen you at a couple of webinars and Susan. So what, what? Thank you so much for attending all of these. So quick shout out to y'all. Something I totally believe, what was ridiculous that I believed in as a child. I still believe in some weird stuff. I can't think of one right now. And I would say if joy were a dessert for me, it would be banoffee. If you've ever had banoffee, it is so good. It is toffee. It is bananas, whipped cream. Oh, it's an English dessert. It's very, very good. So again, another quick jolt of joy. You can use humor memes. So I'm going to give you a second to like, take this in. Whoever tweeted this is hilarious. Right. Yes, thank you. You guys really seemed happy. So apparently there's now parking spaces reserved for people who twerk at barbecues. And I just saw this one, which is also hilarious. Rachel has 16 chocolate bars. Tracy takes four from her and asks for the remaining quarter. What would she end up with? This child wrote a slap. Now that is not a correct math answer, but that is hilarious, which reminded me one time, my senior AP calculus exam, they always tell me just write something down. So I ended up writing a poem about the math problems. I didn't know how to do it. And I still got partial credit. So I think the teacher should have given this kid partial credit. So we want to find moments of joy, especially now, especially at the end of the year. And why, why does joy and laughter and gratitude and fun actually, why, why is it not fluff? Well, it helps make learning stick. And I have been sharing this with you. If you've come to any more of these webinars, we have been talking about the neuroscience of all of this. But joy, right? There's that there's a feel good hormone called dopamine. It is a neurotransmitter released when we experience pleasure or reward. It actually helps to enhance motivation, attention, memory, especially when it's tied to emotional experiences. And David Sousa, who wrote How the Brain Learns, I love his research. Students are more likely to retain information when it's associated with positive emotions. So not only does laughter and just feeling grateful and joy and fun and play, not only does all of that feel good, it helps us learn more, right? A joyful lesson isn't just more fun. It's actually neurobiologically more effective. And how a moment feels will create more memory hooks for students. So I know a lot of times after state testing, this this ends up being the fun month, you know, like the last three weeks of June and the Northeast field trips and all of those projects that everyone wanted to do all year. I'm just inviting you all to say think through this could happen every single day, like where are those joyful moments that we can increase dopamine and dopamine also build trust and relationships. So again, you can show quick dopamine hits showing something cute. This is actually my dog. I find her cute. Hopefully you find her cute. But this makes me smile because for Christmas, we got a pillow with her face. And sometimes we put this in the window and freak people out because it doesn't move. So that's also really fun, because she loves to sit in the window watching the cars and whatnot. Having joyful photos of and stories that helps even open students up to learning if you start with something that is a personal story or a fun, you know, animals work really, really well, y'all. Or if a teacher wants to do some fun math problems, or using this is where AI is going to really help it because sometimes at this time of year, especially creativity is like making learning stick using fun play laughter. Also, gratitude. What is gratitude do? It helps reduce the cortisol in our bodies. So dopamine is the feel good hormone, right builds relationship and trust. Cortisol is that stress hormone, which limits our ability to think and have that prefrontal cortex thinking. So practicing gratitude can lower the stress levels, which reduces the physical impacts of stress. Because when you are stressed, you can't really learn or really function or think very well. Right. And when you have so much cortisol, it's just you need to be able to calm your brain and body. And we've talked about this too. And in fact, there's been studies that show gratitude can activate the brain regions associated with empathy, moral cognition and reward. And gratitude interventions actually led to increases in neural sensitivity to kindness, well being even months afterwards. So there is a lot of research behind why gratitude works. So why does it matter in schools? Schools are high stress environments, they are. There's a lot going on. And I'd say even now, post COVID, it's even more stressful. So if you have a brief moment of gratitude, a joy jolt, it can help reset the nervous system. And it will continue to build trust. All of this is in service of learning. So what are some other quick ways I've shared with this last week or last month, actually, but it's just worth re reminding y'all even having a weekly win board, this could be a school-wide board, this could be something in your faculty room, this could be something in classrooms. But having a win so people can be grateful and show gratitude towards each other by celebrating something that went well. You can also have same thing, weekly wins, you can have a gratitude tag board in. There's lots of ways to do this. You can hand out sticky notes to kids, you could have just pause and just turn to a neighbor and say, what are you grateful for today? Like there's so many quick ways to do this, but it is really important to have some sort of habit of this. And then for play. Play is something Oprah just had an article, I think I read it last week. I think it was in her Oprah journal about the importance of play. Stuart Brown is one of the founding researchers. He literally wrote the book, Play, but there's so much fuel for curiosity, connection and creativity. And especially now with the amount of AI in schools, with the amount of ed tech in schools, we don't just want schools to be another place where students are in front of screens and creating playful opportunities will help increase learning. Why? So I said Dr. Stuart Brown, it's a biological drive and important for health and sleep and nutrition. It's the same it's like as important as sleep and nutrition are for us, which I just don't think we think about that. It increases neuroplasticity, which is our brain's ability to learn and have learning stick. It improves problem solving. It enhances social bonds. Wouldn't these be great things to have in classrooms and it's release. It helps relieve stress in the workplace or sorry, it helps relieve stress and increase satisfaction in the workplace. It heals stress faster than resting. Like if you actually are playing, it'll definitely lower your cortisol. And then playful staff cultures retain people longer. People especially, you know, it's really difficult to retain not retain. Well, if you have an amazing teacher who leaves, it's hard to replace them. And then also a lot of people are just having a hard time filling teaching positions. If you can have a playful culture, people want to be in your building. Students want to come to school. So here's some ideas. This I saw, which is a really interesting idea. And I know we're closing out the school year, but thinking through the summer potentially into next school year, I saw this in a school. So in the beginning of the year, each staff member got a puzzle piece that they could decorate and design it, however. And then they made a giant puzzle. When you walk in, you saw like all of the pieces that fit together as humans in their building, which I think is such a cool idea. So you could do this with students. You could even have all of the students in your building in the beginning of the year have a puzzle piece and each grade level could have the different, how the puzzle pieces fit together, just showing it's playful. It's a fun way to show that everyone in the building means something to each other. Another way to play, I call this mission impossible. So what you could do is hold up an object, could be any object, and you have to think of all of the ways the object can be used, not for its intended purpose. For instance, what is this? This is a paperclip. What are all the things you can do with a paperclip that don't include putting holding papers together? Like it could be a tiny hanger for mouse clothes. It could be a way to get into a locked door. You could also use it to reset those. You could use the paperclip to reset things that only have that tiny button. It's really hard to push. Things like that. You could hold up chapstick. What is chapstick? Give me five other uses for this besides chapstick. Like you could roll out tiny dough. I could use it to throw at people. I could have it be a massager, like a finger massager. It's another way of just in the moment, playful things that you can do in staff meetings. So I do, when we talk about laughter and joy and gratitude in play, I want to point out something called toxic positivity. That happens quite often in schools. I've seen it correct. I've seen, especially after COVID, we've gone from overcorrecting with the positivity being like, yes, let's just smile and everything's going to be great. You're fine. Choose joy. Just show up and you're fine. No, no. Toxie positivity. It's huge in our culture because people don't know what to do with difficult emotions. Sometimes they're just like, smile, fake it till you make it. Everything's going to be fine. Just be happy. Why can't you just be happy? It ignores that life is hard and it also breeds resentment. So if you're a leader, that's like, everyone should just show up and be grateful and smile. No, that's not what I'm talking about. In fact, you can call it reframe strategic optimism. It means you acknowledge that things are hard, but you can look for areas of hope and this is more culturally sustainable. So the strategies that I'm sharing today are not to reinforce any toxic positivity, just be happy, be happy. It's more how can we acknowledge that things are hard, but find moments of joy and plagues. We know that's what humans need and we know that that's really good for learning. So I would love for you to take a quick pause reflection moment. So if you want to share in the chat, you can. If not, this is just more for you. When's the last time you saw a colleague belly laugh at work? Like have you had a lot of joyful moments at work or the last time you laughed so hard you cried? Can you remember that? I think mine was two days ago. Sometimes, you know, things just they just like tickle your funny bone. So I accidentally punched my friend in the face and I still think it's really funny. It wasn't funny, but I still think it's really funny. So when's the last time? All right, let me see. Oh, great. You guys, you have been sharing in the chat. So you had an office mate that would scratch his ear with a paper clip. Oh my gosh. So, Brandi, yesterday, wonderful. Can you think of another? Can any of the rest of you just think about it as when's the last time you laughed so hard? And if you can't think of it, then I highly recommend you watch something that makes you laugh. I mean, it can we all have different senses of humor, right? But if it's a short video or another video or whatever, or you listen to, you know, go read some jokes online, whatever makes you laugh. It's so good to laugh because it reduces stress. So that is our little quick moment of the research behind why we are talking about all of these things today. So now let's get into some practical tools on what you can do in your buildings and through the summer and next year and and. Here's another idea for you. Maybe you all could institute funny first Fridays, meaning you would use humor as a cultural currency. Why would this work? Because humor can help create psychological safety, laughing together, trusting together. So if you have any issues with staff or you are feeling overwhelmed, humor can be a really great way to bond. But again, everyone has different types of humor, but you can invite your staff to share how they're feeling with a meme or each week, you know, teachers can bring a meme. You all can vote on the funniest meme. Like I found this because this is how I feel sometimes when I walk into teachers. Well, when I used to be in professional learning and sometimes I would walk in and I would say, let's begin with an icebreaker and this is the reaction teachers would give you like, no, or God forbid you ask them to move. I've tried to have movement and like multiple groups in a professional learning session. No, do not ask a veteran teacher to go in. Somebody sits down. You don't have them move. No. So you could have your educators actually bring a different meme. You could vote on which is the funniest. You could have educators bring jokes. So what happened to the cat who ate the ball of yarn? She had mittens. I got that from dad jokes. Or you could actually vote on funny videos. So here is another funny video that I got sucked in an Instagram, but hopefully you find this a little bit joyful. I don't know if I don't even remember Night at the Roxbury, which is hilarious too. But yeah, so you could create a culture in your buildings or teachers can do this in their classrooms that you start the Friday with something fun, joyful, humorous. You could also institute something called no agenda time because so many times everything is packed, packed, packed, packed. You have a thousand things to talk about at a staff meeting, a million things to talk about and PLCs. So how can you create space in the day just to be human and relationships are built with space and time, not on slide 22 presentation. They're built when you can actually give educators time. So you could start something coffee hour. You could just one day and not just on teacher appreciation week, but you could bring in coffee in the morning and invite teachers into your office and just chat. No agenda, no stress, just to catch up just for, just for, you know, you can designate one or two days a month as like coffee days. Also, you could have structured chat time, but without any agenda, but carving out time for teachers to talk to each other besides what, you know, their school day or students. The activity three good things is really nice. If you wanted to even kind of create a little structure around it, but you can just share three things that are going well in your life or three good things from this week. It's a positive psychology trick, but just giving teachers space to be adults and human and not always talking about lesson planning problems, whatever. I mean, my friends would always joke teachers are so, we, we, we talk about teaching all the time. Like I don't, I don't think I'm invited to many more dinner parties when we're in education, because even when we're out to dinner with friends and there's another teacher there, forget it. Like we just always start talking about school. I don't know if that's happening to you or your experience. So can you create times to have space and time at school where you're not talking about school? And that's amazing. That's how Brandi made some of her best friends, just chatting, chatting, because you are working with these people and teaching can be very lonely when you, you know, close the classroom door, if you're the only adult in there, unless you have a co-teacher, but it can be very lonely. So offering these times can be very helpful for staff connection. And the third potential culture shift, which could be helpful is staff shout out chains. Gratitude that moves. So what one school did, you know, the paper chains that you actually have a slip of paper, create change. Can you see what I'm doing here? So you could have all of your staff write something they're grateful for or a shout out recognizing one of the colleagues and then they keep adding to it. So it would, by the time it gets to the certain teacher, there might be like 10 different shout outs on the chain. So you can create, that's actually, it's something you can do with staff. You can do it with students. It's a lot of versions of this. You could have it as a bulletin board or you can have physical chains. It would pass from room to room. They would shout out their staff members, add to the chain, then you can display it somewhere. It just helps build more community through like a visual representation, just like I love the puzzle pieces on the wall, because it's showing that your staff is interconnected when people walk into your building. This would be showing it's literally building community with a physical representation around gratitude, something that's, you know, doing well. All of these are positivity hacks, not toxic positivity, to make this come alive and for people to really protect the learning environments in your buildings. All right. We've come to another pause and reflect time. What's one thing that didn't suck this week? I know it's early. It's only Tuesday. But can you think of one thing that didn't suck? Interesting way of framing this, right? So for me, I get to talk to y'all about joy and gratitude and fun. So that didn't suck. I love doing this. I appreciate those of you who are watching. I appreciate those of you who have come every single time and are very consistent. Oh, my gosh, it's warm and sunny there. Yes, that totally does not suck. That's great, because I know it's been raining, raining, raining. Oh, daughter got honor roll this morning. That's amazing. Intentional time with family. That's wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing. So this, this is definitely going to be a little bit shorter of a presentation, but I want to now talk about AI. So we've talked about joy, science behind it, some tools, more ideas. And like I said, I've give you a lot of ideas in these as the whole point. But now let's actually zoom in. How can AI help create more joyful moments? First of all, I used a lot of AI to help me with the pictures, things like that. AI has been helping me curb my creation, expediting, making it a lot faster for me to create things, which I've really appreciated and been super grateful for. Oh, great. Thank you for sharing. Another one-to-one visits with librarians. No agenda, just a chat and chew. I love the chat and chew. So like, just having like lunch with different staff members. That's amazing. So AI is not going to fix the system, but it can give you your Sunday nights back. How can we use AI tools to help streamline some of your productivity and even helping you protect the creativity and play and joy, especially when you are burnt out, when you are stressed out, when you are overwhelmed, you're not going to think of these creative ideas. That's why I'm sharing some cool ideas with you. Because I know once you have all these great plans in the fall, and then as the school year starts, like sometimes they go by the wait side, but every day is a new day. So we have ConMigo tools. They are free. Any human on the planet can sign up for a free Con Academy account, and all the teachers in the US can get our teacher tools for free. The next session in June, we are going to talk a little bit more about what our district partnerships look like. And then I'm also going to share some more of what's happening coming in the future, what we're doing with assessments, what we're doing for back to school 26, which is very exciting. But that is not today. Today we talk about free. So you could use our free AI teacher tools to help streamline things. And in the fall, we're going to have a couple more tools tailored for leaders and our planning tools. And our planning tools. So if you get a free Con Academy account, ConMigo account for the teacher tools, the purple are the planning. Those are designed to help save Sunday nights from exit ticket lesson hooks. We have lesson planning, recommended assignments. The other option for helping you become a little bit more creative and creating those joy, laughter, gratitude moments in classrooms and buildings is the green tab. That's where we have the look at generator, which is the gamification review content. It's kind of like a hoot. Class newsletters, you can even create informational text. You can make a poem, anything into a poem, create your multiple choice quiz, rubrics, questions, report card comments, letters of recommendations. So this is another way of creating things to help save you time. But now I'm going to share some creative prompts with you. And we will make this, I think we can make this into actual, like a PDF that I'll share back out when we share this video. So I was playing with some whimsical prompts because Con Academy is amazing to really help fill in skill gaps. And there's a lot of use cases for it. Our teacher tools are amazing. But if you do partner with us, you do get chat GPT as part of the partnership, but also an archon Migo student facing resources. I've been playing with this too, but you can use these prompts with chat GPT. You can use them with Con Migo, but these are just more playful when it comes to learning. Like explain this concept to me like a dinosaur telling a story. Describe that idea like you are a pirate. Tell me about, you know, photosynthesis, like a superhero giving advice. And there's a typo. Write a poem about something like write a poem about the Pythagorean theorem, like a robot learning emotions. Explain the concept like a wizard casting a spell. Describe a day in the life of an object or animal as if it could talk. So you can even personify different contents or maybe the Declaration of Independence could talk. Tell a story about any topic from the perspective of an alien visiting earth. So I want to talk about lunar cycles from an alien visiting earth. Explain anything like a comedian making jokes about it. I did, you could do your school newsletter, like a standup routine. I tried that. It wasn't very funny, but you know, you could tweak it. Pretend you're a detective solving a mystery about the Civil War. Describe a topic as if you're time traveler from the future. So I'm going to show you what happens when you try some of these prompts live using Khan Academy and Con Migo. Which does anyone have a strong pull of which one you'd want to try first? I think we're going to do Dinosaur and let's try the standup. Why not? Let's see. So I'm going to go live. This is again, Khan Academy. This is free. So any of your teachers can sign up for an account and get access to all of our teacher tools free. With the partnerships comes chat GPT. So I'm just going to show you what it would be if we use chat GPT and then I'll show you what Khan Migo looks like with within the student resources. So this is the chat GPT. Did it come here? It's still loading. So if this doesn't work. All right, here we go. So what was the prompt? Let's talk. Let's ask. Can you describe photo? I can never spell that like a dinosaur. Telling a story. Telling a story. So this would be the teacher version. You could ask chat GPT. Any also regular chat GPT would help you do this. So yeah, they're rounds little one and listen to Dino Dave's tale of the magic green leaves. So now it's describing photosynthesis like a dinosaur. How fun would that be to read that to students or you can actually have Khan Migo talk out loud so you could have this read to students. Students could come up with their own fun prompts, how to explain something like the detective, and then we can also say what was the other it was the stand up. I want to get the prompt right. As you know, prompting is really important. So explain blank like a comedian makes any jokes about it. Okay. Explain the schedule changes like a comedian making jokes about it. All right, let's see what let's see what they say. Okay, ideally, the internet would work everything with magical. So trying it and I wasn't as specific with the schedule changes, but you get the point. So if you use whimsical prompts, this can be very fun for students and fun for you. You could have teachers tell you their data like a comedian telling jokes, but maybe not that. Maybe the data wouldn't be great, but there's a lot of ways to just take things that you normally talk about, but have a little bit of play on top of it and AI is really good for that. So questions about that comments. This little thinking. I love the thinking phase two until let's see, did he come up with it? No, he was I think we stumped Khan Migo. So cool, cool, cool. What would you do with two extra hours what would you do with two extra hours in a week? Because we've heard that these teacher tools are saving teachers at least two hours a week. What I do, I actually would use AI to supercharge all of these creative projects that I've been wanting to do like write a musical forever, or write a storybook for kids. It's really fascinating how quickly when you can learn to do the tools, how much more productive you can be. So the last piece I'm going to share with you today is how can you create your own joy plan? It is the end of the school year. It is very, you did a great job. You want to get some rest and then you're start planning for the next school year. But it's important to please, please, take time to be playful. So this was me when I taught fifth grade, I loved to play. I didn't at first. I mean, I told my story on the writing session, but just real quick, I used to be a fifth and sixth grade special education teacher in Central New York. And after my third year of teaching, I really got burned out. I was like so overwhelmed. I felt like nothing I do did worked. So I did a summer long professional development with the National Writing Project. And it reminded me that I'm human. And I started to write and then writing became a huge important part of my life. I then had the courage to audition for an improv comedy troupe. And I brought all of my learning and play back into the classroom. So I was actually playing weekly in improv. It changed my life. And I miss it. But now I do a lot of improv in in my job, like after I transitioned out of from being a teacher, I worked with teachers. So as you can tell, I really love to just use humor and play in everything that I do. But it was that moment when I was burned out and needed something different. So we for Halloween, I had students carve pumpkins and taste the seeds and we illegally cooked them in the classroom with the toaster oven. But we wrote poems about it. We did sensory experiences we really used. I tried to do as many playful things as I could when in teaching even in math. We were talking about word problems, I would bring things in to make them come to life. So it is an attitude. It is a mindset shift that you too can be playful with your staff. It doesn't have to be forced. But it can be fun. And I'm telling you, if you just add a couple of these, it'll make everyone's day so much better. So what is your joy plan? First, it's important to remember your why. What? Why? Why? Why do you do what you do? Why are you a leader? Why are you an education? For me, when I did my wine, it boiled down to three words, connection, joy, making a difference. I love to connect with educators. I love to find joy myself. I love to present things joyfully. And I want to feel like I am making a difference. So what brings you joy at work? When do you feel most alive as a leader? What makes your team laugh, relax, or light up? You take some time to think through this, it will help you dig deeper to want to do some of these joyful things because you have to your why is why you do everything. And if you are struggling to do something, it's because your why is not big enough. Your why is going to be the light that shines in times of darkness. It's not if there will be times of darkness, it is when that's where the why really helps you dig deep to be able to show up for the teachers in your buildings. The other thing I want you to consider for your joy plan is giving yourself permission. We are so hard on ourselves as educators. So how can you give yourself permission to do this? Like it's okay to pause the spreadsheet and take a hallway walk for no reason, just go around the hallway and just say hi to people. It's okay to do that because by you, you know, you're getting frustrated, you're trying to do your data analysis, but then getting out in the building smiling, walking the hallway, it's okay to do that. It's okay to share when you're struggling. You don't have to go at this alone. It's okay to build fun into the serious stuff, as long as it's for the right reason. And it's okay not to know everything no one does. So how can you give yourself permission to do any of these activities? And I am going to reference Kristin Neff's work. If you've ever heard of her, she literally wrote the book called Self-Compassion. And I love this little graphic because it kind of explains all of her research and one graphic, but her point of self-compassion is that it takes three things to be self-compassion. First, self-kindness. We need to be as caring to ourselves as others are to us. Many times we are very hard on ourselves, especially in education, especially when you become a teacher leader, leader leader, coach, principal, superintendent, all of it. We tend to be very focused on perfection. Students tend to be very focused on perfection. So how can we be as kind to ourselves as others would be kind to us? Then recognize that we're part of a community. Like if you're having a really hard day, you may not be the only one who's having a hard day and that makes us human. So sometimes when you get really stressed, this happens to my sister too. It actually happens to all of us, not just my sister. But sometimes when you get into a stress mode, it's hard to see out of it. But her research shows that if you can know that you're not alone, that suffering's a part of life, it's okay. That helps be kind to yourself. And then mindfulness, knowing that it's a moment and the moment could pass. Maybe your moment is a moment. Maybe your moment is a week. Maybe it's been a year, but it will pass. It will get better. So it's really being kind to yourself. This is another activity that if we were live together, you would turn and talk to a partner, but I want you to think about this. It's giving somebody a compliment, but this part's the hardest part. So you're going to give someone a compliment, but I don't want you to compliment like my glasses. Danielle, I love your glasses. My glasses didn't do anything. Danielle, I love all the ideas that you bring. And then the person has to say, thank you. It's true. We bad away compliments, like you're playing badminton. It's very hard for people to receive compliments. So this is something that it's, if you share a compliment with someone, you want to take it in and say, thank you. It's true. So I'd love to know, pause and reflect, what made you smile this week? What made you smile today? What made you smile during this presentation? For me, I love that dog. I think the dog dancing in the car is hilarious. I also find the cats very funny too. So today, the gift I'm going to give you is 15 minutes of your life back, but just reminders, joy is not fluff. Joy is essential. Laughter, gratitude, fun, play, all of these help increase learning, help reduce stress, and they can really change the entire culture of your school. And they're just small moments. It doesn't have to be huge. You don't need a whole curriculum about it. Sprinkle in all of these small things, use AI to help you and make sure you have your own why and your own joy plan. I would love to know if you're able to type in the chat, what's one thing that you liked about today's presentation. And then we'll talk about the final next steps. Or if you're watching this, just one thing, one thing that you learned. Oh, getting to see your daughter in honor roll this morning and getting to attend this webinar led by me. Thank you, Brandy. Thank you. It's true. That's a big day. Brandy had a great day. Well, I want to take a moment and just say thank you. I appreciate all of you showing up. I appreciate what you're doing. You are working so hard. You deserve all of the things for being a school leader, for making sure that you are definitely showing up for students. And if you want to learn more, again, we have a landing page, but this is me. Our final webinar will be in June, where I'll talk a little bit more about Khan Academy, Khanmigo. And I'll talk a little bit about what's coming with assessment and what's coming for Back to School 26, which is really exciting. We're doing some really new, innovative things. But I appreciate all of you. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week, and I will see you in a couple weeks. Thank you so much.
