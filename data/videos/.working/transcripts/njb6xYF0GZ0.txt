Farmer Jan is a vegetable farmer who divides his field between broccoli crops and spinach crops. Last year he grew six tons of broccoli per acre, so six tons of broccoli per acre, and nine tons of spinach, nine tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. This year he grew two tons of broccoli per acre, so this year he grew two tons of broccoli per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 31 tons of vegetables. How many acres of broccoli crops and how many acres of spinach crops does Farmer Jan have? So let's think about this. So let's say that the number of acres of broccoli crops, let's call that B, and let's say the acres of spinach crops, the acres of spinach crops, let's call that S. So how much broccoli is he going to grow in, I guess you could say last year? Last year, how much broccoli did he grow? Let me just write this down. This is last year. Last, last year? And they tell us, last year he grew six tons of broccoli per acre. So if he grew six tons of broccoli per acre, and he has B acres, well that means he grew six tons per acre times B acres. So he grew six B tons of broccoli last year, and by the same logic, he grew, how much spinach? Well nine tons of spinach per acre times S acres, so nine S tons of spinach, and then the total is 93 tons. So for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 93. So now let's think about this year. And in general when you tackle these, just think about, well set the variables in general to what they're asking for, and then how can you use the information that they're giving us? So this year, how much broccoli would he have grown? Well he grew two tons of broccoli per acre. So he grew two tons per acre. He has the same number of acres, we can assume that. So two tons per acre times B acres is gonna be two B tons of broccoli. And by that same logic, it's going to be, he grew three tons of spinach per acre. Well he has S acres, each of those acres he's growing three tons of spinach per acre. So it's going to be three S tons of spinach. And they tell us what that total is. That total is for a total of 31 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 31. And so now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns that we can use to solve for B and S. So let's see, what do we want to solve for first? Well what we could do, let me rewrite the top equation. So we have six B plus nine S is equal to 93. Is equal to 93. And the second equation, well let's try to eliminate, let's try to eliminate the B's. So let's multiply the second equation by negative three. So negative, I'm going to multiply the left hand side by negative three, and I'm going to multiply the right hand side by negative three. And so what am I going to get? Negative three times two B is negative six B. That was the whole point by multiplying it by negative three. Negative three times three S is negative nine S. Negative nine S. And then negative three times 31 is going to be negative 93. So what do we get if we now add the two sides of these equations? So on the left hand side, six B minus six B, that's zero. Nine S minus nine S, that's zero. We're going to get just zero. On the right hand side we get 93 minus 93. Well that's still just going to be zero. So we have this situation where we get zero equals zero, which is going to be true no matter what X and Y are. And so this is a system with an infinite number of solutions. So this has infinite, infinite, infinite number of solutions. So one way we could think about it is, these two constraints, they're not giving us enough information. There's an infinite number of B and S combinations that would satisfy these equations. So they're not giving us enough information to say how exactly what B and S are. So there is not enough, not enough info, but an exclamation mark there.
