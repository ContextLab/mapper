So let's see if we can subtract 25 from 83, or if we can figure out what 83 minus 25 is. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can work through it. So I'm assuming you've had a try, and when you tried to work through it, you probably first went to the ones place right over here, and you probably said, hey, I have three ones on top, and from that I want to subtract five ones. But then you said, wait, I can't subtract five ones from three ones? Five is more than three. What do I do? And what you do is what I'm about to show you. You do something called regrouping. You take some of the value that's in the tens place and put it into the ones place. What am I talking about? I'm gonna do it three different ways, so you really hopefully understand what's going on. Well, you want this three to be more ones. You want it to be at least as large as five or larger. So how do you do that? Well, you could take a 10 from the tens place. So instead of having eight tens here, you could take one of them away, and then you're going to have seven tens here. And then if you take a 10, because I just took a 10 away from here and you put it in the ones place, that's going to be 10. So 10 plus three is 13. 10 plus three is 13. So what did I do again? 83 is eight tens and three ones. You could also think of it as seven tens and 13 ones. And I'm gonna do it again in a couple of different ways to make that clear. But let's just work through this now. Because now you have 13 ones minus five ones, which is going to be eight ones. And then you go to the tens place, and you say seven tens minus two tens, well, that's going to be five tens. So your answer is going to be five tens and eight ones, or 58. Now I said I would do this several ways so that it makes a little bit more sense, so let's do that. So another way that you could write 83 is you could write this, this is the same thing as 80, 80 plus three. 80 plus three, that's the same thing as 83. Eight tens, three ones, eight tens, three ones. And 25 is the same thing, is the same thing as 20 plus five. 20 plus five. Now we're going to subtract 20 plus five. So let's write this instead as we're going to subtract 20, we're going to subtract two tens, and we're going to subtract five ones. So subtracting 25 is the same thing as subtracting 20 and then subtracting five. So now let's try to work through it, just like we did. Well, we go to the ones place again, and once again we say five, if I want to take five away from three, that's hard, I don't know how to do that just yet. But what if I take 10 from here? So if I take a 10, if I take 10 from there, that's going to be 70, and if I put that 10 in the ones place, well 10 plus three is going to be 13. Notice, I haven't changed the value of the number. 70 plus 13 is the exact same thing as 80 plus three, which is 83. But what's useful about this is now in the ones place, I can subtract five from 13. Well, if I subtract five from 13, I'm going to get an eight, and then if I subtract two 10s from seven 10s, or 20 from 70, I'm going to get 50. I'm going to get 50. So this is going to end up being 50 plus eight, which is the exact same thing as 58. Five 10s and eight ones. Now I said I would do it a third way, and these are all the same way, I'm just writing it down in different ways. So I could also write 83, I could write this down as eight 10s, eight 10s plus three ones. All right, this is the 10s place, this is the ones place, eight 10s, three ones. And I'm going to subtract two 10s and five ones. So I could write, so this is going to be minus, minus two 10s, minus two 10s, and minus three ones. Sorry, minus five ones. Minus five ones. Five ones. 25 is the same thing as 20 and five. If I'm subtracting 25, that's the same thing as subtracting 20 and then subtracting five. And that's the same thing as subtracting two 10s and then subtracting five ones. Two 10s and five ones. So let's then work this out. So this is going to be, well, as soon as we try to subtract five ones from three ones, we say, hey, wait, that's not making any sense. Let me make the value here larger, and I'm going to do that by regrouping from the 10s place. So instead of writing this as eight 10s, I'm going to take one of those 10s away, I'm going to write it as seven 10s, and then put that 10 in the ones place. Well, one 10 is equal to 10 ones. So if I add it to the three, this is going to be 13 ones. And now I can subtract. 13 ones minus five ones is eight ones. And seven 10s minus two 10s is five 10s. Five 10s, and we are done. These are all different ways of doing this exact same problem with regrouping.
