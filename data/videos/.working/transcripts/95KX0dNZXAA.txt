So I have an interesting equation here. It says v to the negative 6 5th power times the fifth root of v is equal to v to the k power, for v being greater than equal to zero. And what I wanna do is try to figure out what k needs to be. So what is k going to be equal to? So pause the video and see if you can figure out k. And I'll give you a hint. You just have to leverage some of your exponent properties. Alright, let's work this out together. So the first thing I'd wanna do is be a little bit consistent in how I write my exponent. So here I've written it as negative 6 5th power, and here I've written it as a fifth root. But we know that the fifth root of something, we know that the fifth root, the fifth root of v, that's the same thing as saying v to the 1 5th power. And the reason I wanna say that is because then I'm multiplying two different powers of the same base, two different powers of v. And so we can use our exponent properties there. So this is going to be the same thing as v to the negative 6 5ths times, instead of saying the fifth root of v, I can say times v to the 1 5th power is going to be equal to v to the k. It's going to be equal to v to the k power. Now, if I'm multiplying v to some power times v to some other power, we know what the exponent properties would tell us. And I could remind us, I'll do it over here, if I have x to the a times x to the b, that's going to be x to the a plus b power. So here I have the same base, v, so this is going to be v to the, and I can just add the exponents, v to the negative 6 5th power plus 1 5th power, or v to the negative 6 5ths plus 1 5th power is going to be equal to v to the k. Is equal to v to the k, I think you might see where this is all going now. So this is going to be equal to v. So negative 6 5ths plus 1 5th is going to be negative 5 5ths or negative 1. So all of this is going to be equal to negative 1. And that's going to be equal to v to the k. So k must be equal to negative 1. And we're done. K is equal to negative 1.
