- [David] Hello, Wordsmiths, and welcome to "Eat Your Words," the vocabulary cooking show. I'm your host David from Khan Academy. And folks, lemme tell you, we have such a wonderful
menu for this video. On the menu are essential, modify, advance, and longevity. We'll talk about what these
words mean and their word parts, and then we'll use them in some sentences. Essential is an adjective that means necessary
or extremely important. Modify is a verb, it means to change, usually to improve something. Advance, another verb,
it means to move forward, to improve or to put forward an idea. And longevity is a noun
that means long life or the quality of being long lasting. Let's talk about the
recipes for these words. What goes into them? Well, essential comes
from the Latin verb esse, meaning to be, you can see
this in both Spanish and French in the verbs estar and etre, or more obviously in the Italian essere, all of them mean to be. So something that is
essential is necessary for existing, for being. A related word in English is
essence, like the true nature or the most basic version of a thing. Modify comes from mod,
meaning manner or way. To modify something is to
change the way it works. Advance is a funny one because of that D, it actually comes from ab plus ante. So ab in Latin means from
and ante means before or in front of, so to
advance is to move forward, to go before everyone
else by being in front. So ab, not ad, meaning two. My word origin says that the D sound came
into English as a mistake, that it was written in
English as ad and not ab. It doesn't really affect the meaning, it's just a historical oddity. Ante shows up in a lot of English words. There's anticipate, which
is to wait for something that hasn't happened yet, there's ancestor, which comes
from the Latin antecesor, who has gone before you. Antecedent is a grammar term for the noun that a pronoun replaces. It's the word you said before. "I ate the apple. It was delicious." The antecedent of it is apple because I said apple first, right? I said apple before it, but both words refer to the same thing. Longevity comes from the Latin root long, which, big surprise, means
long, and eva, which means age, I'll write eva here. This second root shows
up in two English words, medieval, the middle ages, and primeval, which is the dawn of
time, prime means first. ITY, I-T-Y is a noun-forming suffix. So altogether long plus eva
plus ity equals longevity or long agedness. Now, in classic cooking show format, enough talk about recipes, here's some finished
dishes I made earlier. Let's use these words in some sentences. "I don't care what anyone says. To me, onion rings are
an essential nutrient. I need them to live." They are required for me to be, to exist. "Jeff's ankle hurt, so
he modified his pushups by resting his weight on his
knees instead of his feet." He changed the pushup to
make it better for his ankle. He modified it. "This little device will
advance medical science so much, we'll feel like we're
living in the future. If only I can convince
anyone else it works." It will move medical science forward. It will bring it into the future. It'll be a great
advancement, that MEDICUBE. "Gray parrots have
surprising longevity as pets. In the wild, they live for about 20 years. In captivity, they can
live as many as 50 years." When you yourself are old and
gray, like an aged parrot, and crowds of curious youth,
ask you, "Oh, mighty wordsmith, what is the secret to your longevity?" Say back to them, "It is
because I learned so many words. This has given me many
years of life, probably." Anyway, eat your vegetables, go outside, and most importantly, remember
that you can learn anything. David out.
