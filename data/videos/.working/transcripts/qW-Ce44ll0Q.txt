We have three different number lines here, and on each number line they mark off a couple of these marks. This is negative 2, this is negative 10, negative 5, negative 11, and then we need to figure out what the blue dot represents. And as a little bit of a hint, each mark here is not necessarily incrementing by 1. It could be by more than 1. So I encourage you to pause this video and to try it on your own, to try to figure out what number does this blue dot represent on these different number lines. So let's tackle this first one. So we're going to go where they give us this mark is negative 2, this is negative 10, and we need to figure out this blue one that's further to the left of negative 10. Well just going from negative 2 to negative 10, what has to happen to negative 2 to get to negative 10? Well we'll have to subtract 8. And so if we move 2 to the left, that's the equivalent of subtracting 8. So if we move 2 to the left again, that's subtracting 8 again. So this must be negative 18. And so if we move 2 to the left again, that also must be subtracting 8. Negative 18 minus 8 would get us to negative, that gets us to negative 26. Now another way we could have thought about it is, if we jump 2 to the left and that's negative 8, then one jump to the left is going to be negative 4. So you could say well this is negative 4, that would get you to negative 6. Then negative 4 again gets you to negative 10, then this would be negative 14, negative 18, negative 22, negative 26. Now let's tackle this one. So here we're going to have to figure out this blue dot here is on the right. So if we started at 11, if we start at 11, you make 2 jumps to go to negative 5. So what do I have to add to negative 11 to get to negative 5? Well I have to add 6. So if I add 6 over 2 jumps, that means that each of these jumps, that must be plus 3 and this one must be plus 3. So now each each mark we just add 3. So negative 5 plus 3, so plus 3 is going to get us to negative 2, plus 3 gets us to positive 1. Negative 2 plus 3 is positive 1. Plus 3 gets us to 4. So here we get to negative 26, here we get to 4. Now let's tackle this one. So we're at negative 7, or this is negative 7, this is 1, and then we figure out this mark right over here. So if you take 2 jumps to the right from negative 7 to 1, how much did we have to add? Well to get from negative 7 to 1, you have to add 8. So then if we make another 2 jumps to the mystery number, that means we added 8 again. So 1 plus 8 is 9. Another way we could have thought about it, if we added 8 over 2 jumps, that means we added 4 on each jump. So this one must be negative 3, add 4, you get to 1. Add 4, you get to 5. Add 4, you get to 9.
