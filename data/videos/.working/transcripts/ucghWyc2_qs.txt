Part C, find the average value of f on the interval negative one to one. So the average value of a function over an interval is just going to be, so let's just write average, the average value of our function is just going to be the integral over the interval, negative one to one of f of x, d of x, divided by our change in x. So divided by, sorry, this is from negative one to one, negative one to one, f of x, d of x, divided by our change in x, and our change in x is one minus negative one. So this is going to be equal to one half times the integral, and here f of x is piecewise defined. So what we can do is break up this integral into two intervals. We can say the integral of f of x from negative one to zero of f of x, dx, plus, let me just write it this way so we don't have to keep rewriting the one half. Let me write it, I'll use brackets, plus the integral from zero to one of f of x, f of x, dx. And the reason why I broke it up like this is because this function has a different definition, or it's piecewise defined. It's different when we're less than or equal to zero versus when we are greater than zero. So that's why I like to break it up this way. So then we get this is equal to one half times, and in brackets, in big brackets like this, this first part right over here, we can write as the integral from negative one to zero. What is f of x between negative one and zero? It's one minus two sine of x. One minus two sine of x, dx, and then plus this thing right over here, plus the integral from zero to one, and what is our function between zero and one? It's e to the negative four x, e to the negative four x, dx. And now we can do each of these integrals separately. And so this is going to be equal to one half, and once again, I'll do a big open bracket right over here. My pen is getting loose, let me tie on the front a little bit better. There you go. All right, back to work. So one half, open brackets, and now let's take the antiderivative of one minus two sine of x. Antiderivative of one with respect to x is just x. Negative two sine of x. Well, the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. So this is just going to be two cosine of x. And you can verify that derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. You have the two out front, so it's negative two sine of x. So we're going to evaluate that at zero and at negative one. And to that, we're going to add, so let's do this definite integral over here, the antiderivative of e to the negative four x. The antiderivative is going to be equal to negative e to the negative four x over four. And the way you realize that is if you had just an e, if this was just an e to the x, then its antiderivative would just be e to the x. If you have an e to the negative four x, then you know that whatever its antiderivative is, is going to have a, is going to be essentially an e to the negative four x. But when you take its derivative, you're going to have to take the derivative of the negative four x part because of the chain rule. And so you're going to have to have a negative four that comes out. But we don't see a negative four over here. We don't see a negative four here. So we're obviously going to have to divide by a negative four, so it cancels out. Another way to think about it is, we could have rewritten, we could have rewritten this thing. So this is equal to e to the negative four x dx. This is exactly what our problem is, what we need to take the definite integral. And so that it becomes completely clear, so that the derivative of this thing is sitting around here. We could put a negative four over here. But you can't just willy-nilly throw a negative four there. You could put, you would have to put a negative one fourth outside of it in order for it to be, in order negative one fourth times negative four, you're just multiplying by one, which doesn't change the value. And then here you'd clearly see, here you'd clearly see that this is, this right over here is the derivative of e to the negative four x. So you'd have e to the negative four x, the antiderivative of this is e to the negative four x, and then you have this negative one fourth over here. So either way, either way, hopefully that makes sense. We go into more detail of that earlier in the calculus playlist. So then this is from, we're going to evaluate it at one and at zero. Evaluate it at one and at zero. And then we want to close the brackets. And so what do we have here? This is equal to one half. Once again, open the brackets. If you evaluate all of this at zero, you get zero plus two cosine of zero. Cosine of zero is one. So you just get a two when you evaluate it at the zero. So you get a two. And then from that we want to subtract whatever we get when we evaluate it at negative one. We want to subtract negative one plus two cosine of negative one. Plus two cosine of negative one. So this whole thing right over here evaluates to this whole thing right over there. And then we have plus, we want to evaluate this at one. So this gives us negative e to the negative four. So four times one is just, or negative four x when x is one is negative four over four. And from that we need to subtract this thing evaluated at zero. We need to subtract this thing evaluated at zero. So that's going to be negative e to the zero over four. Well that's just, e to the zero is one. So that's just negative one over four. And once again, all of this is going to be multiplied by one half. And now we just have to simplify it. So this is equal to, well I'll just still throw out the one half here. This is equal to one half times, so I'll do this in a new color here. Let me do it in, well I don't have too many new colors. Okay, so this is equal to two plus one. So this and this together is going to be equal to three. And then you have this negative outside, so that's why it was a plus one. And then you have a negative times a positive two, so minus two cosine of negative one. And then you have plus, or maybe I should say minus, minus e to the negative four over four. And then you have plus one fourth. Plus one fourth. And then we want to close our brackets. And then we can do one last step of simplification here. Three, we could add the three to the one fourth. Three is the same thing as 12 over four. 12 over four plus one fourth is 13 fourths. So you have 13 fourths minus two cosine of negative one. Minus e to the negative four over four. And then of course you have your one half sitting out here. And it's not the most beautiful or simple thing, but this is our answer. This is the average value of f of x over that interval.
