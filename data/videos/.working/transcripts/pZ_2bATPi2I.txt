Let's now think about type two regions. And you'll see that they're kind of very similar definitions and it's really a question of orientation. So type two regions, type two region is a region, I'll call it R2, that's the set of all X, Ys and Zs in three dimensions such that, and now instead of thinking of our domain in terms of X, Y coordinates, we're gonna think of them in terms of Y, Z coordinates such that our Y, Z pairs are a member of some domain, I'll call it D2 since we're calling about type two regions, and X is bounded below by some function of Y, Z. So I'll call it G1 of Y, Z is less than or equal to X, which is less than or equal to some other function of Y, Z, G2 of Y, Z. And so you'll immediately see very similar way of thinking about it, but instead of having Z vary between two functions of X and Y as we had in a type one region, we now have X varying between two functions of Y and Z. Now let's think about some of the shapes we explored. We saw that these two right over here, the sphere and the cylinder were type one regions, but this dumbbell, the way that I orient it here, was not a type one region. Let's think about which of these are type two regions and what might not be a type two region. So first let's think about the sphere. So I have my axes right over here, let me scroll down a little bit. So I got my axes, and so over here our domain, we can still construct our sphere, but our domain is now going to be in the Y, Z plane. So Y, Z plane is this business right over here. So this will be our domain, I don't wanna make it more spherical than that. So our domain is this right over here in the Y, Z plane, that is our D2. And now the lower bound, in order to construct a region, the solid region of the sphere, or the globe, or whatever you wanna call it, the lower bound on X would be kind of the back half of the sphere, the one that's away from us right over here. So the lower bound, so let me see how well I can wire frame it at first, the lower bound, I can do a better job than that. So it might go through something like that, and then do something like that. But this is if the domain right over here was transparent, but all we might catch, we'll just catch a glimpse of it in the back right over here. So it's the side of the sphere that's facing away from us. And then the upper bound on X would be the side of the sphere that's facing us. So if I were to do some contours, it might look something like this, and then look something like this. And then we would color in this entire region right over here. And X can take on all the values above that magenta surface and below this green surface, and essentially it would fill up the globe for every YZ point in our domain. So a sphere is both a type one and a type two region. Actually we're gonna see it's going to be a type three region as well. What about this cylinder right over here? Can we construct it or think about it in a way that it would actually be a type two region? So let's try to do that. So let me paste it. So what if we had a domain? What if our domain was something like this? It was a rectangle in the YZ plane. So it was a rectangle in the YZ plane. So this is our domain, a rectangle in the YZ plane. So that would be my D2. And what if the lower bound was kind of the back side of the cylinder? So the back side of the cylinder, try to draw it as good as I can. The back side of the cylinder, and so if we just saw the outside of it, it would look something like that. It's facing away from us, so we barely see it. If we could see through the cylinder, or see through the little flat cut of the cylinder, it would look something like that. So that over there would be our G1, and then our G2 would be the front side of the cylinder. G2 could be the front side of the cylinder. And so let me color it in as best as I can. So G2 would be the front side of the cylinder, and X can vary above G1 and below G2, and it would fill up this entire cylinder. So we see that this same cylinder that we also saw was a type one region, can also be a type two region. Now what about this hourglass thing that we saw could not be a type one region? Can this be a type two region? Well let's think about it. Let's think about it, I'll do it the same way. We can construct a domain. So maybe our domain, it's in the Y, well it should be in the YZ plane if we're talking about type two regions, or if we want to think of it as a type two region. So our domain could be this kind of flat hourglass shape that's in the YZ plane. So our domain could be a region that looks something like this in the YZ plane. So this is kind of flattened out. So this is our domain right over there. And then the lower bound on X, G1, could be a surface, the function of Y and Z, which is kind of the back side, the back side of our hourglass. The back side of our hourglass, you could see, I'll try to show the contours from the underside right over there. So that could be our G1. And then our G2 could be the front side of the hourglass. It could be the front side of the hourglass. So my best attempt, my best attempt to draw the front side of the hourglass. And I could color it in. And so the way I somewhat confusingly drew it just now, you see that this hourglass oriented the way it is would actually be a type two region. Now, if we were to rotate it like this, so let me draw it like this. So edit. So if we were to make it like this, so that the top of my hourglass is facing us, try my best to draw it. So let's say the top intersects the X axis right over there. The top, this is the bottom of my hourglass right over there. And then it bends in and then comes back out like that. So it bends in and comes back out just like that. For the same reasons that this was not a type one region, this now would not be a type two region. For any XY, you're going to see that there's multiple points. Sorry, for any ZY, you could see there could be multiple X points that are associated with the different points of this hourglass. You can't just have a simple lower and upper bound functions right over here. So this right over here is not a type two region. You could show a rationale, or this is going to be a type one region. You could create a region over here in the XY plane and have an upper and lower bound functions for Z, so you could be type one. But this will not be type two.
