        "C": "Neurotransmitters are continuously released at a constant rate regardless of neural activity, and the action potential temporarily halts this ongoing release",
        "D": "The postsynaptic cell sends a chemical signal (a retrograde messenger such as endocannabinoids or nitric oxide) backward across the synaptic cleft that binds to receptors on the presynaptic terminal, triggering the release of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles from the presynaptic membrane into the cleft — this retrograde signaling mechanism is the primary trigger for normal synaptic transmission"

      "options": {
        "A": "Myelin increases the effective diameter of the axon by adding concentric layers of lipid membrane around the nerve fiber, which increases the cross-sectional area available for internal current flow and reduces the longitudinal resistance to ion movement — larger-diameter fibers conduct action potentials faster according to cable theory, so myelination works primarily by mimicking the effect of a thicker axon",
        "B": "Myelin acts as an electrical insulator that prevents ion leakage across the membrane, forcing the action potential to 'jump' between gaps in the myelin (nodes of Ranvier) where ion channels are concentrated — this saltatory conduction is much faster than continuous propagation",
        "C": "Myelin directly generates electrical current through piezoelectric properties of its lipid layers that push the action potential along the axon faster",
        "D": "Myelin increases the number and density of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels distributed along the entire length of the axon, rather than concentrating them at nodes — this uniform high channel density allows faster depolarization and repolarization at every point along the membrane, increasing the maximum conduction velocity achievable by the axon"

        "B": "LTP is simply an increase in the amount of neurotransmitter released, which runs out after a few minutes",
        "C": "The persistent strengthening of LTP requires new protein synthesis and structural changes at the synapse — including insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane and growth of new dendritic spines — that physically remodel the connection",

        "B": "Brain capillaries have unusually large pores (fenestrations) between their endothelial cells that passively filter out harmful substances based purely on molecular size, allowing only small molecules through while blocking larger proteins and pathogens — this size-exclusion filtration is the structural basis of the blood-brain barrier",
        "C": "Neurons secrete a chemical shield composed of specialized glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides that surrounds each neuron individually, creating a protective barrier that repels foreign molecules and prevents them from contacting the neural membrane — this pericellular chemical shield is the primary mechanism of the blood-brain barrier",

        "B": "Chloride ions accumulate inside the neuron through active Cl⁻ transport, creating a net negative intracellular charge",
        "C": "The sodium-potassium pump directly generates the $-70$ mV resting potential through its electrogenic activity, pumping 3 Na⁺ ions out of the cell for every 2 K⁺ ions pumped in — this net export of one positive charge per pump cycle creates the transmembrane voltage difference, and inhibiting the pump with ouabain immediately collapses the membrane potential to zero",

      "options": {
        "A": "Dopamine directly contracts skeletal muscles in the limbs by binding to dopamine receptors on muscle fibers and triggering calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum — loss of dopaminergic neurons therefore weakens muscles directly, explaining the bradykinesia and rigidity of Parkinson's disease as a peripheral neuromuscular deficit rather than a central nervous system disorder",
        "B": "Loss of dopaminergic input to the striatum disrupts the balance between the direct (movement-facilitating) and indirect (movement-inhibiting) pathways of the basal ganglia — the resulting excessive inhibition of the thalamus by the globus pallidus interna suppresses voluntary movement initiation",
        "C": "Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra project directly to spinal cord motor neurons via a nigroспinal pathway, and their loss physically disconnects the brain from the muscles of the limbs and trunk",
        "D": "The substantia nigra produces acetylcholine rather than dopamine, and this cholinergic output is sent directly to the motor cortex where it activates upper motor neurons — degeneration of substantia nigra neurons eliminates the cortical cholinergic drive for voluntary movement, explaining why Parkinson's patients have difficulty initiating and executing motor commands"

      "options": {
        "A": "When two neurons fire simultaneously, new axonal branches physically grow between them within minutes through rapid cytoskeletal remodeling — growth cones emerge from the presynaptic neuron's axon, extend across the neuropil, and form new synaptic contacts with the postsynaptic neuron, establishing permanent structural connections that encode the learned association",
        "B": "Neurons that fire together release a special 'wiring hormone' — a secreted neurotrophin discovered in 2015 — that permanently fuses their plasma membranes at the synaptic contact into a continuous cytoplasmic bridge (a gap junction), converting the chemical synapse into an electrical synapse with zero transmission delay",
        "C": "Simultaneous firing has no lasting effect on synaptic transmission strength — synaptic weights are determined entirely by the organism's genome during early development and remain fixed throughout adult life, which is why learning is restricted to a brief critical period in early childhood",
        "D": "The NMDA receptor acts as a coincidence detector — it opens only when the postsynaptic membrane is depolarized (relieving the Mg²⁺ block) AND glutamate is bound (presynaptic activity), allowing Ca²⁺ influx that triggers intracellular signaling cascades leading to synaptic strengthening"

        "A": "SSRIs must physically accumulate in brain tissue for several weeks before reaching pharmacologically effective concentrations — the drug molecules slowly partition from the bloodstream into the lipid-rich brain parenchyma, and the rate-limiting step is passive diffusion across the blood-brain barrier, which requires weeks of daily dosing to establish a sufficient brain tissue reservoir",

What makes this technique so much more powerful than traditional electrical stimulation for establishing causal relationships between neural activity and behavior?",

        "A": "Optogenetics uses much brighter light than electrical stimulation uses current, and this intense light penetrates deeper into brain tissue than electrical current can travel — the improved depth of penetration allows optogenetics to reach neurons in deep brain structures that electrical stimulation cannot access, and the brightness of the light provides more consistent and reliable activation of neurons regardless of their distance from the light source, making it superior for deep brain structure experiments",

        "B": "Grid cells fire exclusively at the physical boundaries and walls of an environment rather than in a periodic spatial pattern throughout the open space — the apparent hexagonal firing pattern is a misinterpretation of boundary-related activity that appears periodic only because standard experimental arenas have straight walls arranged in regular geometric shapes, and testing in irregularly shaped environments reveals that grid cell firing is confined to boundary-adjacent locations",
        "C": "Hexagonal grid patterns encode running speed information through their spatial frequency rather than position — faster running speeds produce finer hexagonal grids (smaller spacing between firing fields) while slower speeds produce coarser grids, and the grid pattern itself carries no information about the animal's current location in the environment",

        "A": "SWRs erase hippocampal memory traces by inducing widespread synaptic depression, clearing the hippocampus for new encoding the following day — disrupting SWRs should therefore improve memory by preventing this erasure process",

        "C": "SWRs are essential for memory consolidation — during ripples, hippocampal place cells replay recently experienced spatial trajectories in compressed form, and this replay is coordinated with neocortical slow oscillations and thalamocortical spindles to transfer memory traces from hippocampus to long-term neocortical storage",
