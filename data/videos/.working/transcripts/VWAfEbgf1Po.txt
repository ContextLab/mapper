On a multiple choice test, problem one has four choices and problem two has three choices. That should be choices. Each problem has only one correct answer. What is the probability of randomly guessing the correct answer on both problems? Now, the probability of guessing the correct answer on each problem, these are independent events. So let's write this down. The probability of correct on problem number one is independent, or let me write it this way. Probability of correct on number one and probability of correct on problem two are independent. Which means that the outcome of one of the events, of guessing on the first problem, isn't going to affect the probability of guessing correctly on the second problem, independent events. So the probability of guessing on both of them, so that means that the probability of being correct on guessing correct on one and number two is going to be equal to the product of these probabilities. And we're going to see why that is visually in a second. It's going to be the probability of correct on number one times the probability of being correct on number two. Now, what are each of these probabilities? On number one, there are four choices. There are four possible outcomes. And only one of them is going to be correct. Each one only has one correct answer. So the probability of being correct on problem one is 1 fourth, and then the probability of being correct on problem number two has three choices. So there's three possible outcomes, and there's only one correct one. So only one of them are correct. So probability of correct on number two is 1 third, probability of guessing correct on number one is 1 fourth. The probability of doing on both of them is going to be its product. So it's going to be equal to 1 fourth times 1 third is 1 twelfth. Now, to see kind of visually why this makes sense, let's draw a little chart here. And we did a similar thing when we thought about rolling two separate dice. So let's think about problem number one. Problem number one has four choices, only one of which is correct. So let's write, so it has four choices. So it has one, let's write incorrect choice one, incorrect choice two, incorrect choice three, and then it has the correct choice over there. So those are the four choices. They're not going to necessarily be in that order on the exam, but we can just list them in this order. Now, problem number two has three choices, only one of which is correct. So problem number two has incorrect choice one, incorrect choice two, and then let's say the third choice is correct. It's not necessarily in that order, but we know it has two incorrect and one correct choices. Now, what are all of the different possible outcomes? We can draw a little bit of a grid here. Let's draw all of the outcomes. Each of these cells or each of these boxes in a grid are a possible outcome. You're just guessing. You're randomly choosing one of these four, you're randomly choosing one of these four. So you might get incorrect choice one and incorrect choice one, incorrect choice in problem number one, and then incorrect choice in problem number two. That would be that cell right there. Maybe you get problem number one correct, but you get incorrect choice number two and problem number two. So these would represent all of the possible outcomes when you guess on each problem. And which of these outcomes represent getting correct on both? Well, getting correct on both is only this one. Correct on choice one and correct on choice on problem number two. So that's one of the possible outcomes and how many total outcomes are there? There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Out of 12 possible outcomes. Or since these are independent events, you can multiply. You see that there are 12 outcomes because there's 12 possible outcomes. So there's four possible outcomes for problem number one times the three possible outcomes for problem number two, and that's also where you get a 12.
