      "options": {
        "A": "Current measurement instruments are not precise enough to simultaneously determine both position and momentum, but future advances in detector technology will overcome this purely instrumental limitation — the uncertainty principle reflects a practical engineering barrier rather than a fundamental physical law, and quantum computing technology will eventually enable simultaneous high-precision measurements of conjugate variables",
        "B": "It is a fundamental consequence of the wave nature of quantum objects — position and momentum are related by Fourier transform, so a state well-localized in position necessarily has a broad spread in momentum, and vice versa. This is not a measurement limitation but an intrinsic property of quantum states",
        "C": "The act of measurement always disturbs the particle by transferring a random and uncontrollable amount of energy and momentum from the apparatus",
        "D": "The uncertainty principle applies only to subatomic particles (electrons, protons, photons) and has absolutely no relevance to mesoscopic or macroscopic quantum systems such as superconducting circuits, Bose-Einstein condensates, or quantum dots — once a system contains more than approximately 100 atoms, classical determinism is restored and simultaneous position-momentum measurements become possible in principle"

The apparent interference pattern reported in some experiments is an artifact of detector nonlinearity and insufficient statistical sampling",
        "B": "The electrons interact with each other across time through a retrocausal quantum correlation mechanism: each electron's trajectory is influenced by the final positions of all previously detected electrons and all future electrons that will be sent through the apparatus, creating a collective self-organizing pattern that builds up into interference fringes only when enough electrons have been accumulated",
        "C": "Each electron is literally split into two halves by the slit barrier, with one half of the electron's charge and mass passing through each slit — the two halves then recombine on the other side to produce interference, and each half carries exactly half the electron's quantum numbers until recombination occurs",
        "D": "Each electron arrives at a single point on the detector, but after many electrons, the cumulative pattern of arrivals forms an interference pattern — as if each electron's probability amplitude passed through both slits simultaneously and interfered with itself"

      "options": {
        "A": "The electron's wave function must satisfy boundary conditions — specifically, it must be single-valued, continuous, and normalizable. For the Coulomb potential, only discrete energy eigenvalues satisfy these conditions, as the wave function must vanish at infinity for bound states",
        "B": "The proton at the center of the hydrogen atom emits electromagnetic radiation only at specific discrete frequencies determined by its internal structure, and these emitted photon frequencies restrict which energy levels the electron can occupy — the electron must absorb exactly one of these proton-emitted photons to transition between levels, and since only certain photon energies are available, only certain electronic energy levels are accessible",

      "options": {
        "A": "Qubits compute fundamentally faster than classical bits because they use photons as their physical substrate instead of electrons — photons travel at the speed of light through optical fibers and free-space channels, enabling computation at light speed rather than the slower electron drift velocity in semiconductor circuits. This photonic speed advantage gives quantum computers an exponential speedup over classical computers for every computational problem, regardless of algorithmic considerations",
        "B": "Quantum parallelism — a register of $n$ qubits can simultaneously represent all $2^n$ computational basis states in superposition, and quantum gates manipulate all these states simultaneously. Combined with interference (amplifying correct answers, canceling wrong ones) and entanglement, this enables exponential speedups for specific problems like factoring and unstructured search",
        "C": "Quantum computers can solve every computational problem exponentially faster than any classical computer, without exception",
        "D": "Each qubit stores exactly two classical bits of information by encoding one bit in each of its two basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, effectively doubling the memory capacity of a quantum register compared to a classical register of the same size — a register of $n$ qubits therefore stores $2n$ classical bits, providing a linear (not exponential) improvement in storage capacity that accounts for the modest speedups observed in some quantum algorithms"

        "B": "Quantum mechanics is fundamentally an incomplete theory that will eventually be replaced by a deeper deterministic theory containing hidden variables — the statistical predictions and apparent nonlocality of quantum mechanics are artifacts of our ignorance of these underlying deterministic variables, and once they are discovered, all quantum phenomena including entanglement will be explained by classical physics extended with additional local parameters",

This size-dependent crossover is built into the fundamental structure of quantum theory, and the Schrödinger equation itself becomes invalid for systems larger than this critical length scale",

        "B": "The physical measuring apparatus creates a potential energy barrier that blocks the decay products from escaping the quantum system — each time a measurement is performed, the apparatus exerts a short-range force on the system that confines the decay products to the vicinity of the parent state, and with sufficiently frequent measurements, this confinement force maintains the system in its initial undecayed state indefinitely",

The 'topological' label refers to the toroidal geometry of the cryostat in which these ultra-cold qubits are housed, not to any mathematical property of the quantum states themselves",
        "B": "Topological qubits use physically larger particles (such as entire molecules or nanoparticles) as their information carriers instead of the single atoms, electrons, or photons used in conventional quantum computing — these larger particles have more internal degrees of freedom that can absorb perturbations without affecting the encoded quantum information, providing an error-correcting buffer analogous to the thermal mass of a large object that resists temperature changes",
        "C": "Topological qubits are protected by an exceptionally large energy gap between the ground state and all excited states of the physical system — this gap is much larger than the energy gaps in conventional superconducting qubits, and it prevents any thermal or electromagnetic perturbation from exciting the system out of its computational basis states.
