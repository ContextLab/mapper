Hello, your highness. Hello. What can I do for you? Well, Sal, I'm having a problem. I have a party tomorrow, and I would like to have 18 monkeys, but I only have 10. Well, let me see if I can count that. You have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 monkeys. Yep, you're right. You only have 10. Exactly. That's what I just told you. But how many more monkeys do I need if I want to get to 18? Well, maybe our friends who are listening or watching could figure that out on their own. How many monkeys would the queen need now that she has 10 monkeys? How many more would she need in order to have 18? I'm assuming our friends have had a go at it, so let's think about this together. Let's see. Let's think about how many more monkeys to get to 18. If we have one more monkey, one more monkey is going to get us to 11. Then another one is going to get us to 12. Then another one is going to get us to 13. Let's keep doing that. 14, almost there. 15, let me write that down. 15, and then 16, 16, and then 17, 17, and then 18. Whoops. And then 18 monkeys. That's our goal. We wanted to get to 18. So how many did we add? Let's think about this. We had 10 before, so all of these up here. These are 10 monkeys. Let's see. That is 10 monkeys right over there. Then we added one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So we added eight monkeys to those 10. So we added eight in order to get to 18. Or another way to think about it, 18 is the same thing is equal to 10 plus eight. Thank you so much. I can now have a sufficient number of monkeys at my potty. No, thank you. It's always a pleasure to help you, queen. I'm noticing an interesting pattern right over here. Notice, 18 is 10 plus eight. I wonder if that's a pattern in general. So if I had, say, let's say we had 10. Let's say we had the number 10. The number 10 by itself, that's the same thing as 10. This is 110 right over here plus zero ones. So it's 110 plus zero ones. The number 11 is equal to 110. So this one right over here represents a 10, and then this one represents one more one. So plus one. And just like that, we could keep going. And I encourage our friend listening to try this on our own. Look at all of the numbers. Keep counting from 10, 11, all the way up to, you could count all the way up to 19, and see this pattern. Notice, 18, this one right over here, it represents one 10. And then this eight over here represents eight. So when we say, if we start with 10, how much do we have to add to get to 18? Well, the 10 is this one here, so we need eight more ones. 10 plus 8 is 18. Oh, thank you so much, Sal. Not only will I have enough pop monkeys at my party, I now know a little bit more about mathematics. Oh, you're very welcome, Queen.
