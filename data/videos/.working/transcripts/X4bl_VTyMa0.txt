Welcome teachers for this short guided meditation. Remind yourself that meditation, there's no right way to do it. It's just an opportunity to still your mind, take a break from all the thoughts that you normally have, the planning, the to-dos of the future, thoughts of the past, and just be in the moment and be still. So let's start by taking a few deep and controlled breaths together, in through our nose, hold, and out through our mouths, in through our nose, hold, and then out through your mouth. Now I encourage you to continue to breathe in a deep and controlled way, but as you do so, try to put a smile on your face. It might feel a little artificial, but I promise it'll actually feel good, even if your mood might not have made you want to smile. Just put a big cheesy smile on your face as you continue to breathe in, and out. So as you go through the rest of your day, I encourage you to take breaks like this, moment of pause, moment of stillness, approached with a sense of acceptance, a sense of curiosity, even a sense of humor, and remind yourself that as a teacher, you give so much of yourself to others, but you need to have a source of energy, and so for their sake, it's important that you take care of yourself. It's important that you give your mind a break and be in the moment, in a moment of stillness and acceptance, and maybe in a little way resolve and refresh everything that's going on to tackle the day, the weeks, the months ahead. Thank you.
