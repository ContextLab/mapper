We're asked which value for d, we see d in this equation here, makes x equals negative three an extraneous solution for this radical equation. Square root of three x plus 25 is equal to d plus two x. And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it on your own before we work through it together. All right, now let's work through this together. So the first thing to just remind ourselves is what is an extraneous solution? Well that's a solution that we get before we think we get, but it's really just a byproduct of how we solved it, but it isn't going to be an actual solution of our original equation. Now how do these extraneous solutions pop up? Well, it pops up when you take the square of both sides. So for this equation right over here, to get rid of the radical, I'd want to square both sides of it. If I square both sides, the left-hand side will become three x plus 25, and the right-hand side, if I square this, is going to be what? It's going to be d squared plus four, four d x plus x squared. So that's just squaring both sides of this. But notice, there's actually a different equation than this one that if you squared both sides, you would also get this. What is that different equation? Well the different equation is if you took the negative of one of these sides. So for example, if you started the original equation, the negative square root of three x plus 25 is equal to d plus two x. You square both sides of this, you still get this purple equation. Because you square a negative, you get a positive. So both of them, when you square both sides, get us over here. And so when you solve this purple equation, this is a quadratic right over here, you just rearrange it a little bit, you get it in the standard quadratic form, you'll get two solutions. And it turns out one of the solutions is going to be for this yellow equation, and one of the solutions is going to be for the purple equation. And if the solution that is for the purple equation is going to be an extraneous solution for the yellow equation. It's actually not going to be a solution for the yellow equation. So when they say which value for d makes x equals negative three an extraneous solution for this yellow equation, that's the same thing as saying what value of d makes x equals negative three a solution for this? So a solution, a solution for this. If it's a solution for this, it's going to be an extraneous solution for that, because these are two different equations. We have, this is, we're taking the negative of just one side of this equation to get this one. If you took the negative of both sides of this, then that becomes the same thing, because you can multiply both sides of an equation times a negative value. So a solution for this, which is equivalently a solution, which is equivalent to a solution if I, instead of putting the negative on the left-hand side, if I multiply the right-hand side by the negative. But anyway, let's think about which value for d makes x equals negative three a solution for this? Well, let's substitute x equals negative three here, and then we just have to solve for d. If x equals negative three, this is going to be negative the square root of three times negative three is negative nine plus 25 is equal to d, two times negative three is negative six. So d minus six. And so now we can square both sides of, we can square, actually let's do it this way. We can, I don't wanna square both sides because we lose some information. There's gonna be the negative square root of negative nine plus 25 is 16 is equal to d minus six. So this is going to be equal to the neg, this is going to be equal to negative four. Principle root of 16 is four, we have the negative out front, is equal to d minus six, and then add six to both sides, you get two is equal to two is equal to d. So if d is equal to two here, if d is equal to two, then a solution to this purple equation is going to be x equals negative three. And so that would be an extraneous solution because if x equals negative three satisfies this over here, it's definitely gonna satisfy this over here, but it's not going to satisfy this up here. And you can verify this, if this is equal to two, try out x equals negative three. You're gonna get, on the left hand side, you're going to get 16, and on the right hand side, you're gonna get two minus six, which is equal to negative four. Two minus six, which is negative four, so this does not work out. X equals negative three is not a solution to this, but it is a solution for this, and it is a solution to this quadratic right over here. So d equals two makes x equal negative three an extraneous solution for this equation.
