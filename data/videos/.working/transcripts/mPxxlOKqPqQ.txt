We're told consider the exponential function f, where f of x is equal to three times one half to the x power. And now they ask us several questions about the y-intercept of f, the common ratio of f, and what is the equation of the asymptote of f. So pause this video and see if you can figure these out before we do them together. All right, so first, what is the y-intercept of f? So one way to think about it is, what y value, if you were to graph it, if you were to say that y is equal to f of x, or another way to think about it, what values does the function take on when x is equal to zero? So another way to think about it, f of zero is going to be equal to three times one half to the zero. One half to the zero power is just one, so it's just three times one, it's equal to three. So the y-intercept of f is three. Why do we call that the y-intercept? Because if you were to graph y equals f of x, when x equals zero, whatever the value of the function is, it's going to be intersecting the x, sorry, it's going to be intersecting the y-axis at that point. What is the common ratio of f? So if we're dealing with an exponential function like this, it's the thing that keeps repeatedly getting multiplied, or another way to think of the thing that you're taking the exponent of, and in this situation, that is one half. And so our common ratio is one half. Now what is the equation of the asymptote of f? So one way to think about an asymptote is, does f approach, but not quite reach some value as x gets very large, or as x becomes very, very negative? Is it becomes very positive, or it becomes very negative? So let's think about this scenario here. If x becomes very positive, so if I were to say, take f of, I don't know, 20, that's three times one half to the 20th power. You might realize if I took one half and I multiplied it 20 times, you're going to get a very, very, very small number. It's going to be approaching zero, but not quite getting to zero. You multiply it by three, it'll be three times bigger, but it's still going to get very small. And this is just when x equals 20. If x equals 30, 40, 100, you're going to get closer and closer to zero, because you're taking a number between zero and one. And when every time you multiply it, you're getting smaller and smaller and smaller. So if you take it to the 20th power, 30th power, 100th power, you're getting closer and closer to zero without actually equaling zero. So as x gets bigger, our function is approaching y is equal to zero. So we could say y is equal to zero. If we go the other way, if we said f of negative 20, this is the same thing as three times 1 1 by 2 to the negative 20. Or we could say the same thing as three times, we could take the reciprocal here and get rid of this negative on the exponent, three times two over one, or I could even just say two to the 20th power. I don't even need this parentheses. Well, the parentheses are good still. Now this is going to be a very large number. So it's not really approaching anything. Some people would say it's approaching infinity, but it's not really, as x gets more and more negative, there doesn't seem to be an asymptote there, but as x becomes more and more positive, it looks like our function is approaching y equals zero. It's getting closer and closer to zero without quite reaching it. Let's do another example here. So here we are asked, which exponential function has a y-intercept of 4.5? Pause this video and try to figure that out. So as I said, the y-intercept is the value that the function takes on when x equals zero. So let's just try it out here. F of zero in this situation, when x is zero, this is all going to be one times a negative. So this is negative one. So not a y-intercept of 4.5, rule that one out. So g of zero right over here is going to be 4.5 times two to the zero, which is one, which is equal to 4.5. I like this one. I will fill it in. Now let's just double check this one. H of zero is equal to three times 4.5 to the zero power, three times one, which is equal to three. So that is not a y-intercept of 4.5. So I'll rule that one out as well.
