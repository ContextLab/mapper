Calculate the pH at the half equivalence point. So let's just remind ourselves what the half equivalence point even is. The equivalence point is when the Ti trend, in this case the hydrochloric acid, completely reacts with the potassium sorbate, the thing that we are titrating. Now the half equivalence point is the point at which half of the potassium sorbate has been converted to the sorbic acid. Or another way of thinking about it is the concentrations of the potassium sorbate and the sorbic acid are equivalent. Well how do we relate that to pH? And what other information have they given us to actually solve this? And a good thing to do whenever you are, if you feel a little bit stuck here, say well what other information have they given us? Well they gave us the Ka of sorbic acid as being 1.7 times 10 to the negative fifth. So somehow can we connect the Ka of sorbic acid to the pH at the half equivalence point? Well the other thing that they give you is they give you a whole series of formulas. In fact they give you all the formulas that I'm using here at the first couple of pages of the free response section. And even a whole bunch of formulas on equilibria and on all of these different notations they use. And the one that might show up that looks interesting is this one right over here that you might recognize as the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. And it's actually not hard to prove it, it comes straight out of the definition of Ka and then rearranging things and then taking the negative log of both sides and doing things like that. I'd encourage you to watch those videos on Khan Academy if you are curious. But what's neat here is it connects pH, it connects pH to pKa and the concentrations of an acid and its conjugate base. So how do we make a relationship here? At the half equivalence point the acid and the conjugate base their concentrations are going to be equivalent. So this and this are going to cancel out, you're just going to get one. And log of one is just going to be zero. So at the half equivalence point the pH is going to be equal to the pKa. And so what is the pKa here? Well they told us that the Ka, the Ka is equal to, and this is the Ka of sorbic acid. Ka of sorbic acid is 1.7 times 10 to the negative fifth. 1.7 times 10 to the negative fifth. 1.7 times 10 to the negative fifth. And once again when we're thinking about Ka we're thinking about the disassociation constant for the acid. And so that's why we used sorbic acid there. And either way these two concentrations are going to be the same. And if I want to find the pKa I take the negative log of, I take the negative log of this. So pKa which is equal to the negative log base 10 of the Ka, and they actually give you all of these formulas on the first page. This is going to be equal to the negative log base 10 of 1.7 times 10 to the negative fifth power. And what is that going to be? Let me get a calculator out. So let's see, I'll write 1.7, these two capital E's, that's times 10 to the, so times 10 to the, not the fifth, the negative fifth power. Now I want to take log base 10, that's this button here. If your calculator just has a log button that's going to be, that defaults to base 10. So I'll take log base 10 of that, and then I want to take the negative of that. And so this is going to be approximately 4.77. So this is approximately, approximately 4.77. So the pH, pH is equal to the pKa, which is equal to that, right over there.
