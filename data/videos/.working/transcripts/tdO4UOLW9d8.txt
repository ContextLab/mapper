Simplify n squared r to the fifth, n to the negative seventh. Express your answer in exponential form with positive exponents. Let me just rewrite what they have up there. So we have n squared r to the fifth, n to the negative seventh. So the easiest way to simplify this, I would say just while we're multiplying them, group the common bases. So we have two exponent expressions with n as a base. We have n squared and we have n to the negative seventh. Let me just rearrange this multiplication right here. I could rewrite this as n squared n to the negative seven, and then we have r to the fifth. And what's this going to be equal to? Well, we have n squared times n to the negative seventh. We can add those two exponents. So this right here would simplify to n to the 2 minus 7. 2 minus 7 is negative 5. n to the negative 5, r to the fifth. Now, we've simplified this about as much as we can, but we're not done yet. Because they said express your answer in exponential form with positive exponents. This is a negative exponent here. This is not acceptable, at least based on what they asked us to do. So we know that n to the negative fifth is the same thing as 1 over n to the fifth. So we can just rewrite it that way. So this is the same thing. That right there is 1 over n to the fifth times r to the fifth, or we could say this is equal to r to the fifth over n to the fifth. This is about as simple as you can get. If you wanted to do other things here, you could say that this is equal to r over n to the fifth, since both of these are being raised to the fifth power. But this is probably what they want here. We've simplified it, and all of the exponents are now positive, because we put the n in the denominator.
