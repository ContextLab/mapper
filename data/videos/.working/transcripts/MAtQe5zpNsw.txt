I'm here with Ben Eater. What do you do here at Khan Academy? Oh, I've done a lot of things. I've been here for a while. So when I first started at Khan Academy, I was working a lot on the exercise content. Made many of the math exercises that are on the site today. And then from that, kind of shifted into a software development role, really trying to scale our ability to do that. And so the exercise side, for those of you who've been using exercises for many years now, you wrote some of the software that created a lot of them. Yeah, well, it actually started with you. When you first started with Khan Academy, the exercises were things that you wrote as little JavaScript things that generated questions. And that carried on until very recently. And so a lot of the work that I did was building more of these question generators that could generate infinitely many problems so that folks could get as much practice as they needed. So I built many of those kind of following in your footsteps there. And then more recently, we were looking at how to expand that because I'm one person. It's kind of hard to build a lot of those. We were trying to find more people that could do that, but it required this skill set that was actually very difficult for us to find of software developers who were also good designers and good teachers. And we were looking to sort of scale that. So more recently, I was working on building software to allow non-technical folks to write questions. And so about a year ago, I worked on that. And built out a little bit of team around that. And those tools have now led to the fact we have 150,000 exercises or something like that. Yeah, it's grown pretty significantly since then. And the quality is much better than what I was building. Because we have actual teachers building this, not folks like me. Not robots. Robots. You're not building robots to write the questions. Right, right, exactly. Yeah, there's actually some thought going into each one. It's not this machine-generated thing that has this algorithm behind it. Yeah, and so from that, I am now an engineering manager working with a team of engineers to build those things and many of the things that are on the site. And what does an engineering manager do? It's a lot of things. So there's the, I guess probably the most important part of my job is ensuring that the engineers that are on the team are happy and productive. You mentioned that a big part of your job is, you know, the engineers are incredibly creative folks and kind of making sure that they're, how does that, what does that mean on a day-to-day basis? What are some of the things that you do with team members to make sure that happens? Yeah, day-to-day, talking to them a lot. They're humans, they have a lot of thoughts. And just understanding, you know, being empathetic to their personal goals and their personal needs and their thoughts about the things that they're building. I mean, there are, what, 80 people at Khan Academy now? And we're growing, you know, the odds that me or you or any other manager at Khan Academy has the best idea are, you know, one out of 80, because there are 80 people here. Like, most of the ideas are not going to be ideas that I have or that you have. They're going to be ideas that come from elsewhere in the organization. Making sure that, you know, I'm listening to the folks on my team. And for me, you know, that means, you know, spending at least an hour every week with everyone on my team one-on-one, just having a conversation about, you know, what's on their mind, what their career goals are, what just sort of, you know, kind of picking their brain and making sure they're doing okay, making sure they're happy. And this is, you know, when you imagine, when you're, at least for when I was young, and I imagine what a manager does, I imagine someone who's like telling people what to do, do this, do that. This is very different than what you're describing. Yeah, yeah, people don't like to be told what to do. I know I don't. And we hire really smart people. And so like, if I told them what to do, they would probably not do something as valuable as what they would do if we gave them a little bit more autonomy. And so, you know, a lot of it is helping, making sure that people are well aligned with our mission. And I think most people to come here are. It's a great mission to be aligned with. But I think, you know, if folks understand, you know, our strategy here and what we're driving towards, you know, giving them kind of the freedom and the flexibility and the autonomy to kind of build the things that they think are gonna be most valuable. Yeah, we've thought about even renaming manager to supporter because it really is about empowering. Yeah, I mean, most of my job is figuring out what's blocking people from being productive and trying to remove those blocks. Yeah, and even just as you just mentioned, like the great ideas aren't gonna come from necessarily, you know, the hierarchy. It's gonna come from anywhere in the organization. Sure, sure. How you surface them. Yeah, and we collectively have thought a lot about how to do that. And, you know, we have this process in place where anyone in the organization can put together proposals. You know, a lot of organizations probably have something like that, a little suggestion box or something. We take it very seriously. And we want to encourage folks to submit their ideas and to work on those projects. And, you know, so part of my job as a manager is really as a coach to help people do that. So there are folks who want to, you know, have an idea, they want to, you know, surface that and, you know, kind of push NudgeCon Academy in that direction, perhaps, and they're really passionate about it. We want them working on that thing that they're really passionate about because that's where we're gonna see them, you know, really add tons of value to Khan Academy, tons of value to our learners. And so my job as kind of a manager, as a kind of a coach, is to help them do that. And maybe they don't have the experience of like writing a proposal. You know, maybe if they didn't come from a startup where they had to write proposals and pitch investors, you know, that's a little bit intimidating for them to write a proposal and, you know, pitch you on this idea that they have. I'm very intimidating. I try to, I work on that. Yeah, well. Maximize my intimidation. But you know what I mean. I mean, you do. Putting together this proposal and trying to pitch it to, you know, where senior people of the organization can be intimidating. And as kind of a manager, as kind of a coach, helping people, you know, you know, giving them feedback on their ideas, helping them craft that document if they want. You know, I can sit down and work side by side with them to write that kind of proposal. So really helping people, making sure that we are, you know, getting as much out of each individual's abilities as we can. You know, you have a pretty interesting story about how you discovered Khan Academy. As much of that as you would like to share. That goes back a ways. I mean, we go back to when I was in school, I didn't have a great time in school. I actually didn't do particularly well in school at all. You know, I always got kind of C's and B's and C's, mostly C grades in school. And you know, kind of had this sort of negative experience, I guess, with the education system. Didn't really think much of it. And you know, I did go to college, but didn't do particularly well. Ended up, you know, failing some classes. Ended up failing out of college. And you know, just kind of never quite understood why, because I felt like I was a smart person, but you know, somehow the system had just kind of not worked for me. And the kind of, you know, system kind of failed me. But I was lucky in a sense, because this was in the mid 90s, and I had a lot of sort of technical background. My hobby was, you know, playing with computers and things like that. In the mid 90s, with a dot com boom, it was pretty easy to go out and get a job, even without having that credential from a school. And so I was able to kind of start a career. In some ways you were atypical. I mean, you were sitting there building computers in your garage when you were in high school. Yeah, I mean, I was lucky in the sense that, you know, my grades were really not that great. And I kind of credit my parents, they may not have intended this, but they kind of still gave me that space. They saw that I was like doing kind of, I was doing, you know, things like building computers in my garage. And they kind of let me do that, instead of like pushing me on my grades more. And I'm really glad that that happened because I was able to learn, or teach myself a lot. This is before the internet, so it was a little harder to do that. But yeah, but then, you know, that experience did allow me to, you know, to go into the workforce, which made a lot more sense to me, coming out of school and, or coming out of, failing out of school, and build a career kind of doing things with computers, in the networking industry and software industry. And how did you first discover Conakat? I mean, you created actually a pretty robust career in the networking industry. Yeah, yeah. How did you stumble on Conakat? Yeah, so I was working in the networking industry and then ended up, you know, starting my own company in the networking industry and build a network performance measurement product. And as I was talking to customers, I was having some difficulty explaining the value of my product because my customers didn't have as good a grasp on statistics, you know, as I had hoped. And so in order to sort of understand the value of my product, I had to kind of explain some basic statistics to them. And I was having some difficulty like explaining to my customers what a Poisson process, for example, was. So I was Googling, you know, how do I explain what a Poisson process was? And I found when I came across this video that you had made. I remember that video. Yeah, it was very good. And I was like, wow, this guy is really very clear explanations. You know, he seems to really understand how to teach well, which was something that was, you know, important to me because as I said, you know, school had always been this sort of weird thing for me. I never felt like I did particularly well. And I was always curious why the system didn't work as well as it could. And so I found this video and I thought, wow, this guy is really doing some groundbreaking stuff. And I checked out the website and I was like, oh, this is really interesting. And started going through a lot of the stuff on the website. And I realized, you know, I taught myself a lot of math in the intervening years, but I hadn't really quite understood why I didn't do well in school. You know, I was getting Bs and Cs in math. And then eventually when I got to calculus, it's kind of as it happens with many people, kind of hit the wall and started failing. I failed calculus, I think, I took it three or four times and failed at each of those times. And I never quite understood why because I felt like I understood the concepts. But then when they would give me a problem to do, you know, I fell short. And what I realized actually many years later when I discovered Khan Academy was there were these, you know, as you call them Swiss cheese gaps in my knowledge or things that I should have learned back in eighth grade that I just didn't know. And, you know, when I was expected to apply them in calculus, it wasn't the calculus that was tripping me up. It was these things from eighth grade that was tripping me up. And so I discovered that on Khan Academy and kind of went through literally all the content that you had back then, it was about almost four years ago and thought, well, this is amazing. And as I was going through that, I found a small little bug on the website and reported the bug. And it took me to at the time, I think a lot of the website was open source. And so I was able to actually look at the source code and fix the bug. And so I submitted a patch and you guys accepted it. And then I got a little bit more involved and started submitting larger. The patch is like a suggested code change. Yeah, code change. So I found the bug, fixed the bug and then submitted that fix to you guys. And then I started working on some other things. I started adding some content for you guys to add. And I guess you guys liked it. I got some emails and then eventually you called me. Which was kind of a surreal experience for me. And I felt like I... Well, when we saw, I mean, you submitted the derivative, it's still on our site, derivative intuition, which we said this person has deep understanding of calculus. Hey, you didn't suspect that I'd failed it for that. But it goes to show, you actually clearly do have deep understanding of calculus amongst many other things. You're now making videos on how semiconductors and transistors and whatever else works. And anyone who watches those would recognize your deep understanding. But it was one of these things that you had, I think what you said it was negative exponents that was tripping you up. Yeah, negative exponent rules. Exponent rules. And if you just had that gap built, you would have probably aced calculus and maybe become a math professor or something. Yeah, I mean, this is weird as the, like I understood what derivative was. I knew how to apply the power rule. But then as soon as you asked me, what's the derivative of one over X? No idea what to do. You're like, man, how does this apply? The power rule doesn't apply to that. Well, I'm glad you've taken this. And what kind of gets you up in the morning? What are you excited about? Khan Academy, what you're doing? I mean, obviously just super passionate about the mission. For me, it's a very personal visceral thing because as the story we just talked about, I felt like school had failed me in some way. And it very much goes to that Swiss cheese gaps. Whatever that day I missed in eighth grade negative exponents that just kept following me. And I had no idea how to solve that. I had a fantastic math teacher actually in high school. Learned a ton from him, but he wasn't really equipped to diagnose that problem that years early, right, missed this concept. And so I learned a ton in his class and learned a lot from math, but also he was giving me Cs. Couldn't do the work. Yeah, and so knowing that we are creating this resource that if it had existed back then would have completely removed those obstacles from me is very meaningful to me. I feel like I got very lucky based on just sort of my experience with the tinkering that I had done and the applicability and the ease of being able to get a job and at the peak of the dot com boom without an education. That was very lucky, I think. And I think most folks might not have that luck. And so knowing that we're building something that is gonna help a lot of folks who could very understandably be in that situation and not get as lucky as I did is very meaningful. That gets me up. Yeah, no, well, it's an honor to work with you. Likewise.
