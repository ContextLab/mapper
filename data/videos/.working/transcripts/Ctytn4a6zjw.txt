Let's say that you know your probability of making a free throw. You know that the probability, the probability, and let's say the probability of scoring a free throw, just because if I say make and miss they both start with M and it'll get confusing. So let's say the probability of scoring, score, you know, free throw, is equal to, is going to be, let's say 70%. If we want to write it as a percent, or we could write it as 0.7 if we write it as a decimal. And let's say the probability of missing a free throw then, and this is just gonna come straight out of what we just wrote down, so the probability of missing a free throw is just going to be 100% minus this. You're either gonna make or miss, you're either gonna score or miss. I don't wanna use make and miss because they both start with M. So this is going to be a 30% probability, or if we write it as a decimal, 0.3, 1 minus 0.7. These are the only two possibilities, so they have to add up to 100%, or they have to add up to one. Now let's say that you're going to take six attempts, and what we're curious about, what we're curious about is the probability of exactly, exactly two scores, two scores in six attempts. So let's think about what that is, and I encourage you, if you get inspired at any point in this video, you should pause it and you should try to work through what we're asking right now. So this is what we wanna figure out. The probability of exactly two scores in six attempts. So let's think about the particular ways of getting two scores in six attempts, and think about the probability for any one of those particular ways, and then we can think about, well, how many ways can we get two scores in six attempts? So for example, you could get, you could make the first two free throws, so it could be score, score, and then you miss the next four. So score, score, and then it's miss, miss, miss, and miss. So what's the probability of this exact thing happening, this exact thing? Well, you have a 0.7 chance of scoring on the first one, then you have a 0.7 chance of scoring on the second one, and then you have a 0.3 chance of missing the next four. So the probability of this exact circumstance is going to be what I'm writing down, and hopefully you don't get the multiplication symbols confused with the decimals, I'm trying to write them a little bit higher. So times 0.3, and what is this going to be equal to? Well, this is going to be equal to, this is going to be 0.7 squared times 0.3 times 0.3 to the 1, 2, 3, 4th to the 4th power. Now, is this the only way to get two scores in six attempts? No, there's many ways of getting two scores in six attempts. For example, maybe you miss the first one, the first attempt, and then you make the second attempt, you score, then you miss the third attempt, and then you, let's say you make the fourth attempt, and then you miss the next two. So then you miss, and you miss. This is another way to get two scores in six attempts, and what's the probability of this happening? Well, as we'll see, it's going to be exactly this, it's just we're multiplying in different order. This is going to be 0.3 times 0.7, you have a 30% chance of missing the first one, a 70% chance of making the second one, and then times 0.3, 30% chance of missing the third, times the 70% chance of making the fourth, times a 30% chance for each of the next two misses. If you wanted this exact circumstance, this is once again going to be 0.7, if you just rearrange the order in which you're multiplying, this is going to be 0.7 squared times 0.3 to the fourth power. So for any one of these particular ways to get exactly two scores in six attempts, the probability is going to be this. So the probability of getting exactly two scores in six attempts, well, it's going to be any one of these probabilities times the number of ways you can get two scores in six attempts. Well, if you have out of six attempts, you're choosing two of them to have scores, how many ways are there? Well, as you could imagine, this is a combinatorics problem. So you could write this as, you could write this, and let me see how I could, you're gonna take six attempts, so you could write this as six choose, or we're trying to, if you're picking from six things, you're six attempts, and you're picking two of them, or two of them are going to be, are going to be made if you want to make, meet these circumstances. This is gonna tell us the number of different ways you can make two scores in six attempts, and of course we can write this in kind of the binomial coefficient notation. We could write this as six choose two, six choose two, and we could just apply the formula for combinations. And if this looks completely unfamiliar, I encourage you to look up combinations on Khan Academy, and we go into some detail on the reasoning behind this formula, it actually makes a lot of sense. This is going to be equal to six factorial over two factorial, over two factorial, times six minus two factorial. So six minus two, six minus two factorial. I'll do the factorial in green again. Six minus two factorial, what's this going to be equal to? This is going to be equal to six times five, times four, times three, times two, and I'll just throw in the one there, although it doesn't change the value, over two times one, over two times one, and six minus two is four, so that's going to be four factorial. So this right over here is four factorial, so times four times three, times two, times one. Well that and that is going to cancel, and then let's see, six divided by two is three, so this is 15. There's 15 different ways that you could get, that you could pick two things out of six, I guess is one way to say it, or there's 15, did I say 16? There's 15, the sixes and the fives. There's 15 different ways that you could pick two things out of six, or another way of thinking about it is, there's 15 different ways to make two out of six free throws. Now, the probability for each of those is this right over here. So the probability of exactly two scores and six attempts, well this is where we deserve a little bit of a drum roll, this is going to be, this is going to be six choose two, times 0.7 squared, this is two, you're gonna make two, you're gonna make two, and then it's 0.3 to the 4th power. Notice these will necessarily add up to six. So this right over here was a three, then this right over here would be a three, and then this would be six minus three, or three right over here. And now what is this value? Well, it's going to be equal to, it's going to be equal to, we have our 15, three times five, so we have this business right over here, it's going to be 15 times, times, let's see, in yellow, 0.7 times 0.7 is going to be times 0.49. And let's see, three to the 4th power would be 81, three to the 4th power would be 81, but I'm multiplying four decimals, each of them have one space to the right of the decimal point, so I'm gonna have four spaces to the right of the decimal, so 0.0081. So there you go, whatever this number is, and actually I might as well get a calculator out and calculate it, so this is going to be, this is going to be, let me, so it's 15 times 0.49, times 0.0081, 0.0081, and we get 0.59535. So this is going to be equal to, let me write it down, and actually maybe I'll, well, I wish I had a little bit more real estate right over here, but I'll write it in a very bold color. This is going to be, oh, actually I'm kind of out of bold colors, I'll write it in a slightly less bold color, this is going to be equal to 0.05935 if we wanted the exact number, or we could say this is approximately, if we round to the nearest percentage, this is approximately a 6% chance, 6% probability of getting exactly two scores in the six attempts. I didn't say two or more, I just said exactly two scores in the six attempts, and actually it's a fairly low probability because I have a pretty high free throw percentage. If someone has this high of a free throw percentage, it's actually reasonably unlikely that they're only going to make two scores in the six attempts.
