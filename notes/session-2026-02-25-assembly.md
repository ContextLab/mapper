# Session Notes: Assembly & Status — 2026-02-25

## CORRECTED STATUS (after full audit)

Previous session notes were out of date. A full audit of all domain JSON files
revealed that background agents completed far more work than was tracked.

## All 42 Sub-Domains: COMPLETE (50 questions each, correct pipeline format)
Every sub-domain has 50 questions with: source_article, options {A,B,C,D},
slot-based correct_answer, domain_ids, concepts_tested.

Assembled from batch files this session (19 domains):
- european-history, asian-history, algorithms, theory-of-computation
- artificial-intelligence-ml, clinical-psychology, cognitive-psychology
- computational-linguistics, criminology, developmental-psychology
- forensic-archaeology, logic, metaphysics, philosophy-of-mind
- political-sociology, prehistoric-archaeology, semantics
- social-psychology, syntax

Already had valid pipeline questions (from previous sessions):
- biology, calculus, linear-algebra, ethics, macroeconomics
- number-theory, probability-statistics, neurobiology
- european-art-history, chinese-art-history, astrophysics
- us-history, microeconomics, and all original 12 sub-domains

Commit: 1d2c3c0 — pushed to generate-astrophysics-questions branch

## Parent Domain Progress (this session)

### Concepts files: ALL 8 COMPLETE
Created data/domains/.working/{domain}-concepts.json for:
- world-history, computer-science, economics, philosophy
- linguistics, sociology, psychology, archaeology
Each has 50 concepts (13 L1, 13 L2, 12 L3, 12 L4), avoiding overlap with children.

### Wave 1: Question generation — ALL 4 DOMAINS ASSEMBLED
All 20 batch agents completed. All 4 domains assembled (50 questions each):
- **world-history**: ASSEMBLED ✓ (50 questions, 13/13/12/12 difficulty distribution)
- **computer-science**: ASSEMBLED ✓ (50 questions, 13/13/12/12)
  - ⚠️ CAVEAT: Batch 1 was generated by a generic agent, NOT the /generate-questions skill.
    User wants batch 1 regenerated using the skill next session. The current batch 1
    file exists and was assembled, but should be replaced then CS re-assembled.
- **economics**: ASSEMBLED ✓ (50 questions, 13/13/12/12)
- **philosophy**: ASSEMBLED ✓ (50 questions, 13/13/12/12)

### Wave 2: NOT YET LAUNCHED (20 agents needed)
Still need 5 batch agents each for:
- linguistics
- sociology
- psychology
- archaeology
Concepts files already exist in .working/ for all 4.

## WHEN RESUMING — IMMEDIATE STEPS:
1. **Regenerate CS batch 1** using `/generate-questions` skill (concepts 0-9, L1 difficulty 1)
   Then re-assemble computer-science domain.
2. **Launch wave 2**: 5 batch agents each for linguistics, sociology, psychology, archaeology
   (use /generate-questions skill for all batches)
3. Assemble wave 2 domains as batches complete
4. After all 8 parent domains assembled, tackle the "all" domain

## "all" domain (LAST):
- Currently has 949 questions but only covers 19 of 42 sub-domains
- Needs rebuild to include questions from all 42 sub-domains + 8 parent domains
- ALSO needs its own unique concepts + questions covering topics NOT already
  covered by child domains or grandchild sub-domains (i.e., interdisciplinary
  or general-knowledge questions that don't fit neatly into any specific domain)

## Overall Progress
- **Sub-domains complete**: 42/42 (2,100 questions total)
- **Parent domain concepts**: 8/8 complete
- **Parent domain questions (wave 1)**: 4/4 ASSEMBLED (world-history, computer-science, economics, philosophy)
  - CS batch 1 needs regeneration via /generate-questions skill
- **Parent domain questions (wave 2)**: 0/4 not started (linguistics, sociology, psychology, archaeology)
- **"all" domain**: needs rebuild + unique questions after parent domains done
- **Total questions so far**: ~2,300 (42 sub-domains × 50 + 4 parent domains × 50)
