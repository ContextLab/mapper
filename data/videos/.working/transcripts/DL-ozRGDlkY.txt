So now that we've spent some time thinking about what a differential equation is and even visualizing solutions to a differential equation using things like Slope Field, let's start seeing if we can actually solve differential equations. And as we'll see, different types of differential equations might require different techniques. And some of them we might not be able to solve at all using analytic techniques. We'd have to resort to numeric techniques to estimate the solutions. But let's go to what I would argue is the simplest form of differential equation to solve. And that's what's called a separable, separable differential equation. And we will see in a second why it is called a separable differential equation. So let's say that we have the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to negative x over ye to the x squared. So we have this differential equation. And we want to find the particular solution that goes through the point, that goes through the point zero comma one. And I encourage you to pause this video and I'll give you a hint. If you can, on one side of this equation, through algebra, separate out the y's and the dy's. And on the other side, have all the x's and dx's and then integrate, perhaps you can find the particular solution to this differential equation that contains this point. Now if you can't do it, don't worry, because we're about to work through it. So as I said, let's use a little bit of algebra to get all the y's and dy's on one side and all the x's and dx's on the other side. So one way, let's say I want to get all the y's and dy's on the left-hand side and all the x's and dx's on the right-hand side. Well I can multiply both sides times y. So I can multiply both sides times y. That has the effect of putting the y's on the left-hand side. And I can multiply both sides times dx. I can multiply both sides times dx. And we kind of treat, you can treat these differentials as you would treat a variable when you're manipulating it to essentially separate out the variables. And so this will cancel with that. And so we are left with, we are left with y, dy, y, dy is equal to negative x and actually let me write it this way. Let me write it as negative xe, actually I might, a little more space. So negative xe to the negative x squared dx. Dx. Now why is this interesting? Because we can integrate both sides. And now this also highlights why we call this separable. You won't be able to do this with every differential equation. You won't be able to algebraically separate the y's and dy's on one side and the x's and dx's on the other side. But this one we were able to. And so that's why this is called a separable differential equation. And it's usually the first technique that you should try. Hey, can I separate the y's and the x's? And as I said, this is not going to be true of many if not most differential equations. But now that we did this, we can integrate both sides. So let's do that. So I'll find a nice color to integrate with. So I'm going to integrate both sides. Now if you integrate the left hand side, what do you get? You get, and remember we're integrating with respect to y here. So this is going to be y squared over two. And we could put some constant there. I could call that plus c one. And if you're integrating now, that's going to be equal to, now the right hand side we're integrating with respect to x. And let's see, you could do u substitution or you could recognize that look, the derivative of negative x squared is going to be negative two x. So if that was a two there, and if you don't want to change the value of the integral, you put the one half right over there. And so now you could either do u substitution explicitly or you could do it in your head. Or you said u is equal to negative x squared. And then du will be negative two x dx. Or you can kind of do this in your head at this point. So I have something and it's derivative. So I really could just integrate with respect to that something, with respect to that u. So this is going to be one half, this one half right over here. The antiderivative of this is e to the negative x squared. And then of course I might have some other constant. I'll just call that c two. And once again, if this part over here, what I just did seems strange, the u substitution, you might want to review that piece. Now, what can I do here? Well I have a constant on the left hand side. It's an arbitrary constant. We don't know what it is. I haven't used this initial condition yet. We could call it. So let me just subtract c one from both sides. So if I just subtract c one from both sides, I have an arbitrary, so this is going to cancel. I'm going to have c two, sorry, let me, so this is c one. So these are going to cancel. And c two minus c one, these are both constants, arbitrary constants. We don't know what they are yet. And so we could just rewrite this as, on the left hand side we have y squared over two is equal to on the right hand side, I'll write one half e, let me write that in blue just because I've written it in blue before. One half, one half e to the negative x squared. And I'll just say c two minus c one, let's just call that c. So if you take the sum of those two things, let's just call that c. And so now, this is kind of a general solution. We don't know what this constant is. And we haven't explicitly solved for y yet, but even in this form, we can now find a particular solution using this initial condition. Let me separate it out. This wasn't part of this original expression right over here. But using this initial condition. So it tells us when x is zero, y needs to be equal to one. So we would have one squared, which is just one, over two is equal to one half e to the negative zero squared. Well that's just going to be, e to the zero is just one. So it's gonna be one half plus c. And just like that, we're able to figure out if you subtract one half from both sides, c is equal to zero. So the relationship between y and x that goes through this point, we could just set c is equal to zero. So that's equal to zero. That's zero right over there. And so we are left with y squared over two is equal to e to the negative x squared over two. Now we can multiply both sides by two and we're going to get y squared. So we're gonna get y squared is equal to e to the negative x squared. Now we can take the square root of both sides and you can say, well look, y squared is equal to this. So y could be equal to the plus or minus square root of e to the negative x squared. But they gave us an initial condition where y is actually positive. So we're finding the particular solution that goes through this point. That means y is gonna be the positive square root. If this was the point zero negative one, then we would say y is the negative square root. But we know that y is the positive square root. It's the principal root right over there. So let me do that a little bit neater. So we can get rid of, whoops, I thought I was writing in black. So we can get rid of this right over here. We're only going to be dealing with the positive square root, or we could, so we could write y is equal to e to the negative x squared to the one half power. And that of course is equal to e to the negative x squared over two. So this right over here is, or y equals, y equals e to the negative x squared over two is a particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions to this original differential equation. So just like that, because we were able to, just as a review, because this differential equation was set up in a way, or because we could algebraically separate the y's, d y's from the x's, d x's, we were able to just separate them out, algebraically, integrate both sides, and use the information given in the initial condition to find the particular solution.
