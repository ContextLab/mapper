The bacteria in a Petri dish culture are self-duplicating at a rapid pace. The relationship between the elapsed time T in minutes and the number of bacteria B of T in the Petri dish is modeled by the following function. We see it's an exponential model here. How many bacteria will make up the culture after 120 minutes? So really they just wanna say, well what is B of 120 going to be? And so it's going to be 10 times two to the 120 divided by 12th power. So this is going to be equal to 10 times two to the, 120 divided by 12 is 10th power. So this is going to be equal to 10 times, two to the 10th power is 1,024. If you wanna verify that, you could say, well two to the fifth is equal to 32. And so two to the 10th is going to be two to the fifth times two to the fifth. And 32 times 32 is, let's see, 64, zero, six. So let's see, we're gonna have six, sorry. Three times 32 is 96. So you have a four, 12, 1024. So this is gonna be 1024. 10 times that is going to be equal to 10,240. So 10,200, 10,240 bacteria. And we're done.
