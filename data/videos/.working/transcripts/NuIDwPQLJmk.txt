What we're going to do in this video, think about how we might multiply 592 times seven. And in general, we're gonna think about how we would approach multiplying something that has multiple digits times something that has one digit. And the way we're gonna do it is the way that if you were to ask your parents, it's probably the way that they do it. And so the typical approach is you would write the larger multi-digit number on top, and then you would write the smaller single digit number below that, and since it's in the ones place of seven, you would put it in the ones place column. So you'd put it right below the ones place in the larger number, so right below that two, and then you write the multiplication symbol. And the way you think about it is, all right, I'm just gonna take each of these places and multiply it by the seven. So for example, if I'm taking those two ones and I'm multiplying it times seven, well, that's gonna be 14 ones. Well, there's no digit for 14. I can only put four of those ones over here. And then the other 10 ones, I can express as one 10, and so I'd put it up there. Sometimes when people learn it, they say, hey, two times seven is 14, I write the four and I carry the one, but all you're doing is you're saying, hey, 14 is one 10 plus four ones. But then you move over to the tens place. You say, hey, what's nine tens times seven? Well, nine times seven is 63, so nine tens times seven is 63 tens, plus another 10 is 64 tens. You can only put four of those tens over here. So the other 60 tens, you can express as 600s. So you can stick that right over there. Now, a lot of people would explain that as saying, hey, nine times seven is 63, plus one is 64, write the four and carry the six. But hopefully you understand what we mean by carrying. You're really trying to write 64 tens. Only four of those tens can be expressed over here, or that's maybe the cleanest way to do it. And then the other 60 tens you can express as 600s. And then last but not least, 500s times seven is going to be 3500s. And then you add 600s, you get 4100s. So 4100s, so it's 4144. Now, I wanna reconcile this or connect it to with other ways that you might have seen this. So let's say that, let's do this again. So if we were to write 592 times seven. So one way that we've approached in the past is we say, all right, what's two times seven? Well, that's going to be 14. Notice, that's the same 14. We're just representing it a little bit differently. Then we might say, well, what is nine times seven? It's the same color. And it's really nine tens times seven. That's 63 tens. So you might write it right over there, which is the same thing as 630. And then you could think about what is 500s times seven? Well, that's 3500s. So you could write it like that. Same thing as 3500. And then you would add everything up. So you have a total of four ones. You have a total of four tens. You have a total of 1100s. So you could write 100 there. And then regroup the other 10 hundreds into the thousands place as 1000. 1000 plus 3000 is 4000. So we got the exact same answer because we essentially did the same thing. Over here, when we were carrying it, we were essentially regrouping things from here. And you could think about it where we're condensing our writing versus what we did here. Here, we just very systematically said two times seven, nine times seven, five times seven. But we made sure to keep track of the places to figure out what each of those, you could think of it as partial products would be. And then we added. Well, here we carried along the way, essentially regrouping the values. When we said, hey, two ones times seven ones, that's 14 ones, which is the same thing as four ones plus one 10. And so on and so forth. So I encourage you, one, it's good to learn this method. It's the most common way that folks multiply. Once again, your parents probably learned it this way. But it's really valuable to understand why these two things are the same thing. So really ponder that, think about that, and see if it all makes sense what's going on. That you're not just blindly memorizing the steps.
