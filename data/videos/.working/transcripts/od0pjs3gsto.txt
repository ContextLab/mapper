One day each week, Jamie and Brennan have a chore to cook dinner for their whole family. But they do get to choose which day they cook. On Sunday night, Jamie makes the following proposal. Let's roll the six-sided die. If it's a one, we can cook on Monday. If it's a two, we cook on Tuesday, three Wednesday, four Thursday, five Friday. If it's a six, then we roll again until we get a one through a five. But who will cook? Dad always gets home around five o'clock. If he gets home before five o'clock on the day we choose, you cook dinner. This is Jamie talking. Before five, let me write this. Before, we're using a color that's easier to read. Before five, Jamie's proposal is before five o'clock, then Brennan will cook, then Brennan, and then if he gets home after five, I'll cook dinner. So I guess five or after. Five or after. Five or after. Jamie. Jamie will cook. Jamie will cook. Below is a frequency table that shows their dad's arrival times so far this year. Assume the table represents the true probabilities of their dad arriving before and after five on each day. Is Jamie's proposal a fair way of deciding who cooks dinner? So let's think about it. So first of all, do all of the days, his proposal right over here or her, I don't know if Jamie's a boy or a girl, if the proposal on the table says, essentially, that they're going to cook on Monday through Friday. So it's going to be a weekday because there's no way to get a Saturday or Sunday because if they roll a six, they just re-roll and then they get something between one and five. So when you think about it, it does look like every day has a one fifth chance or you could say a 20% chance of getting chosen. You might say, well, hey, isn't there just a one sixth probability that one of the days will get picked on the first roll? That's true. That's the first roll. But then if we get a six, then we keep rolling, we roll and roll and roll again until we eventually get, until we stop rolling sixes and we eventually roll something that's a non-six. And they all have an equally likely outcome. There's no favoritism towards Monday or towards Friday. So if you have five equally likely outcomes, so if you have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, you have five equally likely outcomes and those are all the possible outcomes, then they each have a 20%. They each have a 20% chance of happening. And we could draw a fancy kind of probability thing to show this that, okay, they each have a one sixth probability on the first roll but then there's a one sixth probability roll again and then they have a one sixth roll after that and you would have this, essentially this infinite sum that would come out to be 20% for each day. The easiest way to think about it is, one of these five outcomes is going to happen and they're all equally likely, so it's 20% chance of each. But that by itself does not answer the question of whether Jamie's proposal is fair. Because if we look over here, before five, when Brennan would have to cook, and let me make you, was it Brennan was the name? Yeah, Brennan. So before five, this is Brennan's situation. Brennan, when Brennan has to cook. And after five, this is when Jamie has to cook. And if you look across all of the weekdays, it looks like there's a 50-50 chance of being before five or after five, or I guess five or after, five o'clock is probably included in that. But let's just say it is. So it looks like 50-50 throughout the week. But on any given day, it looks like Monday, it's a little bit more likely, or a good bit more likely, that Jamie's going to have to cook. On Tuesday, it's more likely that Brennan's going to have to cook. On Wednesday, it's a little bit more likely that Jamie's going to cook, but it's not as big of a difference as it was on Monday. On Thursday, it's four times more likely that Brennan's going to cook than Jamie's going to cook. And on Friday, it's a good bit more likely that Jamie cooks more than Brennan. So one way to think about this is, well, let's just figure out the probability, the probability that, let's say, that Brennan has to cook on a given day. So what's that going to be? So let's see. There is a 20% chance, there's a 20% chance that our die roll gets us to Monday. And actually, let me just write that as a decimal. So it's 0.2. And if we are dealing with Monday, then Brennan has a 5-20th chance of having to cook. So 0.2 times 5 over 20, which is really the same thing as 1 fourth, 5 over 20. Then there's a 20% chance of it happening on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Brennan has a 15 over 20 chance of having to cook, or 3 fourths chance. On Wednesday, which is also a 20% chance that they're going to have to do the cooking on Wednesday, Brennan has an 8-20th chance of having to cook that day. So 8-20ths is the same thing as 2 fifths. And then on Thursday, once again, 20% chance they're going to have to cook on Thursday, so a 15-20th chance that Brennan is going to have to cook. That's the same thing as 4 fifths. And then finally on Friday, which once again, there's a 20% chance that eventually the die rolling system gets to Friday. And here Brennan has a 6-20th chance of having to cook, which is the same thing as 3 over 10. So we can factor out the 20% here, so 0.2, or the 0.2, and it's going to be 1 fourth plus 3 fourths plus 2 fifths plus 4 fifths plus 3 tenths, which is going to be equal to 1 fourth plus 3 fourths, that's equal to 1. 2 fourths, 2 fifths plus 4 fifths, this is equal to 6 fifths plus 3 tenths. So let's see, let me write it all in terms of tenths. So you have 10 tenths, that's 1, plus 12 tenths, that's 6 fifths, plus 3 tenths gets us to 25 tenths, which of course is the same thing as 5 halves. So all of this stuff right over here simplifies to 5 halves. And so we get the probability that Brennan has to cook. Brennan has to cook that week, Brennan has to cook is going to be equal to 0, let me do that purple color, 0.2 times 5 halves, times 5 over 2. Well, what's that going to be? Well, 0.2 is the same thing as 1 fifth times 5 halves, which is just the same thing as 1 half. So we've just established that Brennan has a 1 half chance of having to cook that week, which means that Jamie has a 1 half chance of having to cook that week. And this was a pretty good indicator that that was going to happen right over here, that there's a 50% chance that it's going to happen before 5 o'clock, and a 50% chance that it's going to be 5 or after. And on any given day, there's equal odds, 20 or equal probability, 20% chance, the cooking day. So I would say Jamie's proposal is fair. Yes, Jamie's proposal is a fair way of deciding who cooked dinner, and frankly, which day of the week it is. What is the probability that Wednesday is chosen and Brennan cooks dinner? So we've already thought about that. There's a 20% chance that Wednesday is chosen, and Brennan has an 8 20th probability of cooking that day. 8 20th is the same thing as 2 fifths. 8 divided by 4 is 2, 20 divided by 4 is 5. So 0.2 times 2 fifths, that's the same thing. 0.2 is 1 fifth times 2 fifths, which is the same thing. This is equal to 2 over 25. And if we wanted to write it in terms of a percentage, if we wanted it as a decimal, this of course would be the same thing as 0 point, we multiply the numerator and denominator by, well, if we wanted to, this is the same thing as 8 over 100, which is equal to an 8% chance. The probability that Wednesday is chosen and Brennan cooks dinner is 8%, or 0.08.
