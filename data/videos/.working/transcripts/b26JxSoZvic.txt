Let's think about what three divided by one fourth is equal to. Pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own, and I'll give you a hint. Take three holes and divide it into pieces or sections that are each one fourth of a hole, and then think about how many sections you have. All right, now let's work through this together. Now let me draw three holes, and so let's say this is, I'm gonna hand draw it so it's not gonna be perfect, but let's say that is one hole right over there. This is two holes right over there, and then I have my third hole just like that, and now I'm going to divide it into pieces or sections that are each one fourth of a hole. So this first hole is four pieces that are each one fourth each, or four fourths, and then I have another four fourths right over here, and then I have another four fourths right over here. Another way to think about it, I took the three holes and I divided it into fourths, so if you divide it into fourths, how many pieces am I going to have? Well, this is pretty straightforward. You have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 pieces, and I didn't even have to count that. Each hole is going to be four fourths, so three holes is going to be three times four fourths, or 12 pieces or 12 sections, so that is going to be equal to 12. Another way to think about it is, if you take three and you divide it into equal sections that are each a fourth, you're going to have 12 equal sections.
