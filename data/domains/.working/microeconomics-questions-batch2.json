    "correct_answer": "A direct tax is levied on a person's or organization's income or wealth and cannot be shifted to another party, while an indirect tax is levied on goods or services and can be passed on to consumers through higher prices.",
    "distractors": [
      "A direct tax is collected by the federal government and an indirect tax is collected by local municipalities, regardless of what is being taxed.",
      "A direct tax applies only to corporations and an indirect tax applies only to individual consumers based on their household size.",

    "distractors": [
      "Because government regulations require firms to report both categories separately on their annual financial statements and tax filings.",
      "Because explicit costs are borne by the producer and implicit costs are always borne by the consumer, so both must be summed for market analysis.",

      "Total revenue increases because the higher price per unit more than compensates for any reduction in the number of units sold to consumers.",

    "distractors": [
      "Because government regulations in competitive markets require every firm to set its price exactly equal to its average total cost at all output levels.",

      "Producer surplus increases because the tax allows producers to raise their prices by more than the amount of the tax on each unit sold.",
