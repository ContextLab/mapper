John is making pasta dough. To make the dough, he mixed 3 halves cups wheat flour with 3 fourths cups regular flour and some water. Write an inequality to express the relationship between the wheat flour and the regular flour. So he mixed 3 halves cups of wheat flour. 3 halves is the exact same thing as 1 and 1 half, if we were to write it as a mixed number. So it's more than 1 cup of wheat flour. And he mixes that with 3 fourths cups of regular flour. Well, 3 fourths is less than 1. So 3 halves is definitely greater than 3 fourths. And we can write that. We can just pick greater than right over there. 3 halves is greater than 3 fourths. Let's do a couple more of these. One of the deepest points in the Indian Ocean, the Diamantina Trench, is at negative 8 kilometers. We say it is negative 8 kilometers because it is 8 kilometers below sea level. The deepest part of the Bering Strait is at negative 5 and 4 ninths kilometers. Write an inequality to show the relationship between these two points and determine which point is deeper. So let's say we have a greater than sign here. So we want to write whichever quantity is greater on the left-hand side. So we look right over here. This number, negative 5 and 4 ninths, it is less negative. So it's actually going to be a greater value. It's not as deep. So we can write negative 5 and 4 ninths is greater than negative 8. Or negative 5 and 4 ninths kilometers is greater than negative 8 kilometers. And so if we're thinking about which point is deeper, it's going to be the one that's more negative because that tells us how far below sea level we are. So the negative 8 kilometer point is further below sea level. So let's see. Negative 8 kilometers. The Diamantina Trench. A negative 8 kilometers is the deeper point. And this is fun because in some of these questions, you actually learn things. I always thought that the deepest part of the Bering Sea. Well, anyway, we can talk about that another time. So negative 8 kilometers. So Diamantina Trench. Let's do one more. John is making noodles. To make the batter, he mixes 11 16th cups tapioca flour with 3 8ths cups rice flour and some water. Right in inequality to express the relationship between the tapioca flour and rice flour. So we're really comparing 11 16 cups of tapioca to 3 8ths cups rice flour. So we're really comparing these two fractions. And at first, it might seem hard to compare. You have different denominators. But 3 8ths could easily be converted to a fraction with 16 as a denominator. What would you do? Well, if you doubled both the 3 and the 8, you have to do the same thing to the numerator and the denominator. This fraction, 3 8ths, is equivalent to 6 16ths. And then you would have the same denominator. You could compare 11 16ths to 6 16ths. Well, if you have the same denominator and this numerator is greater, 11 is greater than 6, 11 16ths is going to be greater than 6 16ths, which is the same thing as 3 8ths. And we got it right.
