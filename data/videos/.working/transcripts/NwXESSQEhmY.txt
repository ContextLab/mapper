Hey there, if you've heard of Conmigo, Conacademy's AI-powered tutor and teaching assistant, you probably know about how it's been developed to help students solve math problems without giving away the answer, strengthen arguments through debate, or break down complex science concepts. Now, we're proud to present our latest Conmigo feature, Academic Essay Feedback. This new feature provides immediate, high-quality feedback on essays to help students become more skilled and confident writers. Let me show you how it works. To get started, all a student needs to do is submit their essay draft along with some details about the assignment, click Submit, and then Conmigo gets to work generating both positive and constructive feedback at the student's grade level. You can see that unlike other writing tools, Conmigo provides more than just spelling or mechanics feedback. It offers insights into everything from essay structure and organization, to how well arguments are supported, even down to style and tone. Students can view the feedback, ask for clarifications or examples, make revisions, and then request more reviews. It's like having a personal writing coach at their fingertips. Teachers who found themselves struggling to regularly provide timely, personalized feedback on hundreds of essays can now ensure that their students get immediate, quality feedback on their first drafts, without Conmigo ever doing the writing for them. And like all other Conmigo activities, the student experience is moderated for safety, and teachers can view a record of the student's interactions, including initial and revised drafts, in their chat history.
