We're told on the following number line, point A is at negative one, we can see that there, and point B is at three, all right? What is the location of point C, which is two-thirds of the distance from point B to point A? So pause this video and see if you can figure that out before we do this together. All right, now let's do this together. So if we're going two-thirds of the distance from point B to point A, so we're gonna start at point B, and if we went all the distance to point A, we would go all of that way. But we don't wanna go the whole distance, we wanna go two-thirds of this distance. But to figure out how far we should go, we first have to figure out what this distance is going to be. So we're going from positive three to negative one here. So one way to think about it, you could take your endpoint and subtract your starting point, and you get negative four, and you're like, how is that a distance? Well, you could view that as you're going four down. The distance here, if you just think of it in absolute terms, is a positive four. So the distance here is four. Another way to think about it is, you go three to get to zero, and then you go another one, so that is four to get to negative one. So we wanna go two-thirds of the way down this four. So what is two-thirds of four? So two-thirds times four, well, that is the same thing as two-thirds times four over one, which is the same thing as eight-thirds. And if we wanna write that as a mixed number, three goes into eight two times with a remainder two. So this is two and two-thirds. So we wanna go down two and two-thirds of a whole. So let's go down one, go down two, and now we're going to go down two-thirds, and luckily this is split into thirds. So we're gonna go down another third and then two-thirds. So point C is going to be right over there, and we are done.
