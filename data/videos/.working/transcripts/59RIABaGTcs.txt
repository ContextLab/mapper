Several videos ago, we introduced the idea of a Fourier series that I could take a periodic function, we started with the example of this square wave, and that I could represent it as the sum of weighted sines and cosines. And then we took a little bit of an interlude, building up some of our mathematical foundations, just establishing a bunch of properties of taking the definite integral over the period of that periodic function of sine and cosines, and we established all of these properties, and now we're going to get the benefit from establishing all of those, because we're going to start actually finding at least a formula for Fourier coefficients, and then we can apply it to our original square wave to see that, hey, this could actually be a pretty straightforward thing. So right over here, I have rewritten a Fourier series expression, or I've rewritten the Fourier series for a periodic function f of t, let's say its period is two pi, and I'm gonna use this in some of the properties that we have established to start solving for these actual coefficients. And what I'm gonna do in this video, I'm gonna first try to solve for a sub zero, and then in the next video, we're gonna solve for an arbitrary a sub n, and either in that one or the next one, we'll also solve for an arbitrary b sub n. So to solve for a sub zero, what we're going to do is take the definite integral of both sides from zero to two pi, so zero to two pi dt of f of t, well that's gonna be the same thing as going from zero to two pi of all of this stuff. And remember, this is an infinite series right over here, we have an infinite number of terms, and then we would have a dt out there. But we know from our integration properties, taking the definite integral of a sum, even an infinite sum, is the same thing as the sum of the definite integrals. So that's gonna be the same thing as taking this integral, dt, plus this integral, and I could take the scalar out, actually let me not just do that, let me just write it like this, zero to two pi dt, zero to two pi dt, zero to two pi dt, this is getting a little monotonous, but it'll be worth it, zero to two pi dt, zero to two pi dt, zero to two pi dt, and we'll do it for every single one of the terms. And now what's nice is we can look at our integration properties, this right over here, we could take these coefficients out, we could take this a sub one, put it in front of the integral sign, the a sub two, put it in front of the integral sign, the b sub one, put it in front of the integral sign, and then all you're left with is an integral from zero to two pi of cosine of some integer multiple of t dt. Well we established, a couple of videos ago, that's always going to be equal to zero, the integral from zero to two pi of cosine of some non zero integer multiple of t dt, that is equal to zero. And then the same thing is true for sine of mt. So this is gonna be fun. This is gonna be zero based on what we just saw. If you just take that factor out of that integral, take that a sub one out of the integral, it's gonna be a sub one times zero. It's gonna be a sub two times zero, that's gonna be zero, that's gonna be zero, that's gonna be zero, that's gonna be zero. Every term's gonna be zero except for this one involving a sub zero. And so what is this going to be equal to? Well let me write it this way. Let's take the integral of the definite integral. Let me see where I have some space. So we're gonna take the definite integral from zero to two pi of a sub zero dt. Well that's the same thing. Once again we can take the coefficient out of a sub zero and I can just put the dt like, I can just put the dt like this. And so that's going to be equal to a sub zero times t, let me do that in magenta, times t evaluated at two pi and zero which is going to be equal to a sub zero times two pi minus zero times two pi minus zero. Well that's just two pi a sub zero. So I can just write this a sub zero times two pi. So this expression right here is a sub zero times two pi. So let me scroll down a little bit. So I can rewrite this thing up here. The integral from zero to two pi of f of t dt, f of t dt, which is equal to this integral. Well we've just figured out that the integral from zero to two pi of a sub zero dt is the same thing as a sub zero times two pi is equal to a sub zero times two pi, times two pi. And so now it's actually pretty straightforward to solve for a sub zero. A sub zero is going to be equal to, a sub zero is going to be equal to one over two pi, one over two pi times the definite integral from zero to two pi, I'll just write the dt of, let me write it a little bit, dt of f of t, I'll just write it like this, f of t dt. And this is pretty cool, because think about what this is. This over here, this is the average value of our function, this is the average value of f over the interval zero to two pi. Average value of f over the interval over, we could say the interval from zero, the interval from zero to two pi. And hopefully that actually makes intuitive sense, because if you just think of it from an engineering point of view, if we were just trying to engineer this, trying to just play around with these numbers, you know all of these cosines and sines, they oscillate between positive one and negative one. So in order to actually represent this function, you're going to have to shift that oscillation, and a sum of a bunch of oscillations is still going to be an oscillation that's going to vary between positive one and our negative one. And in order to shift it, well that's what our a sub zero is going to do. And so it makes sense that you would want to shift the oscillation so it oscillates around the average value of the function, or you could say the average value of the function over an interval that's representative of a period of that function. And so that is what a sub zero is doing. A sub zero is just going to be that average value of the function.
