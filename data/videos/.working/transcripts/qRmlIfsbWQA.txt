We're asked to find 10 to the 1.5th power using a calculator. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth. So let's get our calculator out. And it'll be a little bit different depending on the type of calculator you're using, but I'm just gonna use the TI-85 right over here. And there's actually a couple of ways to do it. You could literally just type in 10 to the, that little caret sign right there means to the 1.5th power. And so we could get 31.62. They said what, to the hundredths place? So 31.62. The other way you could do it is you could use the, essentially what's the inverse of the log button right over here. So if you do second log, because log is base 10, it immediately goes 10 to the, and we do 1.5 again. That seems a little bit more cumbersome though because you have to press that orange button and all that. And you get the same answer. So it's 31, if we round to the nearest hundredths, 31.62 because the thousandths place is less than five. So we round down, 31.62. So we get 10 to the 1.5th power is approximately equal to 31.62 when we round to the nearest hundredths.
