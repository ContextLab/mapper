What I want to do in this video is to give you an intuitive sense of how a market for currencies would actually work. It's very non-intuitive for a lot of people because we're going to be talking about currencies becoming more expensive or cheaper or the price of a currency in terms of another one. I want to just give you a very intuitive feel for that. Let's say, because it's a hot topic right now, let's just make the two currencies, the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar. The unit of exchange, and China is a little confusing because sometimes they use the word renminbi, sometimes the word wan. The wan is the unit of the renminbi. Let's say right now, if I were to just go on some website, and this is not the actual exchange rate right now, but let's say right now the quoted exchange rate is 10 wan per US dollar. 10 wan is equal to 1 US dollar. Every time I say dollar in this video, I'm referring to the US dollar is equal to 1 US dollar. I think this makes sense to a lot of people. If I have 1 dollar, I want to convert it to 1, I get 10 of them. If I have 10 wan, I want to convert it to dollars. Someone's going to give me a dollar for it. Let's imagine a situation, and in the next few videos I'll construct actual trade imbalances where this would actually happen. Let's say we live in a reality where there are 1,000, so let's say someone has 1,000 wan. Let's say that this person right here has 1,000 wan and wants to convert to dollars. Let's say on this side, and if we just superficially looked at this 1,000 wan and looked at the quoted rate, we'd say, hey, that 1,000 wan you divide, you get 10 wan per dollar, so that should be 100 dollars at the quoted rate. Let's say you have two other actors over here, and obviously these markets involve many, many more than just three people, but this will help us simplify or at least understand how these exchange rates would work. Let's say that this person right here with the mustache, let's say that this person right over there and maybe a hat as well, let's say that he has $50, let me put it, let's say he has 100 dollars, that he needs to convert to wan. Maybe he wants to buy some Chinese goods. Maybe he's a Chinese factory owner who sold his goods in the US, $400, and now he needs to convert it back to wan to pay his employees or pay his own mortgage or who knows what. Let's say that there's another person. Let's say that there's another character over here, and let's say that she also has 100 dollars that need to be converted into wan. Net-net, what's happening here? What's the total demand to convert wan into dollars and dollars into wan? Well, if you look at the whole market, you have 200 dollars that need to be converted into wan. Let me write this down. We have a situation where 200 dollars need to be converted into wan, and then on the other side of that transaction, we have 1001 need to be converted into dollars. They are representing the entire market, although as we know, in currency markets, especially there's thousands or even millions of actors actively participating in them. What's going to happen? All of these people might just go on the internet and look up the current exchange rate, or the last exchange that occurred, and say, hey, you know what? Me over here, this 100 dollars, I should be able to convert it into 1000 wan, but she also says I should be able to convert this 100 dollars into 1000 wan. They collectively think that that 200 dollars can be converted into 2000 wan. I'll put this in question marks. Will they be able to convert this into 2001? On this person over here, he's saying, well, just at the current exchange rate, maybe I'll be able to get 100 dollars, but everyone wants to maximize the amount of the other currency they get for obvious reasons. They want to maximize the amount of money they get. Now, will these two people be able to convert their money into 2001? Remember, what I said is this is the entire market, and it's a huge simplification, but there is this imbalance here, more dollars into one than one into dollars. Now, they won't be able to convert into 2001 because there's only 1000 wan that wants to be traded. There is only 1000 wan that wants to be traded. So you can imagine this guy over here, maybe he wants to do it slowly just to kind of see what the market is like. So let's say at first he puts 10 wan up, essentially for bid. You could view it either way. You could say that maybe one of these people put a dollar up for bid, and this guy is bidding on that dollar in terms of wan, or this guy is putting wan up for bid, and these guys are going to bid on it in terms of dollars, either one. And that's why it's sometimes confusing with currencies because you're buying another currency. But since this guy is more in demand, to simplify things, it's him, the person, that's kind of able to create an auction type situation, which really is what the markets are trying to do so that you can equalize supply and demand. So he might initially say, hey, you know what, I want to convert... He has 100 wan and he wants to convert it. So he says, you know what, I'm willing to sell 100 wan for $10. So let's say he sells 100 wan for $10. So he sells 100, or offers I should say, offers to sell 100, 100 wan for $10. He just thinks that that's a fair offer price right over there. And that's this guy over here, this guy actually converting wan into dollars. Well, what's going to happen? Well, one of these people is just going to jump at that. They say, oh, you know what, I think that's a fair price. And so let's say this woman right over here takes it. Then actually both of them maybe have saw that offer to sell 100 wan for $10. And they both try to click their mouse or however they're trying to make the transaction happening. But let's say she clicks her mouse a little faster and she gets the transaction. So let's say that person, let's call this person B, and this is person A, and this is person C. So person B accepts. So two things happened just then. One is person C says, wow, that was pretty fast. Someone was very willing to take it for 10 wan per US dollar. And then this guy goes, my god, I need to convert my money into wan, but I wasn't able to. Someone else beat me to the punch. So this guy over here is not an idiot. He's like, hey, maybe people are willing to give me more dollars per wan. So let's say that this guy right over here, this guy in orange, he then offers to sell, let's say he wants to sell 91 for $10. Notice the price of the wan has now gone up or the price of the dollar has now gone down. Either one, those are the symmetric statements. They mean the exact same thing. So all of a sudden, this person has a lot of dollars he needs to convert into wan. So he accepts really fast. So person A accepts. And I'm doing a huge oversimplification, but it gives you the general idea to show you that this really is a market. So person A accepts. All of a sudden, we have a new quoted exchange rate. All of a sudden, we have an exchange rate of what is this? Nine wans. So we have new quoted rate, or the transaction happens, at nine wans per dollar. Now what's happening? And I think you see the dynamic that's going to happen. There's more dollars that need to be converted into wan than wan that needs to be converted into dollars. So this guy, as he sees that there's a lot of demand to get his 1,000 wan, he's going to keep offering fewer and fewer wans per dollar. Or these guys are going to start accepting fewer and fewer wans for each of their dollars. So as this happens, the price of the wan will go up. Notice the price of the wan went up here. It was 10 wans per dollar, now it's nine wans per dollar. Or you could say the price of the dollar has gone down. And this will just keep happening until all of them are able to get rid of their currency. There's no mathematical formula to say what the clearing price is. It's actually dependent on how badly each of these people are willing to transact and really how good they are at gaming each other. But the general result here, and this is kind of what I really want you to get from this video, is that because there's no law in a market exchange rate mechanism that says this has to be the exchange rate. We'll explore how you can peg it in the future. But there's nothing that says that this has to always be the case. If there's more demand for wan than dollars, as we see in this example, the price of the dollar will go down. The price of dollar will go down. And then, which is the exact same thing, which means the exact same thing as the price of wan will go up. I really want you to internalize this. The price of dollars will go up in terms of dollars. The price of dollars in terms of wan will go down. And this is the crux of foreign exchange. If you can at least internalize these ideas and to understand that there really is this market out here based on the supply and demand of wan, over here the demand for wan is exceeding its supply. So price will go up. Or you can view it the other way. The demand for dollars is below its supply. So the price will go down. Anyway, I'll let you think about that for a little bit. In the next video, we're going to apply this concept to see how this freely floating exchange rate can help equalize or should help equalize trade imbalances in an ideal world.
