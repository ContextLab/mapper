Let's learn about matrices. So what is a, and what do I mean when I say matrices? Well, matrices is just the plural for matrix, which is probably a word you're familiar with more because of Hollywood than because of mathematics. So what is a matrix? Well, it's actually a pretty simple idea. It's just a table of numbers. That's all a matrix is. So let me draw a matrix for you. I don't like that toothpaste colored blue, so let me use another color. So this is an example of a matrix. If I said, I don't know, I'm going to pick some random numbers out. 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, minus 5. That is a matrix. And all it is is a table of numbers. And oftentimes, if you wanted to have a variable for a matrix, you use a capital letter. So you could use a capital A. And sometimes in some books they make it extra bold, so it's like a bold A would be a matrix. And just a little bit of notation. So they would call this matrix, or we would call this matrix, just by convention. You would call this a 2 by 3 matrix. And sometimes they actually write it 2 by 3 below the bold letter they use to represent the matrix. And what is 2 and what is 3? Well, 2 is the number of rows. We have 1 row, 2 row. This is a row. And we have three columns. 1, 2, 3. So that's why it's called a 2 by 3 matrix. So when you say, if I said that B, I'll do it extra bold. If B is a 5 by 2 matrix, that means that B would have, I'll just type in number 0, minus 5, 10. And it has two, so it has five rows, it has two columns. So it'll have another column here. So let's see, minus 10, 3. I'm just putting in random numbers here. 7, 2, pi. That is a 5 by 2 matrix. So I think you'd have kind of a convention that all a matrix is is a table of numbers. You can represent it when you're doing it in variable form. You represent it as a bold face capital letter. Sometimes you'd write a 2 by 3 there. And you can actually reference the terms of the matrix. So in this example, in the top example, where we have matrix A, if someone wanted to reference, let's say, this element of the matrix. So what is that? That is in the second row. It's in row 2. And it's in column 2, right? This is column 1, this is column 2. This is row 1, row 2. So it's in the second row, second column. So sometimes people will write that A, and they'll write 2, comma, 2 is equal to 0. Or they might write, sometimes they'll write in the lower case, A, 2, comma, 2 is equal to 0. And you know, just as a, what is A? These are just the same thing. I'm just doing this to expose you to the notation. Because a lot of this really is just notation. So what is A, 1, comma, 3? Well, that means we're in the first row, in the third column. First row, 1, 2, 3, it's this value right here. So that equals 2. So this is just all the notation of, well, what a matrix is. It's a table of numbers. It can be represented this way. We can represent its different elements that way. So you might be asking, Sal, well, that's nice, a table of numbers with fancy words and fancy notations. But what is it good for? And that's the interesting point. A matrix is just a data representation. It's just a way of writing down data. That's all it is. It's a table of numbers. But it can be used to represent a whole set of phenomenon. And if you're doing this in your Algebra 1 or your Algebra 2 class, you're probably using it to represent linear equations. But we'll learn later that it, and I'll do a whole set of videos on applying matrices to a whole bunch of different things. But it can represent, it's very powerful if you're doing computer graphics, the matrix, the elements can represent pixels on your screen. They can represent points in coordinate space. They can represent, who knows? There's tons of things that they can represent. But the important thing to realize is the matrix isn't, it's not a natural phenomenon. It's not like a lot of the mathematical concepts we've been looking at. It's a way to represent a mathematical concept or way of representing values. But you kind of have to define what it's representing. But let's put that on the backburn a little bit in terms of what it actually represents. And then, oh, my wife is here. She's looking for our filing cabinet. Wait, what's? Back to what I was doing. So let's put on the backburner what a matrix is actually representing. And let's learn the convention. Because I think, at least initially, that tends to be the hardest part. How do you add matrices? How do you multiply matrices? How do you invert a matrices? How do you find the determinant of a matrix? I know all of those words might sound unfamiliar, unless you've already been confused by them in your Algebra class. So I'm going to teach you all of those things first, which are all just really human-defined conventions. And then later on, I'll make a whole bunch of videos on the intuition behind them and what they actually represent. So let's get started. So let's say I wanted to add these two matrices. Let's say the first one, and let me switch colors. So let's say, I'll do relatively small ones, just not Dway space. Say I have the matrix 3, negative 1, I don't know, 2, 0. I don't know, let's call that A, capital A. And let's say matrix B, and I'm just making up numbers. Matrix B is equal to minus 7, 2, 3, 5. So my question to you is, what is A, so I'm doing it bold, like they do in the textbooks, plus matrix B. So I'm adding two matrices. And once again, this is just human convention. Someone defined how matrices add. They could have defined it some other way, but they said, we're going to make matrices add the way I'm about to show you, because it's useful for a whole set of phenomena. So when you add two matrices, you essentially just add the corresponding elements. So how does that work? Well, you add the element that's in row 1, column 1, to the element row 1, column 1. So it's 3 plus minus 7. So 3 plus minus 7. That'll be the 1, 1 element. Then the row 1, column 2 element will be minus 1 plus 2. Minus 1 plus 2. I'm going to put parentheses around them so you know these are separate elements. And you could guess how this keeps going. This element will be 2 plus 3. And this last element will be 0 plus 5. So that equals 3 plus minus 7. That is minus 4. Minus 1 plus 2. That's 1. 2 plus 3 is 5. And 0 plus 5 is 5. So there we have it. That is how we humans have defined the addition of two matrices. And by this definition, you can imagine that this is going to be the same thing as b plus a. Remember, this is something we have to think about, because we're not adding numbers anymore. You know that 1 plus 2 is the same thing as 2 plus 1. Any two normal numbers, it doesn't matter what order you add them in. But matrices, it's not completely obvious. But when you define it in this way, it doesn't matter if we do a plus b or b plus a. If we did b plus a, this would just say negative 7 plus 3. This would say 2 plus negative 1. But it would come out to the same values. That is matrix addition. And you can imagine, matrix subtraction, it's essentially the same thing. Well, actually, let me show you. What would be a minus b? Well, you could also view it as capital B. It's a matrix. That's why I'm making an extra bold. Well, that's the same thing as a plus minus 1 times b. And what's b? Well, b is minus 7, 2, 3, 5. And when you multiply a scalar, when you just multiply a number times a matrix, you just multiply that number times every one of its elements. So that equals a matrix a plus the matrix. We just multiply this negative 1 times every element in here. So 7 minus 2 minus 3 and 5. And then we could do what we did up there. And we know what a is. So this would equal, let's see, a is up here. So 3 plus 7 is 10. Negative 1 plus negative 2 is minus 3. 2 plus minus 3 is minus 1. And 0 plus 5 is 5. And you didn't have to go through this exercise right here. You could have literally just subtracted these elements from these elements and you would have gotten the same value. I did this because I wanted to show you also that multiplying a scalar times, or just a value or a number times a matrix, is just multiplying that number times all of the elements of the matrix. And so by this definition of matrix addition, what do we know? Well, we know that both matrices have to be the same size by this definition, the way we're adding. So for example, you could add these two matrices. You could add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to this matrix. I don't know, minus 10, minus 100, minus 1,000. I'm making up numbers. 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1. You can add these two matrices, right? Because they have the same number of rows and the same number of columns. So for example, if you were to add them, the first term up here would be 1 plus minus 10, so it would be minus 9, 2 plus minus 100, minus 98. I think you get the point. You'd have exactly nine elements, and you'd have three rows and three columns. But you could not add these two matrices. You could not add, let me do it in a different color, just to show you it's different. You could not add this blue. You could not add this matrix. Minus 3, 2 to the matrix, I don't know, 9, 7. And why can you not add them? Well, they don't have corresponding elements to add up. This is a one row by two column. This is one by two. And this is two by one. So they don't have the same dimension, so we can't add or subtract these matrices. And this is a side note. When a matrix has, when one of its dimensions is one, so for example, here you have one row and multiple columns. This is actually called a row vector. A vector is essentially a one dimensional matrix, where one of the dimensions is one. So this is a row vector, and similarly, this is a column vector. And that's just a little extra terminology that you should know. If you take linear algebra and calculus, your professor might use those terms, and it's good to be familiar with it. But anyway, I'm pushing 11 minutes, so I will continue this in the next video. See you soon.
