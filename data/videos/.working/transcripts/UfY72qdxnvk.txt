What we're gonna do in this video is talk a little bit about horizontal asymptotes. So what are we even talking about? Well, you could imagine some type of a function and I'm gonna draw the axis here. So that's our y-axis, this is our x-axis. And when we think about horizontal asymptotes, we're thinking about what happens if the function gets very, very positive or very, very negative. So another way to think about it, it might do all sorts of things when the x-values are small, but as they get large, it might approach some value. And similarly, as they get very negative, it might approach a value here. The way I've drawn it here, our horizontal asymptote, at least the way I drew it, looks like it is the x-axis, but it isn't always the x-axis. You might have a function with a horizontal asymptote at some other value. That function might look something like this. It might do all sorts of things down here, then as you get to very large x's, very positive or very negative x's, you approach that horizontal line, not quite ever get there, and that's why we call it an asymptote. So let's look at some examples where we're not looking at the graph and we're just looking at the definition of the function and see if we can figure out the horizontal asymptotes. So I will do this one in pink. So let's say we have f of x is equal to negative five x squared minus six x plus four over two x squared plus eight. And you might be saying, how do I figure out the horizontal asymptotes if I'm not graphing it? Well, the key thing to realize is what happens when x gets very positive or very negative? Well, when it gets very positive or very negative, the terms that dominate are the highest degree terms. So for example, we have, this is a rational function. It's expressed as a ratio, or you could say as a fraction in some ways, and you have a polynomial on top, a polynomial on the bottom. But if you look at the highest degree terms, if x becomes very, very, very large, this x squared becomes so much larger than this, or this negative five x squared in magnitude becomes so much larger than this negative six x or even this four. And somewhere in the denominator is x gets larger either in the positive or the negative direction, that x squared or the two x squared is going to matter a lot more than that eight. So one way to think about horizontal asymptotes is look at the highest degree term in the numerator and the denominator, and then think about, well, what happens if as they get big, you're roughly looking at something like this, negative five x squared over two x squared, four very positive x's or very negative x's. And in that world, well, the x squareds would cancel out and you would approach F of x is equal to negative five halves or another way, the line y is equal to negative five halves. And that's true if you put in very negative x's as well, or very positive, the x squared part would cancel out and you would get to negative five halves. So I'm not saying that this is what this graph looks like, but you could imagine a horizontal line like that at negative five halves. Let me give you another example. And here I'm gonna have the numerator and the denominator in factored form. So let's say I have G of x is equal to x minus four squared over x squared plus five times three x minus two. So pause this video, have a go at it before we do this together. So the key is once again, is to think about the highest degree terms in the numerator and the denominator. And to really help us there, we can just expand out we can multiply these things out. So in the numerator here, x minus four squared is x squared minus eight x plus 16. And then that's going to be over, let's see, x squared times three x is three x to the third. And then I can have x squared times negative two, so minus two x squared. Then I could have five times three x, which is 15x. And then I can have five times negative two, which is negative 10. So what happens when x gets very positive or very negative? Well, the highest degree terms here are the x squared in the numerator and the three x to the third in the denominator. So this three x to the third, this is going to grow much faster even than that x squared. So one way to think about it is as x's get very, very, very large, this is going to be approximately x squared over three x to the third. But then if you think about it that way, well, even if you were, since we're approximating for very large x's, for very positive x's, this would be approximately one over three x. And we know what happens here if x gets very large, that's going to approach y equals zero. Y equals zero. And you could also think about the same thing if you go to very negative values. You are once again going to, because you have a higher degree in the denominator, approach y equals zero. And you might be realizing to do this type of, just figuring out the asymptote without even trying to graph the actual function, you just have to look at the highest degree terms. So we didn't even have to expand everything out. We could said, oh, the highest degree term in the numerator is going to be x squared, highest degree term in the denominator is going to be three x to the third, the denominator is going to grow faster than the numerator, we're going to approach zero as we go to very positive or very negative x's.
