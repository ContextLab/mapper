which expressions are equivalent to x plus two y plus x plus two? Select all that apply. All right, let's see if I can manipulate this thing a little bit. Let me just rewrite it. So I have x plus two y plus x plus two. So the first thing that jumps out at me, before I even look at these choices, you have an x over here, I have an x over there. Well, if I have one x and then I can add it to another x, that would be two x. So I could rewrite this, let me do this in a different color. I could rewrite this x and this x. If I add them together, that's going to be two x. So this is, actually, I don't want to skip any steps. So that's x plus x plus two y. Now I'm just switching the order, plus two. And then these two x's right over here, I can just rewrite that as two x. So if two x plus two y plus two y plus two, now let's see, out of all of my choices, so this one, this is two x plus four y plus four. So that's not right. I have two x plus two y plus two. So I can rule this one out. Now this one's interesting. It looks like they have factored out a two. Let's see, if we factor out a two here, what happens? So we do see that two is a factor of that term, it's a factor of that term, and it's a factor of that term. So let's see if we can factor it out. So this is going to be two times x. I'll do the x in that same magenta color. Two times x plus, you have just a y left when you factor out the two. And then if you factor out a two here, you're just going to have a one left. So two times x plus y plus one, which is exactly what they have over here. And since I was able to find a choice, I will not pick none of the above.
