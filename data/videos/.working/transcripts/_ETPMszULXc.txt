The two-way frequency table below shows data on type of vehicle driven, so this is type of vehicle driven, and whether there was an accident in the last year, so whether there was an accident in the last year, for customers of all American auto insurance. Complete the following two-way table of column relative frequencies, so that's what they're talking here. This is a two-way table of column relative frequencies, if necessary, round your answers to the nearest 100. So let's see what they're saying. They're saying, let's see, of the accidents within the last year, 28 were the people were driving an SUV, a sport utility vehicle, and 35 were in a sports car. Of the no accidents in the last year, 97 were an SUV, and 104 were a sports car. Or another way you could think of it, of the sport utility vehicles that were driven, and the total, let's see, it's 28 plus 97, which is going to be 125. Of that 125, 28 had an accident within the last year, and 97 did not have an accident last year. Similarly, you could say, of the 139 sports cars, 35 had an accident last year, 104 did not have an accident last year. And so what they want us to do is put those relative frequencies in here. So the way we could think about it, one right over here, this represents all of the sport utility vehicles, one way you could think about it, that represents the whole universe of the sport utility vehicles, or at least the universe that this table shows. So that's really representative of the 28 plus 97. And so in each of these, we want to put the relative frequency. So this right over here is going to be 28 divided by the total. Notice over here it was 28, but we want this number to be the fraction of the total. Well, the fraction of the total is going to be 28 over 97 plus 28, which of course is going to be 125. Actually, let me just write them all like that first. This one right over here is going to be 97 over 125. And of course, when you add this one and this one, it should add up to one. Likewise, this one's going to be 35 over 139, 35 plus 104, so 139. And this is going to be 104 over 104 plus 35, which is 139. And so let me just calculate each of them using this calculator. So let me scroll down a little bit. And so if I do 28 divided by 125, I get 0.224. They said round your answers to the nearest hundredth. So this is 0.22. No accident within the last year, 97 divided by 125. So 97 divided by 125 is equal to, let's see, here if I rounded the nearest hundredth, I'm going to round up 0.78. So this is 0.78. Then 35 divided by 139, 35 divided by 139 is equal to, round to the nearest hundredth, 0.25. And then 104 divided by 139. 104 divided by 139 gets me, if I rounded the nearest hundredth, 0.75. And I can check my answer and I got it right. But the key thing here is to make sure we understand what's going on here. So one way to think about this is 22% of the sport utility vehicles had an accident within the last year. Or you could say 0.22 of them. And you could say 78% or 0.78 of the sport utility vehicles had no accidents. Likewise, you could say 25% of the sports cars had an accident within the last year. And 75% did not have an accident in the last year. So it allows you to think more in terms of the relative frequencies, the whole, the percentages, however you want to think about it. Well, this gives you the actual numbers.
