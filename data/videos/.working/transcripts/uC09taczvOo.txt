Plot the following numbers on the number line. So the first number we have here is 5. And so 5 is 5 to the right of 0. 5 is right over there. That's our 5. Then we get 1 third. So 1 third is between 0 and 1. And we can actually split this into thirds. So that would be 1 third, 2 thirds, and then 3 thirds, which is 1. So 1 third is going to sit right over there. It's 1 third of the way from 0 to 1. That's 1 third. Let me write that. That's 1 third right over there. Then we have negative 1.2. I'll do that in this blue color. Negative 1.2. So negative 1 is right over here. This is more negative than negative 1. It's negative 1.2. It's negative 1, and then another 0.2. So it's going to be right over here. So this is negative 1.2. 0 is pretty straightforward. 0 is right over there. It's even labeled for us at 0. 5 was labeled for us too at 5. We have negative 2 and 1 fourth. So let's go to negative 2. Negative 2 is here. And it's going to be more negative than negative 2. It's negative 2 and then another negative 1 fourth. So it's negative 2 and then we go 1 fourth of the way to negative 3. So negative 2 and 1 fourth is going to be right over here. So negative 2 and 1 fourth. And then finally we have 4.1. So 4 is right over here. 0.1 is another tenth greater than 4. Another tenth on the way to 5. So 4 and 1 tenth is going to be right over here. 4.1. And we are done.
