The volume of a cube is equal to its length times its width times its height. A cube with side x has length x with x and height x. So its volume is equal to x times x times x, or x to the third. Shane takes a big cube of butter with side length 5 from the fridge. So I'm assuming, well, they're not giving us the units. Maybe it's 5 centimeters. With side length 5 from the fridge, maybe I'll go with 5 centimeters. That seems reasonable. Then he cuts out a little cube of side length 2 from one of the corners of the cube. Write an expression that describes the volume of butter left. So let's think about it. The original volume of butter that was, let's say, they're saying side length 5. I'm visualizing it as 5 centimeters. Its volume was going to be 5 times 5 times 5, which we could just write as 5 to the third power. And then he takes out another. He takes out a little chunk from that. And the chunk, the volume that he takes out, is the volume of that little cube. And that little cube has side length 2. So its volume is going to be 2 times 2 times 2. Or another way of writing that is 2 to the third power. So it's going to be 5 to the third minus 2 to the third.
