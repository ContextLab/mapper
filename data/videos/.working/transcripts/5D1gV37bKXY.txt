Let's say that we have four siblings right over here, and they're trying to decide how to pick who should do the dishes each night. And so the oldest sibling right over here, he decides, well look, I'll just put all of our names into a bowl, and then I'll just randomly pick one of our names out of the bowl each night, and then that person is going to be, so this is the bowl right over here, and I'm just gonna put four sheets of paper in there, each of them's gonna have one of their names, and then he's just going to randomly pick it out and then that's the person who's going to do their dishes. So they all say, well you know, that seems like a reasonably fair thing to do, and so they start that process. So let's say that after the first three nights that he, the oldest brother here, let me call him Bill, let's say after three nights, Bill has not had to do the dishes. So at that point, the rest of the siblings are starting to think maybe, just maybe something fishy is happening. So what I want to think about is, what is the probability of that happening? What's the probability of three nights in a row Bill does not get picked? If we assume that we were randomly taking, if Bill was truly randomly taking these things out of the bowl and not cheating in some way, what's the probability that that would happen? That three nights in a row, Bill would not be picked. I encourage you to pause the video and think about that. Well let's think about the probability that Bill's not picked on a given night. If it's truly random, so we're going to assume that Bill's not cheating. So assume truly random, truly random, and that each of the sheets of paper have a one in four chance of being picked. What's the probability that Bill does not get picked? Well there's, so let me, the probability that, I guess let me write this, Bill not picked on a night. Well there's four equally likely outcomes, and three of them result in Bill not getting picked. So there's a three fourths probability that Bill is not picked on a given night. Well what's the probability that Bill's not picked three nights in a row? Let me write that down. So the probability, Bill not picked three nights, nights in a row. Well that's the probability that he's not picked on the first night, times the probability that he's not picked on the second night, times the probability that he's not picked on the third night. So that's going to be three to the third power, or three times three times three, so that's 27 over four to the third power. Four times four times four is 64, and if we want to express that as a decimal, so that is 27, let me get my calculator out, that is 27 divided by 64 is equal to, and I'll just round to the nearest hundredth right here, 0.42, so that is equal to 0.42. And so this doesn't seem that unlikely. It's a little less likely than kind of even odds, but it's not, you wouldn't question someone's credibility if there's a 42%, roughly a 42% chance that three nights in a row Bill would not be picked. So this seems like if you're assuming truly random, that it's a reasonable, your hypothesis that it's truly random seems, there's a good chance that you're right, there's a 42% chance you would have the outcome you saw if your assumption is true. But let's say you keep doing this, and you trust your older brother, why would he want to cheat out his younger siblings? But let's say that Bill's not picked 12 nights in a row. So then everyone's starting to get a little bit suspicious with Bill right over here. And so they say, well, we're gonna give him the benefit of the doubt, assuming that he's being completely honest, that this is a completely random process, what is the probability that he would not be picked 12 nights in a row? I'll just just write that down. So the probability Bill, and it's really the same stuff that I just wrote up here, I'll just say Bill not picked 12 nights in a row. Well, that's going to be three, you're gonna take 12 3 fourths and multiply them together. It's going to be 3 fourths to the 12th power. And what is this going to be equal to? Well, let's see, if you take, well, 3 fourths is, I'll just write three divided by three, divided by four, which is gonna be 0.75, to the 12th power. Now, this is a much smaller, this is going to be 0.3, I guess we could go to one more decimal place, 0.32, or we could say, so let me get this to 0.032, I should say, which is equal to, so this is approximately equal to, let me write that, which is equal to 3.2%. So now you have every right to start thinking that something is getting fishy. You could say, well, look, if there was, and this is what statisticians actually do, they often define a threshold, hey, if the probability of this happening purely by chance is more than 5%, then I'll say, well, maybe it was happening by chance. But if the probability of this happening purely by chance was, and this is the threshold that statisticians often use is 5%, but that's somewhat arbitrarily defined, but this is a fairly low probability that it would happen fairly by chance. So you might be tempted to reject the hypothesis, to reject the hypothesis that it was truly random, that Bill is cheating in some way. And you could imagine, if it wasn't 12 in a row, if it was 20 in a row, then this probability becomes really, really, really, really, really small, and so your hypothesis that it's truly random starts to really come into doubt.
