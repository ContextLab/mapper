I think most of us know what the heart does in our body. It pumps the blood. And in particular, it takes in the blood from the rest of the body. And it's blue over here in this diagram, because that blood does not carry oxygen. And it pumps that blood to the lungs, where that blood gets oxygenated. It gets oxygen. And then it comes back from the lungs. And then they depict it as red blood, now that it has oxygen in it. And then that oxygenated blood is then pumped to the rest of the body. And I think also most of us have this general idea that when people talk about heart disease or heart attacks, which we'll learn are two different things related, but different things, that it has something to do with the clogging of arteries. And so when I was a kid and I first learned about the clogging of arteries and I knew enough to know that the heart is all about pumping blood through the body, I assumed that the arteries that people were talking about were these big arteries, the arteries that are coming away from the heart to the rest of the body, that somehow these things got clogged up. So let me draw that a different color you could see. So this is what I thought people were talking about when they were saying clogging of the arteries. And maybe once this got clogged enough, it stopped the blood flow to the rest of the body somehow, and that that would actually kill the person. And what I want to make very clear right now is that those are not the arteries that people are talking about getting clogged when people talk about heart disease or heart attacks. The arteries that they are talking about are the arteries that actually provide blood to the heart. Remember, the heart itself is a muscle. It itself needs oxygen. And so you have these arteries right over here. So these red tubes that are depicted on this picture, those are arteries. And then the blue ones are veins. They're taking the deoxonated blood away from the muscle tissue of the heart. And these are called coronary arteries. At least from the point of view of me or you, it looks like it's on the right. But from the point of view of the person whose heart it is, this is on the left. And so this right over here is called the left coronary artery, or the LCA. And this right over here in red, this is called the right coronary artery, or the RCA. And so when people talk about arteries getting blocked or arteries getting clogged, they're talking about the coronary arteries. They're talking about the things that supply the blood to the heart. And so let's zoom in on one of them. So maybe we could zoom in right over here. So if we zoom in right over here, that part of an artery, that's the tube. Let me zoom in, make it a little bit clearer where I am zooming in. So I am zooming in right over there. So over time, and I'm not going to go into the details of how this happens. That's maybe a subject for another video. You can have these plaques build up along the walls of the artery. So if you zoom in over time, if the person doesn't have the right diet, or maybe they just have a predisposition to it, you can have these things called plaques form on the walls of the arteries. And the plaques, the material inside of them are lipids, so things like fat, cholesterol, and also dead white blood cells. So it's this kind of messy substance right over here. And this is what we call a plaque. And the formation of these plaques that obstruct the actual blood vessel, that actually obstruct the artery, we call this, let me make it clear that you see that this is kind of a tube right over here. Let me draw the blood. So this formation of a plaque, we call atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis. And so you can imagine, if you have these things build up, it's narrowing the actual vessel that's supplying blood downstream from that obstruction. So it would be disrupting the blood flow downstream. So it would be disrupting the blood flow right over there. And that general process that we talk about of that restriction of blood flow, that ischemia that's happening. So ischemia is a deprivation of blood flow and oxygen downstream from this right over there. That's what we call coronary artery disease or heart disease. So let me write this down. So this causes coronary artery disease, which is sometimes called heart disease. Think coronary heart disease would be redundant, because coronary is also already referring to the heart. So another way, this is also sometimes called heart disease. And so you can imagine, if downstream the muscle tissue is not getting all the oxygen it needs, especially maybe when this person's whoever's heart this is, when they're exerting themselves, they need more oxygen, the heart needs to pump a little bit harder. If downstream these cells are not getting all of the oxygen they need, you can imagine that the heart maybe is not able to provide all of the functions that whoever's heart this is that they need it to do. And when that happens, that's called heart failure. So heart disease is one of the causes of heart failure. Now I want to be clear, heart failure does not mean that the heart is stopping, that the heart is stopped and that the person is dead. It literally just means that the heart is failing to do what it should be doing. It's failing to provide the needs of that person. So it's not pumping hard enough or it's not pumping well enough to provide, I guess, adequate function for that person. The other symptom that actually might occur when someone has coronary artery disease, where they have this obstruction, where you have this ischemia, this deprivation of oxygen downstream from this obstruction, is that they might experience this kind of strangling chest pain. And that's called angina pectoris. Sometimes angina. Very few people say the pectoris part. You'll sometimes hear people say, oh, he has angina. That could also lead to angina pectoris, which is really chest pain. And angina literally comes from the strangling feeling. And then the pectoris is in the chest. So it's literally a strangling feeling in a chest. And this is a symptom of heart disease. Now this is already not a situation you want to get into, because already your body is not able to function as well as it maybe could be. As well as it could. So what I've just described here is a plaque. But some plaques are actually unstable. So this plaque could just grow and grow and grow. And it would make probably the heart disease worse and worse and the heart failure worse and the angina pectoris worse. But if this plaque is unstable, it can actually rupture. So you can imagine all this blood flow as this plaque grows. The blood flow becomes a little turbulent around it. The blood flow becomes turbulent around this plaque. I'm drawing the blood kind of, because it has to go really fast through this narrow section. And then it comes out turbulent on the other side. It could create all of these frictions and all the rest. And at some point, you could imagine that this plaque is unstable. And it could actually rupture. So let me draw a ruptured plaque over here. So let me try to draw the same one. But I'm going to draw it ruptured. So now this plaque has ruptured. It got so big. And maybe the turbulent blood flow helped stimulate this and whatever else. But at some, whatever reason, it ruptures. And when it ruptures, now all of a sudden, and I'm doing a simplification of the process right over here. Now all of a sudden, the contents of this plaque, the lipids, the cholesterol, the fats, the dead white blood cells, are now all of a sudden exposed to the blood flow. And in particular, the clotting factors in the blood. And this is highly thrombogenic material. Thrombogenic. Very fancy word, thrombogenic. But that just means that it tends to cause blood clots. So thrombosis is a blood clot. So what happens is as soon as this type of thing happens, and it could literally happen in seconds or even minutes, all of a sudden, you could have these clotting factors form a clot right over here, right at the actual plaque. And as this happens, it starts to really, really, really obstruct the blood vessel. And sometimes it could even completely obstruct the blood vessel. And when this happens, you are significantly depleting the blood flow going downstream from there. Or you might even be shutting it off. And when you do that, the cells downstream will no longer get oxygen, and they will die. And this right over here is called an infarction. So that is an infarction. An infarct is actually dead heart tissue. And so you can imagine once heart tissue begins to die, so then when the heart tissue begins to die, this is even worse than what we were describing with coronary artery disease. Now not only were they with coronary artery disease, they're just not getting enough oxygen. Now they're actually dead. They're turning into dead tissue. And this process of completely or almost completely or completely depriving cells of oxygen so that they die, this is a heart attack. This right over here. So let me completely obstruct this artery to make the point clear. This right over here is a heart attack. This is the primary cause of a heart attack. It's less likely, but sometimes a plaque could also go downstream and kind of form a thromboembolism. So it would be a clot. It would be this thrombogenic material that clots around it. And then it would actually go and block an artery further downstream and be an embolism. And so that could also block the artery and cause tissue to die. But the main cause is just this intense clotting that can occur pretty quickly and completely obstruct the artery. Now there's one last word I want to touch on, because it sometimes is mixed in with all of these other words. And that is cardiac arrest. And that's because sometimes they're used in the same context. And these things can lead. One thing can lead to another. But cardiac arrest, a heart attack is not cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is the actual dying of the heart. What I've just described in a heart attack, people can have a heart attack. They will have some part of their muscle tissue die, some part in infarct. And that's why they call it a myocardial infarction. Myocardium is the tissue of the heart, is the muscle of the heart. And it is dying. So sometimes a heart attack is called a myocardial infarction. That is not cardiac arrest. Because you can have some of your heart tissue die, and you can survive. Your heart will be impaired, but you will continue to live. Cardiac arrest is literally your heart stopping. And this would obviously cause someone to die. So cardiac arrest is literally your heart stopping. So if you have a bad enough heart attack, if you have enough of your tissue get starved of oxygen so that it dies, so that infarction occurs, then it could lead to cardiac arrest. But it always won't lead to cardiac arrest. And frankly, a heart attack is not the only thing that can cause cardiac arrest. And I also once again want to differentiate cardiac arrest from heart failure. Because they sound the same. Sounds like the heart is failing. But cardiac arrest is the heart stopping. Heart failure is essentially just saying that the heart cannot provide all of the needs for the body.
