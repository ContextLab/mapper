We're told the number line represents the total number of trees planted during a community event. All right, so they put the dot there and it looks like they're counting by 10s. We have 8,210, 8,220, 8,230, and 8,240 and it keeps going and we're between 8,230 and 8,240. And then they say about how many trees were planted. And in every one of these choices, they are giving us either 8,230 or they're giving 8,240. And then they're trying to get us to pick which reason is the reason why you would pick one of those. So why don't you pause this video and work on this on your own before we do this together. Okay, so the way I'm going to approach it is I'm just going to look at this number line and think about which of the 10s is it closer to? Is it closer to 8,230? Or is it closer to 8,240? And we can see that the dot is more than halfway from 8,230 to 8,240. And so it's clearly closer to 8,240. And so that's the choice I'm going to go with. And let's see if the rationale or the reason makes sense. 8,240 trees because the point is more than halfway between 8,230 and 8,240. That's exactly what I said. We know it's not 8,230, but they gave two different reasons for that wrong answer. We're clearly closer to 8,240.
