Let's see what it's like to add multi-digit numbers in binary. So let's say I had the number 1, 0, 1, 1. And to that, I wanted to add the number 1, 1, 1. What is that going to be? And I encourage you to pause this video and try to work through it on your own. So the key here is to just do this as a standard algorithm when you're adding numbers, but remind yourself you're only restricted to the 0 and 1 digits. So let's do that. So we have 1 plus 1. Well, you might say that's 2, but you can't write a 2 here. We only can write a 0 or 1. And we have to remind ourselves that 2 in decimal is represented as 1, 0 in binary. It's 1, 2, and 0, 1s. So you write the 0, 0, 1s, and 1, 2. You essentially carry the 1. And now you have 1 plus 1 plus 1. Well, that's going to be 3, but you can't write 3 once again. 3 in decimal is equal to 1, 1 in binary. It's 1, 2 plus 1, 1 is 3. And so you just have to realize that. So 1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3, which in binary is 1, 1. So you write 1 in the 1s place, and then you carry it. And then we want to add what we're doing in the 4s place. And over here, I have a 1 in a 1, which is going to be 2, which we already know we represent as 1, 0. So you write 0 here, and then you carry the 1. And then once again, 1 and 1 is 2, which is 1, 0 in binary. And we're done. We've just added these numbers. Now you might be saying, hey, let me make sure that this actually makes sense. And we can verify that this actually makes sense by thinking about what these numbers are. Remember, this is going to be, this number right over here, if we wanted to think of it in decimal, is going to be 1 plus 2 plus not 4, but plus 8. So this is 11 if we were to write it in decimal. And this right over here is 1 plus 2 plus 4, which is equal to 7 if we were to write it in decimal. And now what's this right over here? This is equal to 1, 2. This is 4, 8, 16. So this right over here, so we have 1, 16, plus 1, 2 is going to be equal to, this is equal to 18 if we were writing it in decimal. And we see that. 11 plus 7 is indeed equal to 18. 11 plus 7 is indeed equal to 18.
