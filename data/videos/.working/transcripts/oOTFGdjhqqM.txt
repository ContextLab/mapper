So I have this big rectangle here that's divided into four smaller rectangles. So what I want to do is I want to express the area of this larger rectangle, and I want to do it two ways. The first way I want to express it as the product of two binomials, and then I want to express it as a trinomial. So let's think about this a little bit. So one way to say, well look, the height of this larger rectangle from here to here, we see that that distance is x, and then from here to here it's two, so the entire height right over here, the entire height right over here is going to be x plus two. So the height is x plus two, and what's the width? Well, the width is, we go from there to there is x, and then from there to there is three. So the entire width is x plus three. X plus three. So just like that, I've expressed the area of the entire rectangle, and it's the product of two binomials. But now let's express it as a trinomial. Well, to do that we can break down the larger area into the areas of each of these smaller rectangles. So what's the area of this purple rectangle right over here? Well, the purple rectangle, its height is x, and its width is x, so its area is x squared. Let me write that, that's x squared. What's the area of this yellow rectangle? Well, its height is x, same height as right over here. Its height is x, and its width is three. So it's gonna be x times three, or three x. It'll have an area of three x. So that area is three x. So if we're summing up the area of the entire thing, this would be plus three x. So this expression right over here, that's the area of this purple region plus the area of this yellow region. And then we can move on to this green region. What's the area going to be here? Well, the height is two, and the width is x. So multiplying height times width is gonna be two times x. And we can just add that, plus two times x. And then finally, this little gray box here, its height is two, we see that right over there. Its height is two, and its width is three. We see it right over there. So it has an area of six, two times three. So plus six, and you might say, well, this isn't a trinomial. This has four terms right over here. But you might notice that we can add, that we can add these middle two terms. Three x plus two x. I have three x's, and I add two x's to that. I'm gonna have five x's. So this entire thing simplifies to x squared, x squared plus five x plus six. So this and this are two ways of expressing the area. So they're going to be equal. And that makes sense, because if you multiply it out, these binomials, and simplified, you would get this trinomial. We could do that really fast. You multiply the x times the x. Actually, let me do it in the same colors. You multiply the x times the x. You get the x squared. You multiply this x times the three. You get your three x. You multiply the two times the x. You get your two x. And then you multiply the two times the three, and you get your six. So what this, because you can see this area model does for us, is it hopefully makes a visual representation of why it makes sense to multiply binomials the way we do. In other videos, we talk about it as applying the distribution property twice. This gives you a more visual representation for why it actually makes sense.
