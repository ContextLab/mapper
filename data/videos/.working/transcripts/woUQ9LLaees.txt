20 teachers were asked about their favorite course. 7 teachers said language, 3 teachers said history, 9 teachers said geometry, 1 teacher said chemistry, 0 teachers said physics. Create a bar chart showing everyone's favorite courses. So we've got the bar chart right over here and let's see what we need to plot. So it said 0 teachers said physics, which is surprising to me, because physics is arguably my favorite course. But let's plot what the data has. So physics, right now it looks like it's halfway between 0 and 1, so I actually have to bring the physics down to 0. Chemistry, let's see, 1 teacher said chemistry, so we've got to bring chemistry up to 1. Now, 9 teachers said geometry, so geometry, let's bring that up to 9. 1 teacher said chemistry, oh I already read that, history, history, 3 teachers said history, so let's bring history up to 3. And then language, 7 teachers said language, so let's move this up to 7. And I think we, if I didn't make any careless mistakes, we should be done. Yep, very good.
