Most liquids, when cooled, will simply shrink. Water, on the other hand, actually expands when it is frozen. Its volume will increase by about 9%. Suppose you have 1 third of a gallon of water that gets frozen, what is the volume of the ice that you now have? So you're starting with 1 third of a gallon of water. And they tell us that when it gets frozen, when it turns into ice, its volume is going to expand by 9%. So the new volume is going to be your existing volume. So this is the original volume, 1 third of a gallon. And it's going to expand by 9%. So your frozen volume is going to be your original volume plus 9% of your original volume. So plus 9% of your original volume. So you could say it's 9% times 1 third. So this right over here is going to be the expanded volume. Now, there's a bunch of ways we can figure it out. We could turn things to decimals or whatever else. But they tell us to express your answer as a fraction. So let's make sure that everything here is a fraction. And then we'll just try to simplify. So the one thing that's sitting here that is not a fraction is our 9%. Well, what does 9% actually represent? Well, 9% literally means 9 per 100. So we can rewrite this as, so this is going to be equal to 1 third plus, instead of writing 9%, I'll write that as 9 per 100. And then once again, times 1 third. Times 1 third. And we can simplify this expression right over here. We have a 9 in the numerator, a 3 in the denominator. If we divide both of them by 3, we get a 3 and a 1. And so we're left with 1 third plus 3 hundreds times 1 over 1. Well, that's just going to be 3 hundreds. So this is just going to be equal to 1 over 3 plus, I'll write this in orange still, or maybe I'll do it in a new color, plus 3 over 100. And now we have to add something with, or two numbers that have different denominators. So this is going to be equal to, well, the least common multiple of 3 and 100, and they share no common factors, so it's really just going to be the product of 3 and 100. The least common multiple is 300. So it's going to be something over 300 plus something over 300. Now to go from 3 to 300 in the denominator, you multiply by 100. So you have to multiply the numerator by 100 as well. So 1 third is the same thing as 100 over 300. And to go from 100 to 300, we had to multiply by 3 in the denominator. So we have to multiply by 3 in the numerator as well. So 3 hundreds is the same thing as 9 3 hundreds. And now we're ready to add. This is going to be 100 plus 9 over 300, which is 109 over 300. So this is the volume of ice that I now have expressed as a fraction.
