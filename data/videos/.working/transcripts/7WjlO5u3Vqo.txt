Whenever I want to have a salute come up with a solution to a problem and I don't have it, my immediate like reaction is to go outside and go on a walk. I love walking in all kinds of weather. It's kind of, it's just, I feel like with the peace and calm, like getting away, moving away from the problem and stepping away from it, sometimes I get way better ideas and it inspires me. But I also think there's something to be said about not being inspired. Like not always as amazing. I feel like sometimes I get struck with inspiration for how I want to explain a Khan Academy video or how I want to approach a piece of art or how I want to approach a math problem. But sometimes it doesn't come. And so I feel like what the best solution is when you are trying to get into that creative zone and you can't, is just do it and try to do something anyway. Like write something or write your equations, try to figure it out. And if you make mistakes, that's okay. And because it's something to jump off of. And maybe sometimes seeing what you already know down on paper can help you come up with better ideas and could help you be more creative. Forcing yourself to just conjure a solution simply does not work. Instead, take a break from the task. Pick something else up like physical sport or even video games and then come back to the original problem that can do wonders.
