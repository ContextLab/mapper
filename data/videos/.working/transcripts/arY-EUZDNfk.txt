Alan found four marbles to add to his five marbles currently in his pocket. He then had a competition with his friends and tripled his marbles. Write a numerical expression to model the situation without performing any operations. So let's think about what's going on. So he already had five marbles in his pocket. And then he found four more marbles to add to that. So we can add the four marbles to the five marbles. So four marbles plus the five marbles. So that's what happens after the first sentence. He found four marbles to add to his five marbles currently in his pocket. He then had a competition with his friends and tripled his marbles. So this is how many marbles he had before tripling. And now he's tripling. Now he's tripling his marbles. So he'd want to multiply three times the total number of marbles he has now. Times four plus five. So this right over here is the numerical expression that models the situation without performing any operations. We, of course, could then actually calculate this. He has nine marbles before tripling. And then you multiply it by three and he has 27. But this is what they're asking for. They want us to write this expression.
