So this right over here is a screenshot of the describing subsets of sample spaces exercised on Khan Academy. And I thought I would do a couple of examples just because it's good practice just thinking about how do we describe sets and subsets. So it reads, Harry Potter is at Ollivander's wand shop. As we all know, the wand must choose the wizard. So Harry cannot make the choice himself. He interprets the wand selection as a random process so he can compare the probabilities of different outcomes. The wood types available are holly, elm, maple, and wenge. Wenge? Wenge? The core materials on offer are phoenix feather, unicorn hair, dragon scale, raven feather, and thestral tail. All right. Based on the sample space of possible outcomes listed below, what is more likely? And so we see here we have four different types of woods for the wand, and then each of those could be combined with five different types of core. Phoenix feather, unicorn hair, dragon scale, raven feather, and thestral tail. And so that gives us four different woods, and each of those can be combined for five different cores. 20 possible outcomes. And they don't say it here, but the way they're talking, I guess we can, I'm gonna go with the assumption that they're equally likely outcomes, although it would have been nice if they said that these are all equally likely, but these are the 20 outcomes. And so which of these are more likely? The wand that selects Harry will be made of holly or unicorn hair. So how many of those outcomes involve this? So holly are these five outcomes, and if you said holly or unicorn hair, it's gonna be these five outcomes plus, well this one involves unicorn hair, but we've already included this one. But the other ones that's not included for the holly that involve unicorn hair are the elm unicorn, the maple unicorn, and the wenge unicorn. So it's these five plus these three right over here. So eight of these 20 outcomes. And if these are all equally likely outcomes, that means there's an eight-twentieth probability of a wand that will be made of holly or unicorn hair. So this is eight-twentieth, so that's the same thing as four-tenths, or 40% chance. Now the wand that selects Harry will be made of holly and unicorn hair. Well holly and unicorn hair, that's only one out of the 20 outcomes. So this of course is going to be a higher probability. It actually includes this outcome, and then seven other outcomes. So this is, the first choice is this includes the outcome for the second choice plus seven other outcomes. So this is definitely going to be a higher probability. Let's do a couple more of these, or at least one more of these. You and a friend are playing fire, water, sponge. I've never played that game. In this game, each of the two players chooses fire, water, or sponge. Both players reveal their choice at the same time, and the winner is determined based on the choices. I guess this is like rock, paper, scissors. Fire beats sponge by burning it. Sponge beats water by soaking it up. And water beats fire by putting it out. Alright, well that kind of makes sense. If both players choose the same object that is a tie, all the possible outcomes of the game are listed below. If we take outcomes one, three, four, five, seven, and eight as a subset of the sample space, which of the following statements, which of the statements below describe this subset? So let's look at the outcomes that they have over here. Well it makes sense that there are nine possible outcomes because for each of the three choices I can make, there's going to be three choices that my friend can make. So three times three is nine. Let's see, they've highlighted these red outcomes. Outcome one, three, four, five, seven, and eight. So let's see what's common about them. Outcome one, fire, I get fire, friend gets water. Okay, so let's see, my friend would win. Outcome three, I pick fire, my friend does sponge. So actually I would win that one. And then outcome four, water, fire. And then outcome five, water, sponge. Sponge, huh, these are all, I don't see a pattern just yet. Let's look at the choices. The subset consists of all outcomes where your friend does not win. All outcomes where your friend does not win. Well that's not true because look, outcome one, outcome one, my friend wins, water puts out fire. So that's, we're not going to select this first choice. So let's see, the subset consists of all the outcomes where your friend wins or there's a tie. So let's see, where the friend wins or there's a tie. Well outcome three, this is one where, this is an outcome where I would win. Where are you or whoever your is, whoever they're talking about. This is one where the friend doesn't win because fire burns sponge. So I'm not going to select that one either. Choice three, the subset consists of all of the outcome where you win or there's a tie. Well we just said outcome one, I don't win that. My friend wins that, water puts out the fire. Now it's the last choice. The subset consists of all the outcomes where there is not a tie. Alright, so this is interesting. Because look, outcome two, there is a tie. Outcome six, there is a tie. Outcome nine, there is a tie. And there's actually only three scenarios where there's a tie. Either it's fire, fire, water, water, or sponge, sponge. And those are the ones that are not selected. So all of these, someone is going to win. Outcome one, three, four, five, seven, or eight. So definitely, definitely go with that one.
