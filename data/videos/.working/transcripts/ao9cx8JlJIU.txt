Handsome Jack is buying a pony made of diamonds. The price of the pony is P dollars and Jack also has to pay a 25% diamond pony tax. Match the expressions to their meaning for Handsome Jack and they say multiple expressions may fit in the same description. Alright so in this bucket we have the price of the diamond pony before tax. Well they already tell us that the price of the diamond pony is P dollars. So that's P right over here. Now over here they say the amount of tax Handsome Jack pays. Well he pays a 25% diamond pony tax. So whatever the price is he's gonna pay 25% of that or another way of thinking about it he's gonna pay 25% is the same thing as 0.25. So 0.25 times P is the amount of tax he's going to pay on this diamond pony. Now they say Handsome Jack's total bill for the diamond pony. Well he's gonna pay P for the pony plus 0.25 P in taxes. So that is this one right over here P for the pony plus 0.25 P for the taxes. So that's that one over there. But if we look at this you could view this literally as 1 P plus 0.25 P. Well that's the same thing as 1.25 P. So that's the same thing as this right over here. So it's 1.25 P and these other three don't seem to fit in any of these categories. So I'm gonna put it into the not used. We're required to categorize everything. So let me put this in the not used. It's falling off the screen I realize. So let me put this in the not used and then let me put this in the not used. Let's check our answer. We got it right.
