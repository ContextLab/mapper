Let's draw Lewis draw structures for certain molecules. It's a lot of fun to do that. Okay. Now the first thing we need to do to Draw these structures is to identify the number of valence electrons Okay, and we've talked about these valence electrons in our previous videos, but this is such a central concept So just let's quickly recap Valence electrons represents the number of electrons in the outermost shell. Okay, and if we bring up our periodic table then The valence electrons for all the elements belonging to a particular group is given this way So the first group will have the elements of the first group will have one valence electron The elements of the second group will have two electrons and it's outermost shell two valence electrons and so on and so forth When it comes to group 18 helium is an exception. It has two valence electrons, but the rest of them will have eight Valence electrons eight electrons and it's outermost shell Okay, and just to get a sneak peek of why this is the case Well, here are some structures of some of the elements you can see hydrogen one electron is out of a shell Lithium one electron is out of a shell sodium just total of 11 electrons But one electron and it's outermost shell same thing will continue. Okay, but what about the elements of these group? What about their valence electrons? Well, we don't have to worry about them because we're drawing structures for molecules that are formed by covalent bonds meaning bonds formed by Caring of electrons now metals which I've drawn in red. Okay, they usually do not participate in covalent bonds Okay It's only the non metals that usually do that and the non metals are in green and you can see all the valence electrons for the Non metals we already have them. So we only got to worry about them and not worry too much about these Okay. All right with that recap. Let's now draw the Lewis structure for hydrogen So the first step is how many valence electrons is hydrogen have it has one valence electron? So let's write that one valence electron and now Hydrogen would love to have two electrons because it'll make it stable in its outermost shell And how do I know that because if I look at helium look helium has two electrons and it doesn't bond with anybody Because helium is stable all noble gases are stable That's how I know hydrogen will love to have two electrons in its outermost shell now That means it needs one more electron and here's the thing if it needs one more electron It's gonna say hey, I'm gonna share one electron if you need one you share one Okay, so hydrogen says hey, I'm willing to share my one valence electrons It's gonna share one electron and if somebody else is willing to share their one valence electron is gonna form a nice bond with them Okay, that's why it forms a bond with itself. And so now we can draw the structure this way so here's the hydrogen and here is the The valence electron it's ready to share that here's another hydrogen Here's the valence electrons gonna ready to share that and look they're gonna form a bond This is called the covalent bond and by sharing each atom has access to two electrons making them both stable That's why they stay together Okay, covalent bond. How do we draw the Lewis structure the final structure? Well, we just gonna we're just gonna represent this bond with a single line So a single line represents a bond between two electrons. Okay, this is the Lewis dot structure for hydrogen Okay, let's take another example. Let's take oxygen If I go over here oxygen has six villains electrons, that's where we start oxygen has six villains electron and How many does it need to attain stability? Well, if you look at neon then you can see that it has eight electrons out of more shell and I know neon is very stable So that helps me understand that eight electrons in the outermost shell gives you stability In fact, that is the case for most other elements for hydrogen It's two but for most other elements they require eight other elect eight electrons in its outermost shell We call this the octet rule. All right So since oxygen requires eight electrons and it's out of more shell it has six So it needs two more if you need to you share to that's the rule. Okay, so it's going to share two electrons And if somebody else is willing to share their two electrons, it's gonna fall bond with them. That's why it forms a bond itself Okay So how do we do that? Well again, we're gonna draw two. So we're gonna draw the Lewis structure we're gonna draw two oxygen atoms and Now since it has six wins electron, here's how I show the villains electrons. Okay, one two three four Five six, why do I draw it this way because just by drawing it this way again You can see just from the start structure that there's one pair. There's a second pair. Oh, there's no pair here Oh, there's no pair over here. These electrons are lonely They want to get paired and that's how I know that these two electrons are going to participate in bonding It's gonna be shared. So just by looking at the dot structure I can see that it's going to share two electrons That's another way to just confirm the same thing that we got over here. Okay, so it's gonna share these two electrons This oxygen atoms gonna do the same thing one two three four five six It's gonna share these two which means these two electrons and these two electrons can form a bond Now just to make it a little convenient for me to draw this I'm gonna show the lonely electron here I'm gonna show the pair over here. You can draw the pair wherever you want Okay, it just makes it so much convenient to draw bonds over here so this means these two electrons are gonna form a bond over here and These two electrons are gonna form a bond over here and There you have it. That means oxygen is gonna form a double bond and you can count the number of Because of this covalent bond you can count the number of Electrons each oxygen has access to now if you look at this oxygen it has one two three four five six seven eight It has eight electrons access to it and this oxygen one two three four five six seven eight It has also eight electrons access to and so octet rule is satisfied. And so now how do we draw the final Lewis structure? Well, here's the oxygen atoms one and two so two bonds two lines and Then we have to show the lone pairs These are called lone pairs because they do not participate in bonding, but it's important to show them So here's the lone pairs you can show the lone pairs wherever you want Okay, but do show them in the Lewis dot structure and there you have it. That is a dot structure All right, your turn. Why don't you try drawing a Lewis dot structure for n2? Why don't you pause the video and get a try? All right. Here we go. Again, I look at nitrogen over here and I know that nitrogen has five valence electrons That's where you always start number of valence electrons and octet rule remember most elements for the octet rule So it requires eight electrons and its outermost shell for stability. It has five so it needs three more if you need three you share three So it shares Three electrons and again if it can find some other atom or elements that can share three electrons It will happily bond with them. That's why it bonds forms a bond with itself. And so how are we gonna show that? Same way so we're gonna draw the five valence electrons over here in the same way. We wrote it over here 1 2 3 4 5 and again, you can see just by drawing the dot structure We can see there's one pair over here, but there are three lonely electrons which would love to participate in bonding That's why it shares three electrons just by looking at the dot structure. You can confirm that same thing over here 1 2 3 4 5 So these three electrons can bond with these three and again just to make it a little convenient to draw Okay, I'm gonna Sorry, I'm gonna draw that pair over here and I'm gonna draw that pair over here All right, and of course the more practice we get the better will be at conveniently drawing them Okay, but anyways now that we have these three electrons They can form a bond with each other and so bond number one bond number two bond number three So nitrogen forms a triple bond with itself And again, if you count the number of electrons this nitrogen has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 And for this nitrogen again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 octet rule is satisfied So what does the Lewis dot structure final structure look like? well, I have three bonds so it's gonna be a triple bond and Then do not forget the lone pairs never ever forget the lone pairs Okay and this now explains why nitrogen loves to form three bonds either a triple bond or a double bond with one Element and a single bond with another element or three separate bonds and oxygen for example You lives to form two bonds double bonds with another atom or two single bonds. All right, let's kick things up a little bit How about we draw one for water molecules? Mmm things are getting it interesting now The idea is the same though You start with the number of valency electrons for each one and then think about how much they share and then try to form a bond Now, of course because you have three elements over here There could be a little bit confusion about how they're all connected The general rule is the element which is on the leftmost side of the periodic table again If here's a period table look at the one says on the leftmost side Which is least electronegative or you can also think of it as most metallic because the you know All metals are on the left side, right? So the one that is on the leftmost side will usually be the central atom. All right What about hydrogen hydrogen is the leftmost but it is an exception. All right, so hydrogen always be on the side So except for hydrogen any other elements that you have you have to consider the one that's on the leftmost side That will be your central atom will take more examples. It'll make sense But at least when it comes to water since hydrogen always you on the side It's going to the oxygen will be in the center so we can immediately draw the structure so the oxygen will be in the center the two hydrogens will be connected to it and We already know their valence electrons and how much they're going to share So I'm going to write one for oxygens. We'll start with that same technique one two three four five six so it's going to share these two and Hydrogen has just has one and so you can kind of see these two are going to form a bond with these two And again just for convenience. I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this and Put that pair here so that I can nicely bond of these two and there you have it So this is going to be bond number one and this will be bond number two And that's it. That's the structure. So dot structure. So it's going to be oxygen hydrogen hydrogen one bond here one bond here and Do not forget the lone pairs Okay again your turn how about you draw one for NH3 Pause and try Alright, there are four elements over here. But again because hydrogen will always be on the side We know it's the nitrogen which is going to be the central atom and the three hydrogen will be connected to it so Nitrogen will be in the center and the three hydrogen where we can draw the three hydrogens wherever we want So let me just draw them over here. And again, we'll start by drawing the central The valence electrons on the central atom. So one two three four five I know it has five valence electrons. So what do I draw them? I'm gonna draw the fifth one over here you can see that right now we can I can conveniently draw the bonds over here and One valence electron for hydrogen. It's ready to share that so One bond over here One bond over here and one bond over here and this will be the lone pair and again You can check hydrogen has access to two electrons Nitrogen has access to one two three four five six seven eight So is the final structure going to be well, I have n and I have single bond H Single bond H H single bond H. Am I forgetting something? Yes, the lone pair do not forget the lone pairs Alright final challenge carbon dioxide So carbon is a new element for us now Why don't you pause the video look at the periodic table and try to draw the Lewis structure for this one Alright, since carbon is a new one. We need to think about carbon carbon has four valence electrons and It needs four more and therefore so let me just write it down four valence electrons It needs four more if you need four you share four Okay, and now now is the interesting one. I don't have hydrogens. I have carbon and oxygen How do I know which is the element that comes in the center? Well again CO2 might be simpler you might be able to guess it But we're gonna look at which one is the leftmost element and you can see carbon is the leftmost element on the periodic table Oxygen is over here carbon is over here. So carbon comes in the center Alright, so carbon will be in the center and oxygen will be attached to it So I'm gonna draw two oxygen atoms over here and now again, I can draw the Lewis structure for carbon How do I do that? I'm gonna show the four valence electrons one two three four That's all there is and look they're all lonely. They're all four lonely and therefore they're gonna share all four of them to form pairs and The same thing for oxygen as we've done before one two three four Five and six, where should I draw five and six? Well, let me see. I mean you can draw it anywhere, right? So let me draw the five and six Sheer Okay, same thing over here one two three four I'm gonna draw the fifth and the sixth one over here So we can bond this and we can bond this and we can kind of bond this and we can kind of bond this It's a little it's a little crooked, but it's okay. We get the idea across so this is One pair and then you can bond it over here. We can point over here. It's fine. It's fine I know it looks a little weird But we get the gist of it carbon is gonna form a double bond with this oxygen atom and the carbon is also gonna form A double bond with this oxygen atom and let's count carbon has one two three four five six seven eight What about oxygen one two three four five six seven eight and the same thing with this one and so we can now draw a better final structure so carbon oxygen oxygen sing so two bonds or double bond here a double bond over here Do not forget the lone pairs. So there are two lone pairs over here. Let me draw them over here and here and There are two lone pairs over here. Are there any lone pairs on the carbon? No, there are no lone pairs on the carbon So there you have it That was fun, right?
