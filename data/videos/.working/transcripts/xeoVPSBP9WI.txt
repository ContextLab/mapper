We're on the fractions on the number line exercise on Khan Academy, and they ask us to move the orange dot to 3 fourths on the number line. Change the number of divisions to create tick marks on the number line. So let's see what's going on here. So I have the space from zero to one on the number line. If I want to move it to 3 fourths, what I would first want to do is divide the space between zero and one into fourths, into four equal sections. So I would want to have four divisions here. And there you have it, four divisions. I typed in the number four and they have four equal divisions. One, two, three, four. And so this is going to be a fourth, that's another fourth, that's another fourth, and that's another fourth. What we care about is 3 fourths. So once again, that's one fourth. This would be another fourth getting us to 2 fourths. And then this would be another fourth getting us to 3 fourths. So there you have it. That is 3 fourths on the number line.
