Let's give ourselves some practice substituting positive and negative values for variables. So we're told to evaluate x minus negative y, where x is equal to negative two, and y is equal to five. So everywhere we see an x, we could replace with a negative two. Everywhere we see a y, we replace with a five. So this is a y right over here, and then of course, and then of course, this is an x. Let's do that. So instead of that x, let's write negative two. So we have negative two minus, and then we have open parentheses, a negative y. Y is equal to five. Now what is this going to evaluate to? Well, this is the same thing as negative two. Now subtracting a negative five, so all of this business here, subtracting a negative five, that's the same thing as adding a five. It's going to be negative two plus five, which is equal to three. This is going to be equal to three. And there's several ways to think about this. My brain thinks, okay, I'm starting at negative two. If I add two, I get to zero, and then I would have to add another three, so that gets me to three. You could even view this as, you could even view this, my brain kind of says negative two. Well, let's see, I have to add two to get back to zero, and then I have to add another three, if I want to add a total of five. So this is going to be zero plus three, gets me to three. Another way to think about it, negative two plus five is the same thing as five minus two. Five minus two, which is of course equal to three. Or you can of course draw it on a number line. And you would say if you start at negative two, and you take five steps to the right, you get to positive three. Let's do another one of these. This one's a little bit more complex. So let's see, we're told to evaluate three minus negative six plus negative h, plus negative four, where h is equal to negative seven. Well, there's two ways you could do it. I could just take the negative seven and replace it with the h with that negative seven. Or I could actually try to simplify this expression first, and then do the substitution for h. So let's actually do that. My brain feels like doing that. So this expression, I have the three, but instead of subtracting a negative six, instead of subtracting a negative six, that's going to be the same thing as just adding six. So three plus six. And adding a negative h, adding a negative h, adding a negative h, that's the same thing as just subtracting h. So three plus six minus h. And then adding a negative four, adding a negative four, that's the same thing as subtracting four. That's the same thing as subtracting four. And now, of course, we can do this in any, you know, addition and subtraction. We have, we can change the order in which we do it. So let's do that just to kind of simplify all of this. So actually, first of all, I can figure out what three plus six is. Three plus six is equal to nine. And then I have this minus four here. So I could say nine minus four. Actually, I want to be careful not to skip any steps. So three plus six, three plus six, in a color that you can see. So three plus six is nine. So that's nine minus h, minus four, minus four. Now I could change the order in which I do this addition or subtraction. So this is going to be the equivalent of nine minus four, nine minus four, minus h, minus h. And I just did that so I can simplify and figure out what nine minus four is. Nine minus four, of course, let me do some blue, navy blue, nine minus four is five. So this whole thing simplified to five minus h before I even did the substitution. And now I can substitute h with negative seven. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, when I do the substitution, I'll write it up here, it's going to be five minus, I'll do the minus of that magenta color, minus, and now where I see an h, I'm going to replace it with negative seven. Five minus negative seven. You don't want to be very careful there. You might be, oh, I have a negative here, negative here. Let me just replace h with a seven. Remember, h is negative seven. So you're subtracting h. You're going to subtract negative seven. So this is five minus negative seven, which is the same thing, which is the same thing as five plus seven. Five plus seven, which we all know is equal to 12. And we're done. Let's do a few more of these. You can't really get enough practice here. This is some important foundational skills for the rest of your mathematical lives. All right. So consider, I don't want to make you too stressed about it. Consider the following number line. All right, so we got a number line here. Let's see. They didn't mark off all the numbers here. This is negative four. E is at this point. This is, then we go to two. So it looks like we're counting by twos here. This is negative two. This is zero. Yep. Negative four, if you increase by two, negative four, negative two, zero, two, four. This would be a six. This would be a negative six. They intentionally left those numbers off. So we had to figure out that, hey, look. Between negative four and two, to go from negative four to two, you have to increase by six. And we only have one, two, three hash marks. So each of those hash marks must be increasing by two. Well, anyway, now we know, now we know what all the points on the number line are. Evaluate E minus F. Well, we know, we know that E is equal to negative two. And we know, we know that F is equal to four. So this is going to be the same thing. E is equal to negative two minus, minus positive four. Minus positive four, let me do that same blue color. Minus four. Well, negative two minus four, we have the number line in front of us. This is just going to be negative six. If you start at negative two, you subtract, if you subtract two, you get to negative four. You subtract another two, you get to negative six. So we are done. Let's do one more of these. Let's evaluate T plus negative U. Or once again, T and U are on this number line. And it looks like each of these hash marks we're incrementing by three as we go up. Zero, three, six. And if we go down, zero, negative three, negative six. So it's clear that U is equal to three. U is equal to three. And it is also clear that T is equal to negative six. T is equal to negative six. So T plus negative U is going to be, so it's going to be negative six plus, negative six plus negative U. U is three. U is three. You want to be very careful. You might say, oh, well, U is positive, so I'm just going to put a positive number here. But remember, it's negative U. Wherever you see the U, replace it with the three. So it's negative three. So this is going to be six plus negative three. Or sorry, negative six plus negative three. Which we can rewrite as negative six minus three. All of this business could be rewritten as negative six minus three. Negative six minus three. If you're at negative six and you go three to the left, you go three more negative, you're going to end up at negative nine. And we're all done.
