The rectangle below has an area of 12x to the fourth plus 6x to the third plus 15x squared square meters. And we can see the area right over here, and they broke it up. This green area is 12x to the fourth, this purple area is 6x to the third, this blue area is 15x squared. You add them all together, you get this entire rectangle, which would be the combined area, 12x to the fourth plus 6x to the third plus 15x squared. The length of the rectangle in meters, so this is the length right over here that we're talking about. This distance. The length of the rectangle in meters is equal to the greatest common monomial factor of 12x to the fourth, 6x to the third, and 15x squared. What is the length and width of the rectangle? I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. Well, the key realization here is that the length times the width, the length times the width is going to be equal to this area. And if the length is the greatest common monomial factor of these terms, of 12x to the fourth, 6x third, and 15x squared, well then we can factor that out, and then what we have left over is going to be the width. So let's figure out what is the greatest common monomial factor of these three terms. And the first thing we can look at is let's look at the coefficients. Let's figure out what's the greatest common factor of 12, 6, and 15. And there's a couple of ways you could do it. You could do it by looking at a prime factorization. You could say, all right, well, 12 is two times six, which is two times three. That's the prime factorization of 12. Prime factorization of six is just two times three. Prime factorization of 15 is three times five. And so the greatest common factor, the largest factor that's divisible into all of them, so let's see, we can throw a three in there. Three is divisible into all of them. And that's it, because we can't say a three and a two. A three and a two would be divisible into 12 and six, but there's no two that's divisible into 15. We can't say a three and a five, because five is divisible into 12 or six. So the greatest common factor is going to be three. Another way we could have done this is we could have said, what are the non-prime factors of each of these numbers? 12, you could have said, okay, I can get 12 by saying one times 12 or two times six or three times four. Six, you could have said, let's see, that could be one times six or two times three. So those are the factors of six. And then 15, you could have said, well, one times 15 or three times five. And so you say the greatest common factor, well, three is the largest number that I've listed here that is common to all three of these factors. So once again, the greatest common factor of 12, six, and 15 is three. So when we're looking at the greatest common monomial factor, the coefficient is going to be three. And then we look at these powers of x. We have x to the fourth, we have x to the, let me see, a different color. We have x to the fourth, x to the third, and x squared. Well, what's the largest power of x that's divisible into all of those? Well, it's going to be x squared. x squared is divisible into x to the fourth and x to the third, and of course, x squared itself. So the greatest common monomial factor is three x squared. This length right over here, this is three x squared. So if this is three x squared, we can then figure out what the width is. So what's, if we were to divide 12 x to the fourth by three x squared, what do we get? Well, 12 divided by three is four, and x to the fourth divided by x squared is x squared. Notice, three x squared times four x squared is 12 x to the fourth. And then we move over to this purple section. If we take six x to the third divided by three x squared, six divided by three is two, and then x to the third divided by x squared is just going to be x. And then last but not least, we have 15 divided by three is going to be five. x squared divided by x squared is just one, so it's just going to be five. So the width is going to be four x squared plus two x plus five. So once again, the length, we figured that out, is the greatest common monomial factor of these terms. Three x squared, and the width is four x squared plus two x plus five. And one way to think about it is we just factored, we just factored this expression over here. We could write, we could write that, actually, I want to see the original thing. We could write that three x squared times four x squared plus two x plus five, which is the entire width, well, that's going to be equal to the area. That's going to be equal to our original expression, 12 x to the fourth power plus six x to the third plus 15 x squared.
