I'm here with Dr. David Agus, who's a professor of medicine and engineering at University of Southern California. And what are we looking at right over here? So you can see on the right top there is a captain of the British Royal Navy named James Lind. And he was a remarkable guy. I actually did one of the first clinical trials that I'll tell you about in a minute. But in the Battle of Trafalgar, between the British and the French, he did something very clever, in that on his ships, he had fresh fruit. He had limes. Hence the term limies for the British soldiers. What was amazing is that being at a sea for several weeks at a time, the soldiers would all start to develop scurvy, which is a lack of vitamin C. What happens to someone when they have scurvy? So vitamin C is involved in collagen synthesis, which is kind of the scaffolding of the body. So your body starts to degrade. You start to get bleeding gums. Your tissues start to fall apart. And it ends up in death in most people if no vitamin C is given. I see all your connective tissue in your body starts to degrade. It literally starts to degrade. It can't rebuild itself. Wow. So in the late 90s, I was working in the laboratory and I read his book. It's called A Treatise on Scurvy from 1746. And in it, he said that, talked all about doing autopsies in people with scurvy. People my age, and I'm in my 40s, have never seen scurvy ever. So the first time I ever heard about scurvy and what it looked like was reading it. And what he mentioned was that the brain was always intact in people with scurvy. So when I looked to identify how vitamin C worked in the body, what the transporter was, the first place I looked was the brain. And science, it kind of overlooked looking there for this transporter because nobody had read the book in a long time. We cloned, which has identified the gene to allow vitamin C to go in and out of cells. And it's a pretty cool molecule because the vitamin C that you eat is called ascorbic acid. And in order to get into cells, it has to be converted to another molecule called dehydroascorbic acid. But what's amazing is that in the medical textbooks, as late as the 1920s and 30s, they still scurvy an infectious disease. Because at the end of his book, he put a paragraph where he said, I happened to sell the extract of Lyme to prevent scurvy and it didn't work. I see. It didn't work because as soon as you squeeze that Lyme at room temperature, the vitamin C degrades. And so people tried to reproduce what he did and they couldn't. And he was an entrepreneur. He couldn't sell Lyme because everybody had Lyme. He tried to sell the extract of Lyme and it didn't work. So even though he was able to, the clinical trial that he ran was regarding Lyme and scurvy. Yes, he took these nuns and he gave them a diet that had no fruits in it and then a diet with limes. And he showed that the people who had the limes didn't develop scurvy and the others died. So he just watched some nuns get scurvy and die. Not the most ethical experiment we're watching. No, no, yes. Okay. So he's not necessarily the most... He did that in the 1740s and that was... The most ethical person in the world. But he learned that, oh, the limes will at least, it seemed, prevent scurvy or lack of a Lyme. Because remember, what a vitamin is, and this is key, what a vitamin is, is something the body can't synthesize enough of. So for example, a mouse has an enzyme that allows it to synthesize vitamin C. So in a mouse, it wouldn't be called vitamin C, it would just be called a scopic acid because it's not really a vitamin. Interesting, interesting. So if we were mouse doctors, we would just call it, we would call it a scopic acid. Exactly. I mean, if we were mice, we'd call it a scopic acid too. Exactly. Or they probably have their own language. Right, right, right. But in all of us, we have certain things that we have to get from the outside, from food, and those are called vitamins and minerals. So a vitamin doesn't mean that more is better, it doesn't mean that is good for you, it just remains that you require a small amount of it and your body can't synthesize it. So this guy right here, he does the clinical trials with the nuns. He figures out that Lyme, people who have fruit and who have Lyme, they're not getting scurvy. And so he sends out a bunch of Lyme with the British, the Navy, during the Napoleonic Wars and that's why they're called Lymeies. And I guess apparently they won the war because of that, because once you're at war, you're several weeks to see at sea, the French Navy is getting decimated with scurvy, because they're not getting, they're eating dry, they're eating beef jerky or whatever else they might be eating, they're not getting fruit. And it was really, so because of that discovery, because of that discovery that the British won the Battle of Trafalgar. Exactly. And I mean, there are two lessons from it. One is, you know, you can't just say generically Lyme. Right. How the fruit is, how it's cared for, you know, once he juiced it and put it at room temperature, it was all gone. Right. So besides the fact that this guy did a clinical trial that was, you know, killed a bunch of nuns, he also said, hey, this is a business opportunity. Right. I've just shown, maybe he felt that he didn't get, you know, compensated properly for saving the British fleet from Napoleon and says, I'm going to make a business out of this. And so he decides to start taking Lyme juice extract and starts to sell it as a cure for, what happened? Because it didn't work. Once you squeeze it out of the Lyme, it degrades the vitamin C. Literally, it's called oxidizes. Right. And it happens when it's exposed to light and oxygen at room temperature almost instantaneously. I see. So what happened was is that when the soldiers were eating the Lyme in their whole form, sure you might chew on a little bit, you might cut it a little bit, but there's whole pieces of Lyme that were not exposed where the vitamin C wasn't exposed to the air or whatever else that actually got into someone's system. Exactly. And in Tropicana, when they sell you orange juice, it's in a carburic container that gets no light in and it's refrigerated. Right. Because that keeps the vitamin C intact. Right. But because people didn't realize that, because they said, hey, okay, for whatever reason, they didn't get scurvy during Trafalgar, but hey, we have the Lyme extract and that's not preventing scurvy, people kind of gave up on that whole hypothesis that it was about the vitamin C. That's what you're saying. As recent as the 1920s, people thought it was about, it was some type of an infectious disease. So the key is when you start to look at data, you have to look at all aspects of it. And somebody smart should have looked and said, listen, how he did his first experiment was different than what he was selling and trying to validate. That's interesting. And if someone had looked at that for 200 years, we would have saved a lot of lives. Because remember, it was from 1946 till the 1930s when we discovered what vitamin C truly was. And so a lot of lives were lost then because nobody paid attention. Fascinating. And then there's these other side effects of, one, you don't know, a vitamin doesn't necessarily mean a good thing. That's something that's kind of programmed into us maybe by the nutraceutical industry. But even if it is a good thing, it's not necessarily even a good thing to get it in a processed form. And this isn't some type of tree-hugging, organic. There's some science here that, look, if something is an antioxidant and it gets exposed to oxygen or some other oxidizing agent, it's not going to be able to do any good anymore. It's chemistry. And so that's where the whole actual fruit is going to be more valuable. Remember, one orange has a couple of milligrams of vitamin C, one, two, three milligrams. One pill has 500 milligrams. So whoever is making those pills kind of forgot what was going on in nature. Right, right. Fascinating. This is very good.
