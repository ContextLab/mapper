Storing bread in the refrigerator delays drying and the growth of mold, but increase the rate at which the bread loses flavor. So that already felt a little bit strange, especially right around here, but let's think about why it feels strange. So what's the subject? The subject is storing bread in the refrigerator. It is singular. It is a singular action. The singular action of storing bread in the refrigerator. This right over here is singular. We have a singular subject, and then we see it right over here where later on, and once again, the word delays isn't up for debate. They didn't underline this as a potential error place, but this is a singular version of the verb delay. So this right over here is also singular. So this verb right over here, this singular verb agrees with the singular subject. If you have a singular subject, let me do that same magenta color, if you have a singular subject, then you should have a singular verb. So this makes sense. Storing bread in the refrigerator delays drying in the growth of mold. But then over here we say but increase. Increase, this is the plural form of the verb. So this really should be increases to make it singular, to give it the singular form of the verb. For this verb to agree with the singular subject, it needs to be but increases the rate at which the bread loses flavor. So the error is definitely where we suspected. It's in this little, it's in this part of the sentence.
