Let's think about how put options can give us leverage on a downside, or I should say on a bet that the stock will go down relative to shorting. This one's a little bit more complicated because shorting is a little bit less intuitive. If you were to short a stock, in order to short it, you might say, hey, wait, I don't have to put any money up front because I essentially just borrowed the stock immediately and then I would sell it for $50. The reality is you do have to put some capital up front because the short can move against you and usually you have to put at least 50% of the value of the short. In our short scenario, you would have to put at least $25 up front and then you would borrow the stock, sell it for $50. You would essentially have $75 to play with that you would eventually have to use to buy back the stock, but the up front capital is $25. In our scenario where the stock went down, which was a good thing if you're shorting, you want the stock, that was your bet, you want it to go down. In the scenario where the stock went down to $20, you made a profit of $30. You were able to buy that stock for $20 and then give it back to the original person, so you were able to keep that $50, although net for that $20, so you made $30. You made $30 on a $25 investment. Your gain, you make $100 and what is that? You make $25 and then another $5, so that's 120% gain. Let me write that down. You made 120% gain. Of course in this scenario, you gained when the stock went down. In terms of loss here, when the stock went up, the stock went up to $80, we lost $30 by shorting, so we had a 120% loss. It's again, 120% loss. It's important to realize, in a short situation, the best thing that can happen for you is your stock go to zero, in which case you can buy it back for nothing, which means you could keep your $50. In the best possible scenario, you had to put $25 up front, you can keep the $50 that you got from borrowing and selling the stock, so you can make a 200% return. In the worst case scenario, so this is the best scenario, this is 200%. In the worst case, this would be infinite, so you have to be very careful while you're shorting, but let's think about the put option. In the put option, we only had to put $5 up front to actually buy the put. When the stock went down to $20, when the stock went down to $20, we made $15, so this was a 300% gain. On the other side of the equation, when the stock went up, the worst we could do is just lose all of our money. The worst thing we could do is just lose 100%. Once again, we were able to multiply our gains relative to shorting, although it's a little bit more mixed on the downside, because the put gives you a little bit of protection there.
