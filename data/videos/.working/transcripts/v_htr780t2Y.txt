Hi, this is Sal Khan, founder of the Khan Academy, and I'm just here to remind everyone watching that Khan Academy is a not-for-profit organization, which means no one owns Khan Academy, we are a public charity, and we are dependent on donations. And donations from folks like you are what allow us to create the content and the interactive software that you and folks like you use. And so I encourage you to think of making a donation. Even a few dollars from everyone watching this video would cover Khan Academy's costs for the coming year. We're a small team here at Khan Academy, under 100 folks, and we're literally reaching tens of millions of people every month. And so the social return on investment here is quite high. So once again, really encourage you to consider donating even a few dollars. Thank you.
