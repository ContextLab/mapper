So there are situations where you have some type of a function, this is clearly a non-linear function, f of x is equal to one over x minus one, this is its graph or at least part of its graph right over here, but where you wanna approximate it with a linear function, especially around a certain value. And so what we're going to do is we wanna find an approximation, let me write this down, I wanna find an approximation for, and actually let me be clear, I wanna find a linear approximation, so I'm gonna approximate it with a line. I wanna find a linear approximation, approximation of f, of f around, and you need to know where you're going to be approximating it, around x equals negative one. So what do we mean by that? Well let's look at this graph over here. On this curve, when x is equal to negative one, f of negative one is negative, is negative one half, which sticks us right over there, let me do this in a better color, so it's right over there, and what we wanna do is approximate it with a line around that. And what we're essentially going to do is we're gonna approximate it with the equation of the tangent line. The tangent line is going to look something, something like that, and as we can see, as we get further and further from x equals negative one, the approximation gets worse and worse, but if we stay around x equals negative one, well it's a decent, it is as good as you can get for a linear approximation, or at least in this example, it is a very good linear approximation. So when people say, hey, find a linear approximation of f around x equals negative one, or if they say, what is the following is the best approximation, and all of your choices are lines, well essentially they're asking you to find the equation of the tangent line at x equals negative one. So let's do that. So in order to find the equation of the tangent line, the equation of a line is y is equal to mx plus b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. There's other ways that you could think about it. You could think about it in terms of point slope, where you could say y minus some y that sits on that line is equal to the slope times x minus the corresponding x1. So x1 comma y1 sits on that line someplace. Actually, I like to write this point slope form like this sometimes. Y minus y1 over x minus x1 is equal to b, because this comes straight out of the idea of, look, if x1 and y1 are on the line, the slope between any other point on the line and that point is going to be your slope of your line. So we could think about it any of these ways. So let's first find the slope of the tangent line, and that's where the derivative is useful. So f, well actually let me just write f of x again. So I'm gonna write it as x minus one to the negative one power, because that makes it a little bit clearer that we can use the power rule and a little bit of the chain rule. So the derivative of f with respect to x is equal to, so the derivative of x minus one to the negative one with respect to x minus one, well that's just going to be, we're just going to use the power rule here. It's gonna be negative one times x minus one to the negative two, and then we're going to multiply that times the derivative of x minus one with respect to x. Well that's just going to be one. The derivative of x with respect to x is one. the derivative of negative one with respect to x is zero. So we could say times one here if we like, or we could just not write that because it doesn't change the value. And so let's evaluate that when x is equal to negative one. So f prime of negative one is equal to, I could just write this as negative, all right, look this way, negative one over negative one minus one squared. And so this is going to be negative two down here. So this is equal to negative negative one fourth. So the slope of our tangent line is, so I could write this way, m is equal to negative one negative one fourth. And so now we just have to write its equation down. So we already know an x one and a y one that sits on the line. And in fact, we want to use the point when x equals negative one. So we know that the point negative one comma, we could just input it right over here, f of negative one is negative one half, one over negative one minus one negative one half. So we know that this negative one comma negative one half, that that is on our curve and it is on our line, that's the point at which the tangent and the curve actually intersect. And so we can use any of these to now write the equation of our line. We could say y, I'll do it right here, y minus y one, so minus negative one half, is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to our slope, negative one fourth, I'm just using the point slope version of our equation, is equal to our slope times x minus x one. So x minus our x coordinate that we know sits on this. So minus negative one. And so let me now write all of this in a neutral color, this will be y plus one half is equal to, and I can, so this is going to be plus one right over there. So I can distribute the negative one fourth, so it's negative one fourth x minus one fourth, minus one fourth, and then I can subtract one half from both sides. So I'm going to get y is equal to negative one fourth x, and then if I already am subtracting one fourth and I subtract another half, it's going to be negative three fourths, so minus three, minus three fourths. So, and that's actually pretty close to what I drew up here. This should be intersecting the y axis at negative three fourths. So there you have it. This line, or you could even say this equation, is going to be a very good linear approximation, about as good as you can get for linear approximation, for that non-linear function around x equals negative one. You might say, well why didn't they just ask me to find the equation of the tangent line at x equals negative one? Well they could have, but there's a little bit of extra cognitive processing here where you say, okay, I can actually use the equation of the tangent line to approximate this function around x equals negative one.
