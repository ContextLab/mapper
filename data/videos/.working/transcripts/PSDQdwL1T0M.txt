Scarlet and Hansel's teacher gave them a system of linear equations to solve. They each took a few steps that lead to the systems shown in the table below. So this is the teacher system, this is what Scarlet got after taking some steps, this is what Hansel got. Which of them obtained a system that is equivalent to the teacher's system? And just to remind ourselves, an equivalent system is a system that has, or at least for our purposes, is a system that has the same solution, or the same solution set. So if there's a certain x, y that satisfies this system in order for Scarlet's system to be, for it to be equivalent, it needs to have the same solution. So let's look at this. So Scarlet, let's see, let's see if we can match these up. So her second equation here, so this is interesting, her second equation, 14x minus seven y is equal to two, over here the teacher has an equation, 14x minus seven y is equal to seven. So this is interesting, because the ratio between x and y is the same, but then your constant term, the constant term is going to be different. And I would make the claim that this alone tells you that Scarlet's system is not equivalent to the teacher, and you're saying, well, how can I say that? Well, these two equations, if you were to write them into slope-intercept form, you would see, because the ratio between x and y, the x and y terms is the same, you're going to have the same slope, but you're gonna have different y-intercepts. In fact, we can actually solve for that. So this equation right over here, we can write it as, if we, let's see, if we subtract 14x from both sides, you get negative seven y minus 14, whoops, negative seven y is equal to, is equal to negative 14x plus seven. And we can divide both sides by negative seven. You get y is equal to two x minus one. So that's this, all I did is algebraically manipulate this, this is this line, and I could even try to graph it. Let's do that. So I'll draw a quick coordinate. This is just gonna be very rough, quick coordinate axis right over there. And then this line, this line, would look something like this. So it's y-intercept is negative one, and it has a slope of two. So let me draw a line with a slope of, a line with a slope of two, might look something, something like that. So that's this line right over here, or this one right over there. And let's see, this one over here is going to be, if we do the same algebra, we're going to have negative seven y is equal to negative 14x plus two, or y is equal to, I'm just dividing everything by negative seven, two x minus two sevenths. So this is gonna look something like this. It's y-intercept is minus two sevenths. It's like right over there. So this line is gonna look something like, I'm gonna draw my best attempt at drawing it. It's gonna look something, it's gonna look, actually that's not quite right. It's gonna look something like, actually I'll just start right over here. It's gonna look something like, something like this. It's gonna have the same slope, and obviously it goes in this direction as well. Actually let me just draw that. It's gonna have the same slope, but a different y-intercepts, that doesn't look right, but you get the idea. These two lines are parallel. So these two lines are parallel. So any coordinate that satisfies this one is not going to satisfy this one. They have no points in common. They are parallel. That's the definition of parallel. Since this and this have no points in common, there's no way that some solution set that satisfies this would satisfy this, because any xy that satisfies this can't satisfy this, or vice versa. There are no points. These two things will never intersect. So Scarlett does not have an equivalent system. Now what about, what about Hansel? Well we see Hansel has the same thing going on here. Five x minus y, five x minus y, but then the constant term is different. Negative six, positive three. So this and this also represent parallel lines. Any xy pair that satisfies this, there's no way that it's going to satisfy this. These two lines don't intersect. They are parallel. So Hansen's system is not equivalent either.
