You are graphing rectangle A, B, C, D in the coordinate plane. The following are three of the vertices of the rectangle. They give us the coordinates. What are the coordinates of point D? All right, well, a good place to start. Let's just plot the three vertices that they give us. So it looks like they're all in the first quadrant, so I'm gonna focus my coordinate axes on the first quadrant. So that's going to be my Y axis, and let me now put this gonna be my X axis. And let's see, the highest X value that I have, you have a two, I have a five, I have a five. It looks like it goes up to five. So I could say one, two, three, four, and five. So that's five, I could just, one, two, three, four, and five. And let's see, the highest Y value of one, one, and a six. So it goes up to six. So one, two, three, four, five, and six. Can number them, one, two, three, four, five, and six. Now let's plot the points. So let's first plot point A, which is at two, comma, one. X equals two, Y is equal to one. So that's that point right over there. Now let's plot point B. Point B is at five, comma, one. So X equals five, Y is equal to one. That's right over there. Now let's plot point C. Point C, I need to find another color here. Point C is that X is equal to five, Y is equal to six. X is equal to five, Y is equal to six. So it sticks us roughly right over there. And so we need to figure out what D is going to be. Well, D is going, this is a rectangle. The sides are parallel, all the vertices, we have right angles at all the vertices. So point D is going to have the same X coordinate as this point right over here. So it's gonna have the same X coordinate. So it's going to have an X coordinate, so let me write this. D is going to have an X coordinate of two. And it's gonna have the same Y coordinate as this point up here. So it's gonna have a Y coordinate of six. So D is going to be at the point two, comma, six. And you see when we do that, we have set up a nice rectangle here and we can draw the rectangle. So that's one side, that's the top side. That's another side, another side. And then we have that just like that. There you go, we have our rectangle. But most importantly, we answered our question, what are the coordinates of point D? All right.
