Let's get some practice simplifying radical expressions that involve variables. So let's say I have two times the square root of seven x times three times the square root of 14 x squared. Pause the video and see if you can simplify it, taking any perfect squares out multiplying and then taking any perfect squares out of the radical sign. Well, let's first just multiply this thing. So we can change the order of multiplication. This is going to be the same thing as two times three times the square root of seven x times the square root of 14 x squared. And so this is going to be equal to six times and then the product of two radicals, you could view that as the square root of the product. So six times the square root of, actually I'll just leave it like this, seven times x and then let me actually factor 14. 14 is two times seven times x squared. Actually let me extend my radical sign a little bit. All right, and the reason why I didn't multiply it out, obviously we could have multiplied in our head x times x squared is x to the third and we could have said, all right, seven times 14 is what, 98, we could have done that. But when you're trying to factor out perfect squares, it's actually easier if it's in this factored form here, especially because from a variable point of view, you could view this as a perfect square already. And then 14 is not a perfect square, seven isn't a perfect square, but seven times seven is. Seven times seven is a perfect square, that is 49 of course. So let's rewrite this a little bit to see what we can do. This is going to be six times, and I could write it like this, the square root of, and let's put all the perfect squares first. So seven times seven, that is 49, that's those two, x squared, 49 x squared. And then I could once again separate the two radicals right over here. So whatever else is left. So I've already used a seven, a seven, the x squared, I have a two x left, times two x. Hopefully we appreciate that these two things are equivalent. I could have put one big radical sign over 49 x squared times two x, which would have been exactly what you have there. But if you're taking the radical of the product of things, that's the same thing as the product of the radicals. This comes straight out of our exponent properties. But what's valuable about this is we now see this is six times, now we could take the square root of 49 x squared, that's gonna be seven x. Square root of 49 is seven. Square root of x squared is going to be x. And then we multiply that times the square root of two x. Times the square root of two x. And so now we're in the home stretch. Six times seven is 42 x times the square root of two x. And the key thing to appreciate is I keep using this property that a radical of products, or the square root of products, is the same thing as the product of the square roots. So even this step that I did here, if you wanted, you could have had an intermediary step. You could have said that the square root of 49 x squared is the same thing as square root of 49 times the square root of x squared, which would get us square root of 49 is seven. Square root of x squared is x right over there. Let's do another one of these. So let's say I have square root of two a times the square root of 14 a to the third times the square root of five a. So like always, pause this video and see if you can simplify this on your own. Multiply them and then take all the perfect squares out of the radical. So let's multiply first. So this is gonna be the same thing as the square root of, let's see, two times 14 times five. So let me actually just, I'm just gonna, two and five are prime. 14, I can factor it as two times seven. So this is gonna be two times, instead of 14, I'm gonna write two times seven and then times five. And then we have a times a to the third times a. So actually let me just write that as a to the fifth. We have a to the first times a to the third times a to the first, add the exponents, you get a to the fifth. Now, what perfect squares do we have here? Well, we already see a perfect square in terms of two times two. And then a to the fifth isn't a perfect square if you think in terms of the variable a, but you could view that as a perfect square, a to the fourth times a. So let's rearrange this a little bit. And so this is going to be equal to the square root of, let me put my perfect squares out front. The square root of four, two times two, times a to the fourth, and then let me put my non-perfect squares, times, I have a seven, a five, and an a that I haven't used yet. So seven times five is 35, so it's 35a. And now, just like we said before, we could, well, let me do it, we could say, hey, look, this is the same thing as the square root of four times the square root of a to the fourth, just using exponent properties, and then times the square root of 35a. Now, the principal root of four is positive two, you could view this as a positive square root, and then square root of a to the fourth, the principal root is gonna be a squared, and then we're going to have that times the square root of 35a. And we're done. Let's do one more example. And this time, we're gonna involve two variables, which, as you'll see, isn't that much more complicated. So let's simplify the square root of 72x to the third, z to the third. So the key is, can we factor, 72 is not a perfect square, but is there a perfect square someplace in there? And you immediately see that, if you try to factor it, you get 36 times two, and 36, of course, is a perfect square. And likewise, x to the third and z to the third are not each perfect squares, but they each have an x squared and z squared in them. So let me rewrite this. This is the same thing, this is the same thing as I can write, well, let me put all my perfect squares out front. So I have 36, 36, I'm gonna take an x squared out, x squared, I'm gonna take a z squared out, z squared, and then what we're left with is, we took a 36 out, so we're left with a two times two, and if we took an x squared out of this, we're left with just an x, x to the third divided by x squared is x, two x, and then z to the third divided by z squared is just z. And you can verify this, multiply this all out, you should be getting exactly what we have here, I do that little line on the z to differentiate, so it doesn't look like my twos. 36 times two is 72, x squared times x is x to the third, and z squared times z is z to the third. But now this is pretty straightforward to factor, because let me just, I'll do more steps than you would probably do if you're doing it on your own, but that's because the whole point here is to learn, so two x z, so that's just using exponent properties, and so everything here is a perfect square. This is gonna be the square root of 36 times the square root of x squared times the square root of z squared, which is going to be square root of 36 is, principle root of 36 is six, principle root of x squared is x, principle root of z squared is z, and we're gonna multiply that, times square root of two x z, and we are done.
