You probably know that plenty of colleges offer classes online, but if students need little extra help, more and more of them are finding it now for free on YouTube. Kipto shows us what could be the next generation of online learning. Going to a traditional old school is, well, old school. This is the worldwide headquarters of the Khan Academy. Inside this converted walk-in closet could be the future of education. What you can do here is just distribute this X plus 2Y onto each of these terms. With a headset, an electronic pen, and a zest for learning, Sal Khan records short, bare-bones, 10-minute educational videos and posts them on YouTube. No big deal until you realize there are more than 1,500 of them. So 3 plus 4 is equal to 7. Covering everything from basic addition... The dimension of A transpose. ...to advanced linear algebra... ...to French history... ...and Ponzi schemes, economics mixed with current events. 70,000 people view his bite-sized videos every day at their own pace, all for free. I think what makes this fun for me is the idea that as many people as possible could benefit from it. Khan started recording videos back in 2006 to tutor an out-of-state relative. Since then, it's exploded, and last year he left his lucrative job as a hedge fund analyst and lives off donations to Khan Academy. The 33-year-old says the videos can free up teachers to focus on teaching instead of lecturing. So the teacher says, go home, watch these videos, and then when we come to class the next day, you would have already watched the lecture. I don't have to do that broadcast lecture to you in the classroom, and we'll have to do your homework in the classroom. Accessible, cheap, effective, and sustainable teaching for a wired generation. It is making people think hard about, well, what is the proper role for technology in the classroom? So I do hope it starts a bit of a revolution, but I don't know if I can call myself a revolutionary. Call it Education 2.0. And we are done! In Mountain View, Kitto.
