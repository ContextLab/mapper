Rewrite the expression four times, then in parentheses we have eight plus three using the distributive law of multiplication over addition, then simplify the expression. So let's just try to solve this or evaluate this expression and then we'll talk a little bit about the distributive law of multiplication over addition, usually just called the distributive law. So we have four times eight, four times eight plus three. Now there's two ways to do it. Normally when you have parentheses your inclination is well let me just evaluate what's in the parentheses first and then worry about what's outside of the parentheses and we can do that fairly easily here. We can evaluate what eight plus three is, eight plus three is eleven. So if we do that, let me do that in this direction. So if we do that we get four times and in parentheses we have an eleven. Eight plus three is eleven and then this is going to be equal to, well four times eleven is just forty-four. So you can evaluate it that way but they want us to use the distributive law of multiplication. We did not use the distributive law just now. We just evaluated the expression, we used the parentheses first, then multiplied by four. In the distributive law we multiply by four first and it's called the distributive law because you distribute the four and we're going to think about what that means. So in the distributive law what this will become, it'll become four times eight plus four times three and we're going to think about why that is in a second. So this is going to be equal to four times eight plus four times three. A lot of people's first instinct is just to multiply the four times the eight but no, you have to distribute the four. You have to multiply it times the eight and times the three. This is the distributive property in action. I'm going to show you kind of a visual way why this works. When you evaluate it four times eight is 32 and then so we have 32 plus four times three is 12 and 32 plus 12 is equal to 44. That is also equal to 44. So you can get it either way but when they want us to use the distributive law you'd distribute the four first. Let's think about why that happens. Let's visualize just what eight plus three is. Let me draw eight of something. So one, two, three, four, five, six, let me draw this. Well, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Then we're going to add to that three of something, of maybe the same thing. One, two, three. So you can imagine this is what we have inside of the parentheses. We have eight circles plus three circles. Now, when we're multiplying this whole thing, this whole thing times four, what does that mean? Well, that means we're just going to add this to itself four times. So let me do that with the copy and paste. Copy and then let me paste. There you go. That's two. That's one, two, three. And then we have four. And we're going to add them all together. So this is literally what? Four times, right? Let me go back to the drawing tool. We have it one, two, three, four times this expression, which is eight plus three. Now, what is this thing over here? What is this thing over here? What is this thing over here? If you were to count all of this stuff, you would get 44. But what is this thing over here? Well, that's eight added to itself four times. You can imagine you're adding all of these. So what's eight added to itself four times? That is four times eight. So this is four times eight. And what is this over here in the orange? We have one, two, three, four times. Well, each time we have three. So it's four times this right here. This right here is four times three. So you see why the distributive property works. If you do four times eight plus three, you have to multiply what you, I guess you could imagine, duplicate the thing four times. Both the eight and the three is getting duplicated four times. Or it's being added to itself four times. And that's why we distribute the four.
